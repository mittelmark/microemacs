/*
 * Created:     1st May 1992
 * Synopsis:    The build version definition.
 * Authors:     Jon Green & Steven Phillips
 * Description:
 *     These are put in here so that you wont have to grub around in the depths
 *     of display.c & main.c etc every time you want to remind yourself that
 *     you've hacked emacs by updating the version number.
 *
 * Notes:
 *     The definitions have been moved out of estruct.h, because, if you change
 *     them and you have written your makefile properly, everything gets recompiled
 *     whereas putting them here only makes "make" recompile display.c
 * 
 *     The history was removed from this file as CVS and the help pages are used
 *     instead.

 *        as we have now a version 2023 in preparation. This version will
 *        be called ME 2009 and stick with the year 2009  as the version.
