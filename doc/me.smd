!   Registry
## REGISTRY


  The  registry  commands  provide an  interface to manage the registry  files
  defined by  [erf(8)](erf(8)).  The registry is a mechanism  which allows the
  binding of  information  to a  hierarchical  tree node, using a file  system
  metaphor  to  access  the data.  __MicroEmacs__  uses a  reserved  root node
  `history`  to  save  session  information (see [save-session(3)](save-session(3))).

!   Command Line Filters
## COMMAND LINE FILTERS


  MicroEmacs may be invoked from the command line to perform a specific set of
  filtering   tasks,  under  control  of  a  dedicated  start  up  macro,  see
  [me(1)](me(1)) and  [start-up(3)](start-up(3)).  A number of standard macros  are provided, 
  most of which are invoked automatically from the editor itself  when
  requested by the user. Having said that, it has not been unknown for a
  colleague of mine to use the editor as a replacement for a more  intelligent
  __sed(1)__  filter,  with  12  hours  to go and a huge  ugly  3-D  geometric
  database to convert, what better way than run it through a set of MicroEmacs
  macros  to turn it into  another  database  format  that  can be  handled  -
  probably not for the  uninitiated,  but that person did pull it off and went
  home for tea !!

!   Keyboard Binding Commands
## KEYBOARD BINDING COMMANDS


  Keyboard  binding  allows key strokes to be  associated  with  commands  and
  macros  such  that  when a bound  key  stroke  sequence  is  recognized  its
  associated (or bound) command is invoked, thereby  controlling the editor. A
  set of [Default  Bindings](Bindings(2))  exist for  MicroEmacs  which may be
  altered using the binding commands. There are three types of key bindings:

  __Global__
  >  Associates a key-stroke with a command for all buffers. Used to
     establish the standard keyboard controls i.e. cursor movement, search,
     replace etc.

  __Local__
  >  Associates a key-stroke with a command for a specified buffer only,
     i.e. a binding local to the buffer. Local bindings allow macro
     accelerators to be bound to keys without affecting other buffers
     containing different types of data. Local bindings are used
     extensively in the buffer hook commands.

  __Message Line__
  >  Associates a key binding for use on the command line only, allowing
     command completion to be diverted etc.

  To bind a command  to a key, the  command  and key names  must be known, see
  [Command  Glossary](Command  Glossary)  for a complete  list of commands and
  [Key Names](keyNames(2)) for a complete list of key names.

  The binding related commands are defined as follows:


## Commands 


  [buffer-bind-key(2)](buffer-bind-key(2)) Create local key binding for current buffer  
  [buffer-unbind-key(2)](buffer-unbind-key(2)) Remove local key binding for current buffer  
  [command-apropos(2)](command-apropos(2)) (C-h a) List commands involving a concept  
  [describe-bindings(2)](describe-bindings(2)) (C-h b) Show current command/key binding  
  [describe-key(2)](describe-key(2)) (C-x ?) Report keyboard key name and binding  
  [expand-iso-accents(3)](expand-iso-accents(3)) Expand an ISO accent  
  [global-bind-key(2)](global-bind-key(2)) (esc k) Bind a key to a named command or macro  
  [global-unbind-key(2)](global-unbind-key(2)) (esc C-k) Unbind a key from a named command or macro  
  [iso-accents-mode(3)](iso-accents-mode(3)) ISO accent expansion short-cut mode

  [osd-unbind-key(2)](osd-unbind-key(2)) Remove key binding from OSD dialog  
  [set-char-mask(2)](set-char-mask(2)) Set character word mask  
  [translate-key(2)](translate-key(2)) Translate key  


## Variables 


## Alt Key 


  The __Alt Key__ has special binding priorities defined as follows:-

  - Direct key binding (e.g. __A-b__ executes [file-browser](file-browser(3)))
  - Main menu hot key (e.g. __A-f__ opens the File menu)
  - Meta key binding (e.g. __A-space__ -> __esc space__ -> [set-mark](set-mark(2)))

  If the  `ALT`  key is to be used  strictly  as the  Emacs  Meta key then the
  bindings for the menu should be  over-ridden  by _Direct Key Bindings_  from
  the user configuration file i.e. to re-map the default MicroEmacs Alt key to
  equivalent `esc` keys then the following keys should be re-bound.

```{.emf}
        global-bind-key forward-word "A-f"      ; Over-ride File menu binding
        :                                       ; For all of the other menu items.
        :
        global-bind-key backward-word "A-b"     ; Over-ride the file browser.
        global-bind-key replace-string "A-r"    ; Over-ride tools binding.

```

  This  creates a higher  priority  binding  which  overrides  the  underlying
  default.  The  commands  that are  displaced  would have to be  re-bound  to
  different keys if required.

!   Buffer Manipulation Commands
## BUFFER MANIPULATION COMMANDS


  A buffer is where MicroEmacs  stores text. Normally text is read from
  a file and is visible in an editing [window](Window Commands). The name, associated

!   Window Commands
## WINDOW COMMANDS


  MicroEmacs uses windows to display and allow you to edit the contents of
  [buffers](Buffer Manipulation Commands). Multiple windows may be present on the [screen](Hilighting, Color and Screen Appearance) at once, each is
  separated by a [mode line](Mode Line) which describes the contents of the window above it.

  You can scroll text vertically and horizontally within a window by using
  the [cursor](Cursor  Movement  Commands)  commands.  Note that if a line of text extends  beyond the
  boundary of a window, a dollar "__$__" sign is displayed instead of the 
  first/last visible character.

  Commands that operate on windows are defined as follows:

!   Introduction to Variable Functions
!   Variable Functions
## VARIABLE FUNCTIONS


  Functions can be used to manipulate variables in various ways. Functions
  have in general one, two, or three arguments. These arguments will always
  be placed after the function on the current command line. For example, if
  we wanted to increase the current fill column by two, using MicroEmacs's
  [set-variable(2)](set-variable(2)) (C-x v) command, we would write:

       set-variable $fill-col &add $fill-col 2
              \            \      \       \     \____second operand
               \            \      \       \_________first operand
                \            \      \________________function to execute
                 \            \______________________variable to set
                  \__________________________________set-variable (C-x v) command


  Functions always begin with an ampersand (__&__) character, and are only
  significant to the first 3 characters after the ampersand. Functions will
  normally expect one of three types of arguments, and will automatically
  convert types when needed.

  __<num>__
  >  An ASCII string of digits which is interpreted as a numeric value. Any
     string which does not start with a digit or a minus sign (-) will be
     considered zero.

  __<str>__
  >  An arbitrary string of characters. At the moment, strings are limited
     to 128 characters in length.

  __<log>__
  >  A logical value consisting of a non-zero number for __TRUE__ (e.g. "`1`"),
     anything else is considered __FALSE__ (e.g. "`0`" or "`foo`"). This differs
     from earlier versions of MicroEmacs where the strings "`TRUE`" and
     "`FALSE`" were used.

!   Mode Line
## MODE LINE


  The __modeLine__ is the line of text shown at the bottom of each
  [window](Window Commands) identifying the window being displayed.
  The mode line typically contains the name of the 
  [buffer](Buffer Manipulation Commands), the file and operating mode
  associated with the buffer displayed in the window. e.g.

       #*-me (BEI) - 250 foo (foo.txt) ----------------


  __Note__ that only a sub-set of the modes are visible on the mode line, this
  reduces the cluttering of the mode line. Use the [about(2)](about(2)) command to
  determine the exact modes that are active.

  The text content and color of the mode line is fully configurable and may
  be defined in the users start-up script. The currently active buffer is
  generally indicated by the state of the mode line, e.g. highlighted color
  (typically red) and/or double line separator characters __===__; conversely
  inactive buffers are shown in a dull color with single line separator
  characters __---__.

  The mode line may be configured or interrogated using the following
  variables:-

  [$buffer-mode-line(5)]($buffer-mode-line(5)) Buffer mode line string  
  [$mode-chars(5)]($mode-chars(5)) Mode characters  
  [$mode-line(5)]($mode-line(5)) Mode line format  
  [$mode-line-scheme(5)]($mode-line-scheme(5)) Mode line color scheme  
  [$show-modes(5)]($show-modes(5)) Select buffer modes to display  
  [$window-mode-line(5)]($window-mode-line(5)) Window mode line position  
  [$window-scroll-bar(5)]($window-scroll-bar(5)) Window scroll bar (or separator) position

## And Finally ....


  Answers to those burning questions that people ask from time to time ...


## Where does the name JASSPA come from ? 


  The current maintainers initials mixed up, padded out to make words, short
  listed and searched on the WWW to find a unique name. This process took
  approximately two months.


## How was the JASSPA logo derived ? 


  The logo was derived from the program initials Me. Given the limited
  number of pixels available in an icon then the 'e' was superimposed in the
  center of the 'M'. With some further refinement the legs of the 'M' were
  later lost leaving a triangular shape - this was then adopted as the
  iconic outline. The colored lines at the top and bottom portray the visual
  appearance of a JASSPA's MicroEmacs from afar when viewing an X-term
  running me within an X-Windows environment. The blue line representing the
  window header color (that I use), the red line representing the MicroEmacs
  mode bar; the screen was typically black with white or yellow characters.
  The icon was incrementally refined over a period of approximately six
  months.

         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
         of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

               Preamble

          The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
     freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
     License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
     software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
     General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
     Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
     using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
     the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
     your programs, too.

          When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
     price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
     have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
     this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
     if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
     in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

          To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
     anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
     These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
     distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

          For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
     gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
     you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
     source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
     rights.

          We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
     (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
     distribute and/or modify the software.

          Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
     that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
     software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
     want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
     that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
     authors' reputations.

          Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
     patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
     program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
     program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
     patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

          The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
     modification follow.

              GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

          0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
     a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
     refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
     means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
     that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
     either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
     language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
     the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
     covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
     running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
     is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
     Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
     Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

          1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
     and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
     along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
     you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

          2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

            a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

            b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
            whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
            part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
            parties under the terms of this License.

            c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
            when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
            interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
            announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
            notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
            a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
            these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
            License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
            does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
            the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
     and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
     themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
     sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
     distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
     on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
     this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
     entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
     your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
     exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
     collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
     with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
     the scope of this License.

          3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
     Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

            a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
            source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
            1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

            b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
            years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
            cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
            machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
            distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
            customarily used for software interchange; or,

            c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
            to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
            allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
            received the program in object code or executable form with such
            an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
     code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
     associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
     control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
     special exception, the source code distributed need not include
     anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
     form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
     operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
     itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

          4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
     However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
     this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
     parties remain in full compliance.

          5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
     distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
     prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
     modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
     all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
     the Program or works based on it.

          6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
     these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
     restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
     You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
     this License.

          7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
     conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
     excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
     distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
     License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
     may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
     license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
     all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
     the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
     refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
     any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
     apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
     circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
     such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
     integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
     to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
     impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
     be a consequence of the rest of this License.

          8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
     original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
     may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
     those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
     countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
     the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

          9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
     of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
     be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
     address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
     specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
     later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
     either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
     this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
     Foundation.

          10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
     to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
     Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
     make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
     of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
     of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

               NO WARRANTY

          11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
     FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
     OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
     PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
     OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
     TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
     REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

          12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
     WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
     REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
     INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
     OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
     TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
     YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
     POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

               END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

          If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
     possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
     free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

          To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
     to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
     convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
     the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

            <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
            Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

            This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
            it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
            the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
            (at your option) any later version.

            This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
            but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
            MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
            GNU General Public License for more details.

            You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
            along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
            Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

     Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

     If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
     when it starts in an interactive mode:

            Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
            Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
            This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
            under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

     The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
     parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
     be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
     mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

     You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
     school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
     necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

          Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
          `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

          <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
          Ty Coon, President of Vice

     This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
     proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
     consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
     library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
     Public License instead of this License.

          GNU Free Documentation License
             Version 1.1, March 2000

         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
         of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

     0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
     the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
     modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
     this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
     credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
     modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
     complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
     software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
     program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
     software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
     it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
     whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
     principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
     under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
     such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
     addressed as "you".

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
     the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
     (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
     within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
     textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
     mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
     connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
     commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
     them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
     are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
     as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
     the Document is released under this License.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
     pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
     drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
     for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
     to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
     format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
     subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
     not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
     or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
     HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
     PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
     by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
     processing tools are not generally available, and the
     machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
     purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
     this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
     formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
     the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
     preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
     to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
     conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
     technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
     copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
     compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
     number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
     you may publicly display copies.

     3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
     and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
     the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
     Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
     the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
     you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
     the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
     visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
     Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
     the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
     as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
     pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
     more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
     copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
     a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
     Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
     general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
     charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
     option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
     distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
     Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
     until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
     copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
     the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
     Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
     them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
     the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
     the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
     Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
     and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
     of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
           from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
           (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
           of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
           if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
           responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
           Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
           Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
           Modified Version, as the publisher.
     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
           adjacent to the other copyright notices.
     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
           giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
           terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
           and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
     I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
           it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
           publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
           there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
           stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
           given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
           Version as stated in the previous sentence.
     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
           public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
           the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
           it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
           You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
           least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
           publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
     K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
           preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
           substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
           and/or dedications given therein.
     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
           unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
           or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
     M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
           may not be included in the Modified Version.
     N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
           or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
     copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
     of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
     list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
     These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
     standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
     passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
     of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
     Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
     includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
     by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
     you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
     permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
     give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
     imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
     License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
     versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
     Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
     list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
     license notice.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
     different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
     adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
     author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
     Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
     Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
     in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
     "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
     and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
     entitled "Endorsements."

     6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
     released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
     License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
     the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
     verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
     it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
     License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
     other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
     and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
     distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
     of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
     compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
     License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
     with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
     covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
     Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

     8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
     Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License provided that you also include the
     original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
     between the translation and the original English version of this
     License, the original English version will prevail.

     9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
     as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
     copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
     automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
     parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
     License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
     parties remain in full compliance.

     10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
     of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
     If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
     License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
     following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
     of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
     number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
     as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

     ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

     To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
     the License in the document and put the following copyright and
     license notices just after the title page:

              Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
              Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
              under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
              or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
              with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
              Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
              A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
              Free Documentation License".

     If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
     instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
     Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
     "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

     If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
     recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
     free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
     to permit their use in free software.

## HISTORY


  This version of MicroEmacs is based on an early _MicroEmacs_ release of 3.8
  in 1988, the origins of which are unknown, except to say it was delivered
  on a unmarked 5 1/2 floppy disk.

  The program was originally ported to a Motorola MVME147 UNIX box as an
  alternative to __vi__. Reliability of the program proved to be a problem as it
  constantly crashed. In an attempt to rectify the problems the development
  of MicroEmacs commenced.

  Development has continued from 1988 through to today, on the whole
  oblivious to further developments of the existing __MicroEmacs__ program. This
  was due to no Internet access. It was not until 1996 the next version of
  __MicroEmacs__ and __mewin__ (Microsoft Windows (TM) port of the same program) was
  downloaded from the Internet and compared. By this time MicroEmacs was
  radically different and we were not about to mesh the two together - that
  would be a step backwards.

  Development of MicroEmacs has been biased towards the UNIX platform, as
  most of the early development was performed in the UNIX domain. The first
  of the window servers was X-Windows, which in turn has shaped the
  implementation of the Microsoft Windows port. Latterly, we have seen the
  resurgence of the IBM-PC platform which is now commonplace. For the return
  port to the DOS environment, and subsequent development of the Microsoft
  Windows port, a UNIX like interface was required. Most existing users
  could not abide the primitive editors found on these machines; Microsoft
  Windows was an alien and hostile environment when compared with UNIX.
  Hence, the MicroEmacs interface utilizes UNIX style cut and paste across
  all platforms.

  For portability, MicroEmacs utilizes character rendering on all platforms
  regardless of the window manager. Under X-Windows and Microsoft Windows,
  the display is still treated as a character based display, the subtle
  difference is that the display pane is re-sizable. This means that the
  scroll bars, fonts etc. are not as slick as they could be, certainly under
  Microsoft Windows MicroEmacs looks positively primitive!! Regardless of
  the look, the goal of a common editor across all working platforms has
  been achieved!

   without going to a buffer (uses relatively recent improvements to
   shell-command)

    out-of-date buffers (uses new &bstat) if 0 arg is given then it
    rereads all as before.
  - [081005] Protected ME from potential crash when homedir is NULL.
  - [081002] File types, fixed abort caused by empty files.
  - [081002] page-file; implemented a new -u/-U option to limit the size

    Added file being loaded to file history.
  - [070923] jst; Added support for tables being terminated by a ]? on

    otherwise the hilighting persists in *compile* buffer across
    multiple compiles etc
  - [070920] Added a bit 0x02 to the compile command to run the ipipe
    command without wrap (required if '&lt;filename&gt;:&lt;line&gt;: Error' lines

    further '/' added, this fixes several file loading problems.
  - [070524] Changed file saving prompts to be like delete-buffer, they

    (query-)replace-string-in-files commands.
  - [061205] Implemented new (query-)replace-string-in-files commands
    based on new find. Changed default for grep to not use -l (use
    find-setup to do this). Changed -x option so it always ignores
    auto-save files.

    affecting the highlighting, indentation, key binding etc.
    The [major-mode-setup(3)](major-mode-setup(3)) configures the behavior of the major mode.
  - Introduction of sessions which store the context of editor including
    window layout and loaded files. Multiple sessions may be 
    used,   "__me__ __-c___&lt;sessionName&gt;_"   restores  a  specific
    session.  [save-session(3)](save-session(3)) and  [read-session(3)](read-session(3))  handle

    change the indentation of a region.
  - The default date format may be specified by the user
    with [.ascii-time.format(5)](.ascii-time.format(5)).

  - [060925] Added a '`g`' (goto) to __save-some-buffers__ prompt.
  - [060925] Cosmetic changes to __buffer-info__, 2nd Col to 'ACol' and
    printed current character in decimal as well.
  - [060921] Improved the notes display to better preserve the current
    notes file.
  - [060921] Stopped [read-session(3)](read-session(3)) from trying to restore lock and
    save buffer modes.
  - [060921] Improved the __query-replace__ prompt to list letter options

    buffer.
  - [060919] Build. Added $MAKEWINDEFS and LIBS to the ME_WINDOW
    defines, removed references to xpm from the makefiles as this is not
    a standard package and moved references out of _emain.h_ into
    _unixterm.c_. Vamped up build shell script to check for X11 & Xpm
    availability. Changed horrid dos style empty string tests in UNIX
    scripts with __-z__ & __-n__ test options
  - [060918] Standardized the form of character input prompts and
    improved routine so '`?`' swaps between help and prompt. Added a '`N(o)`
    `to` `all`' option to [save-some-buffers(2)](save-some-buffers(2)) and changed [fill-paragraph(2)](fill-paragraph(2))

    string
  - [060917] Corrected the X-Windows ordering to allow us to receive
    (Un)Map events on Linux - X-Server behavior is different from Sun
    Solaris.
  - [060917] UNIX. Added XPM colour bitmap support. Just smartens the ME
    icon up in Gnome and makes ME look a bit more 21st century without
    the monochrome icon.

    Requires that the X-Window is unmapped before the size hint may be
    modified and the re-mapped.
  - [060915] Notes. Fixed [next-frame(2)](next-frame(2)) prefered selection order.
  - [060915] OSD. Sanitised the quick file open and file type buffer
    open menus and changed them to use a scrolled list if more
    files/buffers than lines rather than filling the screen.
  - [060915] In notes find a file that is loaded but out of date, this
    leads to an reread prompt during which the notes ehook/idle callback
    kicks in and changes frame - this breaks the message line of both
    frames. This is a rather horrid fix to a rather grotty problem!
  - [060915] Browser, fixed the sort order to be case sensitive on UNIX,
    insensitive on Windows
  - [060914] User setup. Stopped user-setup's apply from losing the
    current session's override colour scheme
  - [060914] ClearCase. Fixed Describe context menu hotkey overload.
    Used `-mkpath` to implement a '_checkout parent_' for __cc-add__.
  - [060913] Notes. Fixed the loosing of edit and crypt mode from the
    main notes buffer due to the setting of the major mode. Fixed notes
    tree context menu hot keys.
  - [060913] Fixed kill-list tool up-date trashing the real kill ring.
  - [060912] Changed session-update to store view mode for a buffer only
    if it was forced on by the user (i.e. the file is not readonly).
    This stops files re-loading in view mode if the permissions have
    changed - this was a problem with ClearCase reported by Enver Haase.
  - [060912] Simplified the new note-setup and fixed the notes buffer
   losing the hide mode (which causes problems for session restore).
  - [060911] Removed the notes 'note' dummy hook in favour of using a
   real hook. Set the default hook to be jst but can be set in the -!-
   enf; major-mode: \<hook\> -!- header. Added new note-setup which users
   buffer-setup to allow the user to setup the buffer and stores the
   values for that note.
  - [060908] File browser, bound a [file-attrib(3)](file-attrib(3)) based 'Change File
    Attributes' option to 'g'
  - [060908] Changed [file-attrib(3)](file-attrib(3)) to handle directory buffers
    correctly and, with a numeric arg of 0, change the attibutes of a
    given file (i.e. not the current buffer) Implementation changed to
    now have a Cancel button.
  - [060908] File tool, implemented new `%"...%"` tag to enable proper
    quoting of arguments.
  - [060907] Fixed startup buffer hilighting issue caused by order of
    session restore.
  - [060905] ColdFusion template, added string highlighting to the SQL
    statements.
  - [060905] File browser, added binary edit, bound to 'b'.
  - [060905] Added basic xml "`/>`" single tag support to html and fixed
    xml's insert-attrib to handle this
  - [060905] Changed refences to _white-char*_ to whitespaces (i.e.
    display-white-chars is now display-whitespace) Fixed hide main menu
    to popup an info dialog informing the user how to get it back.
  - [060905] Fixed ftp dialog to conform to new _\<user\>.erf_ setup
    standard by adding a new 'Make Default' dialog, and improved the
    behaviour of Enter in the dialog.
  - [060904] Corrected the ColdFusion closing bracket hgilight.
  - [060904] Shortened the document template formating menu text
    strings.
  - [060829] Fixed HTML template __html-insert-tag__ to add the closing "`/`"
    on insertion of a "`<singleTag/>`". Fixed __html-insert-attrib__ to deal
    with attribute insertion into a HTML tag ending in "`/>`".

    and  [insert-password(3)](insert-password(3)). 
  - [060816] Added settings for fill-col and
    fill-mode to the [major-mode-setup(3)](major-mode-setup(3)).
  - [060816] Added support for a "`.fhook-???.fill-*`" variable and
    changed latex over to using this variable rather than burning the
    fill-mode in as 'l'
  - [060816] Crossword - Changed Exit button to Close.
  - [060816] Changed organizer Exit buttons to Close or Cancel.
  - [060812] Additions to the PHP script - missing tags etc.
  - [060812] Corrected sun keysym inclusion - inclusion limited to
    X-Windows build only
  - [060811] Fixed session resize issue and incremented the version.
  - [060811] Added $buffer-fill-* variables to the buffer-setup dialog
  - [060811] Stopped read-session warning about the *server* buffer
    being a process.
  - [060811] Updated to use the new $buffer-fill-* variables -
    simplifies the doc hooks as ehooks and bhooks are no longer
    required.

    sunos
  - [060811] Introduced new $buffer-fill-col and $buffer-fill-mode
    variables to allow every buffer to have its own setting, initialized
    to the global variable value when the buffer is created.
  - [060810] Added 'a' for All option to the save-some-buffers prompt
  - [060810] Added save -> prompt -> delete of all buffers when loading
    another session. If bit 1 in arg is not set (i.e. 0 read-session
    "name") then this is not done and the new session is effectively
    merged into the current.
  - [060810] Added setting of main buffer modes to the buffer-setup osd.
  - [060807] Updated emulation modes to handle the new main menu.
  - [060807] Fixed major mode drop down list to not scroll horizontally
  - [060807] A few tweaks to help with the other editor emulation.
  - [060807] Fixed major-mode-setup so Cancel cancels all changes (was
    50-50)
  - [060807] Removed old buffer-setup file and fixed the makefile

  - [060807] Tweaks to osd to remove a few annoyances: up on main menu
    now goes to last item of current sub menu, fixed re-frame and focus
    issue on an opened child and made C-g always just close a child even
    if not in focus.
  - [060803] Added new -2 and -3 values for 2nd arg to &lins to insert
    alphabetically and case insensitive alpha.
  - [060803] Added setting of the major mode to the new buffer-setup
  - [060803] Changed osd dialogs to use 'Cancel' or 'Close' rather than
    'Exit'
  - [060803] Closed notes if open when applying changes as this corrupts
    the notes frame.
  - [060803] Made the buffer sub-menu be case insensitively ordered in
    windows and have first letter hotkeys.
  - [060803] Changed frame-id comparison to use seq as should handle
    "ERROR" better.
  - [060803] Fixed notes to handle a reread-file type operation.
  - [060803] Changed osd dialogs to use 'Cancel' or 'Close' rather than
    'Exit'
  - [060802] Added saving the session to save-all and associated a file
    in $user-path with the File->New command.
  - [060801] Set .gz extracted buffer name and file name so its location
    is kept.
  - [060728] Fixed clear-case to handle multi-line comments with SHELL
    set to csh.
  - [060728] Changed "symbol" to "insert-symbol" and "indent-setup" to
    "buffer-setup" as this is what it will become. Fixed a few hot-key
    issues with new main menu.
  - [060728] Improved help page and looked for context-menu binding to
    support esc +.
  - [060728] Moved the location of making CVS and clear-case always
    available into their setup dialog and added a C-x C-q replacement
    option.
  - [060728] Changed backspace in a directory to move to the
    sub-directory in the parent listing.
  - [060728] Fixed notes startup so it returns the user to the same
    place.
  - [060728] Documentation, replaced -ve with negative and +ve with
    positive.
  - [060726] gdiff. Added termcap friendly key bindings to move between
    difference regions.
  - [060726] Added new indent-increase and indent-decrease macros. Added
    indent increase and decrease to format, changed notes binding to f8,
    move shell tools from tools to advanced and setup commands into
    tools.
  - [060726] Fixed setting of scheme when session file does not exist
   (problem hit when old user uses session for first time)
  - [060725] Changed goto commands to not stop the show-region highlight
  - [060725] Major rearrangement of the main menu, replaced the Insert
    and Execute sub-menus with a View and Advanced, re-balanced and
    relocated many items, most notably the setup dialogs out of Help
    into Advanced.
  - [060725] Renamed the existing tool-bar macro to toolbar-open
    (mirrors existing toolbar-close) and introduced a new tool-bar macro
    that toggles state, i.e. closes if opened. This command is more
    useful in key-bindings and menus etc.
  - [060725] Improved error handling of osd based find tag, also adding
    support for tags file being in a parent directory.
  - [060725] Removed command-line validation and relax file selection
    requirement so user can create a tool that does not require a file
    name (e.g. open . in explorer)
  - [060725] Used set/goto-position to store current dot and added \<no favorites\> entry if menu is empty.
  - [060725] Added hot-keys to the file attrib dialog
  - [060725] Changed simply fence matching of quotes and double quotes,
    if match is not found by the end or start of the line it's assumed
    to be a single and ignored.
  - [060725] Changed &mid so the 3rd argument (length) can be -ve to
    mean from the right (as per the &rig etc) - not sure why this was
    not done first time round.
  - [060624] Changed session support to handle both window and console
     environments. Changed startup to only initialize one scheme.
  - [060623] Added file-type-setup to the list of misc setups.
  - [060622] Changed buffer-setup to major-mode-setup, also changed
    buffer-help to major-mode-help etc and fixed comments. Left
    buffer-setup in buffstp as there will be a buffer-setup which really
    does setup up the current buffer. Change me.emf date to 20060606
  - [060620] Stopped session trying to change the frame for a console
    run.
  - [060619] Sessions. Stopped restore buffer's whose file does not
    exist and changed the order of frame size setting so on UNIX the
    depth of windows are maintained correctly
  - [060619] Notes. Fixed current buffer position reset problem caused
    by buffer being shown on hidden notes frame
  - [060619] Changed all ME setup macros to reload the /history registry
    before change the registry and writing it out as soon as the changes
    are accepted to reduce the likelihood of settings (like new alias
    paths) being lost. One except is when the setup is run from within
    user-setup in which case the registry is only read and written by
    user-setup, this could have some unwanted side effects. Added
    session-setup to the user-setup misc page.
  - [060619] Change to allow macros access to inactive buffers broke
    file and ipipe hooks which get executed but the buffer is officially
    made active - fixed by maintaining the BIFNACT internal flag and
    ensuring the algorithm used for inactive buffers is only used wh ere
    appropriate. Found buffer context was not set correctly for session
    buffers whose name was set to 'name\<1\>' as the BIFNAME flag is not
    set, fixed by removing this flag and using code to assess if the \<1\>
    should be removed based on the filename.
  - [060619] Fixed read-registry's replace mode which was doing a merge
    as the old node was not removed.
  - [060619] Fixed a bad prompt and added a couple of brackets to
    protect compare order.
  - [060616] Changed the start-up process to not use the history
    commands (which have been removed) but simply use the read-registry
    commands.
  - [060615] Moved the storage of all history type info into the new
    session (esf) files.
  - [060615] $user-name.erf only contains setup info and not often
    edited changed user setup to minimize the likelihood of losing edits
    (at last).
  - [060615] Broken session-setup out into its own macro file and made
    quite a few fixes to the new session support.
  - [060615] Removed the save- and read-history commands the me.emf
    start-up now simply use the read-registry command
  - [060615] Changed find-buffer to allow limited access to inactive
    buffers (allows base getting and setting of variables)
  - [060615] Changed the exit-emacs numeric argument (again) so it can
    be used by meDie (0x28 exit-emacs ~= emergency exit)
  - [060615] Created new $window-mark-line & $window-mark-col to aid
    inactive buffer support (not sure why these were not already there
    as they are usefully in macros)
  - [060615] Enabled availability of save-some-buffers by default
    (quick-exit relies on this!)
  - [060615] Changed the -c command-line option to simply set the
    variable %session-name (relies on session macros)
  - [060615] Changed clipboard support to not mess with it during
    start-up and shut-down
  - [060615] Created new change-scheme command.
  - [060615] ClearCase. Fixed *cc-state* buffer not being in view mode
    when command completes.
  - [060615] Corrected types of exchange-point-and-mark.
  - [060608] Improved OSD search dialog by making the buttons always
    enabled and reporting an error if search string is empty.
  - [060608] Made the existing hidden scheme macro a visible command
    which can be used to change the current color scheme. Set
    .scheme.current to the file name of the current scheme Saved the
    current scheme in a session so a user can create a session with its
    own different scheme.
  - [060526] Sessions. Changed to use new shut-down pseudo key.
  - [060526] Changed shut-down process to call the ehooks for the
    current buffer of all frames and changed the shut-down macro to a
    pseudo key-binding.
  - [060525] Added a new buffer-major-mode command to change the current
    buffer's hook, giving it an arg of -1 or major mode of "" removes
    the hook. No completion list yet. Fixed tab-width setting so all 3
    windows get the same new value.
  - [060525] Changed gdiff to insert the 2 files into temp buffers so if
    the files are already loaded by the user these buffers are not
    effected. Added the ability to set the tab width.
  - [060525] Fixed crash caused by watch refreshing the buffer while
    user is using isearch - stopped watch from refreshing the buffer.
  - [060525] Added a new bit 0x10 to find- read- and view-file to
    disable the context fhook evaluation.
  - [060525] UNIX fix. Call screenUpdate directly after a window resize
    fixes gdiff update problem.
  - [060523] Sessions. First serious rev of session-load and -save.
  - [060523] Added arg to tool-bar to allow the tool-bar to be
    initialized without re-reading the registry - required by new
    session support.
  - [060523] Changed left click on mode line to change to the window if
    the mouse is not moved.
  - [060523] Fixed C++ '::\<function\>() ;' indentation bug introduced
    with c++ initialize ': \<base-init\> ()' indentation support.
  - [060523] Encrypted files. Added file/host to the password prompt so
    on a -c the user should know which password is required.
  - [060523] Fixed UNIX compiler warnings
  - [060516] me.emf. Fixed missing def of file-type-setup &
    shell-tool-setup.
  - [060515] Added new bit 0x2 to arg for change-buffer-name which force
    the buffer to have the given name, changing the name of an existing
    buffer if required.
  - [060512] ClearCase. Fixed cc-setup view deletion, pressing No does
    not remove it. Removed the temporary file created by cc-diff if me's
    diff of gdiff are used, file is still left if xdiff is used.
  - [060512] Added a new $mode-chars variable which returns the letter
    ids of all modes as a string, this variable cannot currently be set.
  - [060512] Changed the numeric arguments for quick-exit and
    save-buffers-exit-emacs to make them simple to use.
  - [060510] Improved the ftp logging so errors get put into the console
    with error numbers rather than just mlwrite'd. Removed the KEEPALIVE
    as ME closes the sockets with 10mins anyway. Fix the ftp kb/s calc.
  - [060510] Dirlist. Fixed context menu so the FTP additions are added
    for any ftp:// listing.
  - [060504] Major addition to notes: a) Added forw/back note. b) added
    notes-instant and notes-context c) implemented notes-session-save
    (not done window layout yet) but not implemented the matching load
    yet. d) fixed a few annoying up-date and behavior problems.
  - [060504] ClearCase. Fixed windows \\r\\n issue with diff -
    constructed predecessor could have the wrong format breaking the
    diff.
  - [060504] Changed reyank numeric arg so if a -ve arg is given reyank
    will fail if at the end of the kill chain rather than loop -
    required for notes-session-save
  - [060504] Found differences between copy and kill-region's handling
    of narrows, particularly if there's no markup line Found I could
    crash ME if only the end part of a narrow-to is killed - buffer line
    number all go wrong. To fix the issues I've created a standard
    function to handle the expansion of narrows over a region and made
    the rule that for a narrow without a markup line to be included in
    the region at least the \\n of the previous line and 1 char of the
    container line must be included, this means that narrows at the top
    and bottom cannot be included.
  - [060504] ClearCase. Fixed cc-merge comment bug.
  - [060504] Added support for a .ascii-time.format variable which
    defines the format for the output using '%' tags as per strftime
    function (supports most tags) - output is unchanged if variable is
    not set. Fixes request by Dick Pierce. Changed the OSD insert time
    function to use the same tokens and made the first format in the
    list be the output of ascii-time.
  - [060503] Provided macro interface to get a list of alpha marks for
    the current buffer.
  - [060427] Fixed context-menu element activation issue caused by
    selected file count being wrong.
  - [060427] Fixed notes and gdiff window resize issues by locking the
    size.
  - [060426] Improved (but not quite fully fixed and I don't think I
    can) the mouse word selection when the word is half hidden at the
    left or right edge of the window.
  - [060425] Fixed bug with setting $window-line, if value is \< 1 then
    the goto-line function prompts the user, this is incorrect behavior
    for a set variable command and the cause of a mouse driver spin.
    Fixed mouse left button spin caused by missing the pick event and a
    bug in set-variable for $window-line. Added new horizontal scroll
    feature when user clicks on a $window-char truncated line char.
  - [060421] JSP. Fixed java \<%...%\> within JavaScript start token
  - [060421] Fixed C++ comment hilighting
  - [060413] Added an abort-command safty trap to reset the
    $buffer-input variable.
  - [060413] JSP. Fixed most JSP hilight and indent issues caused by
    java and javascript confusions.
  - [060412] Bug fix. Put checks in to ensure the hilight/indent to be
    used according to a look-back scheme has been defined - fixes crash
    when viewing JSP files.
  - [060403] DIRECTORY LISTING. Fixed 'not-exist' fix in last commit -
    ftp dir lists can be only a couple of lines Made file/dir copy
    automatically try 3 times before prompting the user (large ftp
    copies will fail at points). Fixed browse mode close problem when
    browse deletes the buffer.
  - [060402] Used an ehook and a callback to auto detect a change in the
    notes frame buffer/window layout, if there is a change the callback
    closes the notes frame. This approach resolves many issues.
  - [060331] Fixed XML magic hook.
  - [060331] Fix annoying find-zfile last buffer history change. Changed
    the buffer & file name of a loaded zfile file to something more
    useful.
  - [060331] Created a '2 find-buffer \<file-name\>' arg which finds an
    existing buffer via its file name - used to fix annoying find-zfile
    buffer history change.
  - [060330] Fixed CVS & CC context menu placement issues. Fixed cc-add
    to use -mkpath for directories
  - [060330] Change fhook-dir to always detect if its a
    source-controlled dir and call the SC hook, the SC hook can then add
    its own bindings etc. Fixed fhook-dir so loading of ".../not-exist/"
    does not error.
  - [060330] Made the esc = & esc + menu bindings global.
  - [060329] Changed unix start-up mode to favor X over termcap if
    DISPLAY is set, even if term is a vt100.
  - [060329] Fixed mode-line udate bug when all edits are undone -
    reported by Tom Hundt.
  - [060322] Fixed the position of the context menu when opened by mouse
    or menu key. Fixed auto-spell not being available when context menu
    is opened using the menu key.
  - [060322] Improved gdiff-next command to error at the end of the file
    so the use knows they have reached the end. Bound 'menu' to open the
    contex menu and bound 'esc up' & 'esc down' to move between
    unassigned sections.
  - [060322] Bound f10 to close the notes frame and bound C-x k to a new
    notes-delete command
  - [060317] ClearCase. Added new cc-merge command (which uses
    cleartool's findmerge command!). Added new cc-describe command
    (which uses cleartool's describe command), fixed the CC context
    menu.
  - [060317] Directory listing. Increased 2Gb directory file size limit
    to 4Gb by making size variables meUInt.
  - [060317] Fixed '\\' quoting in command-wait example.
  - [060316] Up-dated docs for command-wait, added some meaty examples
    and added cross references to them.
  - [060316] indent fix
  - [060316] Changed describe-word osd dialog so that it has a 'Look Up'
    button which is the default. Also improved the insert description
    process so C-w kills the description inserted.
  - [060316] Improved the behaviour of the enter key in the help osd so
    it does a search or nothing.
  - [060315] Fixed a win32 console crash caused by the new frame
    reposition function. Stopped the messing about of the windows
    console when ME is in piped mode.
  - [060309] Fixed regex \\a -> \\g for bell and added support for \\a &
    \\m to [...] character classes.
  - [060309] Updated *shell-command docs.
  - [060309] Documented &lef, &mid & &rig -ve 2nd arg usage.
  - [060309] Documented insert-string's -ve arg.
  - [060309] Up-dated goto-matching-fence docs
  - [060309] Fixed docs for when no arg is given to forward-kill-word.
  - [060309] Updated jst template to new version. Fixed a couple of bugs
    with tables (empty cells and bad indent) Implemented a table cell
    '!' flag to indicate a start of a row (helps debugging) Fixed bug
    when title variable not set.
  - [060309] ClearCase. Minor improvement to setup layout
  - [060222] Exit handling fixed, saving of modified buffers, history,
    spell dictionaries etc. "**Emergency Exit**" messages removed from
    exit handling.
  - [060214] Corrected user setup mouse defaults - missing wheel mouse
    default bindings.
  - [060214] Improved the php look-back scheme to identify php script
    quicker.
  - [060213] Fixed crash caused by the new hilight look back scheme
    using the indent look back function which used the indent scheme
    rather than the hilight scheme
  - [060210] Improved php hilighting by making use of the new
    look-back-scheme and look-back-only-token features.
  - [060210] Improved the time printout
  - [060210] Benchmark tests. Improved the disptest.
  - [060210] ClearCase. Fixed cc-add when adding just a directory.
  - [060210] Added basic mouse support to browser and honours exit
    bindings
  - [060210] Added look-back-scheme support to hilighting (uses same
    code as indents quick-lookback scheme). Added new 'only use during
    look-back' hilight token (combined 0x800 & 0x200) which can solve
    make multi-line string hilighting issues.
  - [060210] Fixed compiler warning with -m changes
  - [060210] Removed unused variable in new reposition function
  - [060210] Fixed unused variable on NDEBUG build
  - [060209] Made changes to the -m server message option to make it
    usable. a) Process the message using the macro 'token' function so
    \\n is translated to a new-line char. b) If the message is not
    terminated with a \\n then one is added. c) The popup-window message
    it only given when -o option is used
  - [060209] Added support for a server 'M' message command.
  - [060209] Changed the hilight and indent meHilight structure mis-uses
    access the data via #define (added to estruct.h) so the code is
    clean and easy to read and the miss uses can be easily found and
    changed. Changed the storage of the main indent and hilight scheme
    flags to use the ignore field (only 5 bits currently used) so the
    trunc scheme can use the type and the hilight look back can use the
    close (i.e. unlimited).
  - [060209] Fixed clear-case update list on checkin option.
  - [060208] Fixed crash caused by mlGetStringFromUser being called
    recursively - only possible since the introduction of ftp completion
    which can prompt for the user password while inputting a file name.
  - [060207] Added an implementation of meFrameRepositionWindow for
    XTerm, not a very good one as there is not a clear standard between
    WMs.
  - [060207] Fixed obscure crash caused by horizonal scroll mode 2 and
    long lines.
  - [060202] Build script. Fixed MS-Window's typo.
  - [060201] ClearCase + CVS. Fixed hiding of *??-console* buffer and
    closing the window with loading a file from a dir list.
  - [060127] Broke the user-setup 'Tools' 'File Types' and 'EMail' pages
    out into separate independent setup dialogs. Added new Miscellaneous
    page to user-setup with links to these and other setup dialogs (such
    as alias-path and file-tool) Changed the buttons to the more
    standard Okay, Apply Cancel. Slightly changed some of the Mail & VM
    registry settings to make each platform independent (except
    filtering).
  - [060127] ClearCase. Added new cc-delete and alias-path-setup
    commands. Added f4 to diff binding. Moved the window resizing call
    to nearer the end (after the font resize as this could change to a
    smaller font allowing more lines etc).
  - [060127] Fixed quite a few issues with the CVS and clear-case UI
    interfaces. Brought cvs-state into line with CC, implemented
    cc-delete and rationalised the hot-keys and context menus.
  - [060127] Added new alias-path-setup OSD gui.
  - [060127] Added new 3 and 4 arg to popup-window to manipulate the
    main frame window, implemented meFrameRepositionWindow function on
    windows.
  - [060127] Fixed find-reg index in error message.
  - [060127] Moved macro parser's \\a to \\g (bell) and added support
    for \\a - alpha and \\m - alpha-num to hilight and regex.
  - [060125] Changed the default debug for 'deb' abbrev to 2.
  - [060125] Improved the hilighting of html &???; chars - issue raised
    by Tom Hundt
  - [060124] Fixed crash caused by moving right (cursor key) into a
    sub-menu with no active items - bug found by Tom Hundt.
  - [060122] gdiff. Fixed the bugs introduced with the 3rd 'current
    line' window was introduced.
  - [060122] Changed call from saveExitEmacs to exitEmacs to avoid
    compile errors for NE.
  - [060122] Fixed the meDie function to not exit straight after the
    emergency exit message, now autosaves as it should. Change the
    handling of the CLOSE message on windows so it prompts okay/cancel
    if buffers need saving and then exits. Fixed really annoying
    modifier state mismatch problem on windows - reproduce by pressing
    control right-click on title bar to get the system menu and then
    release the control, ME misses the C-drop event so thinks its still
    pressed.
  - [051220] JST extensions.
  - [051219] JST. Added implementation of TOC to html export.
  - [051219] ClearCase. Disable check out of parent dir for cc-add as
    its not implemented
  - [051215] JST. Changed tag highlighting to handle split line tags
    correctly. Implemented support for f and b color export to HTML
    using style.
  - [051215] First commit of new v4 JST format hook and export macros.
  - [051215] Fixed the return value of transpose-lines command which was
    always returning false causing cc-add to fail.
  - [051212] SQL Template. Missing hilight statement causes execution to
    fail - Thanks to Th.
  - [051212] Fixes to old JST before it gets trashed
  - [051125] Fixed regex bug where "[\\s]" incorrectly matches an 's'
  - [051125] ClearCase. Added support for not loaded to cc-state
  - [051123] Added support for alias-paths.
  - [051122] Fixed highlight problems with "^ *$" & "^\\\\s*$" close
    bracket tags, they should match any line containing only
    spaces/white-spaces but they did not work reliably.
  - [051122] ClearCase. Fixed the cc-diff, external diff settings had
    got muddled.
  - [051122] Directory listing. Changed the size ordering to list
    largest first on initial sort.
  - [051118] ClearCase. Implemented the auto get checkout comment and
    removed the temp command-line buffer.
  - [051118] Directory listing window. Added binding of 'f' to toggle
    the filter and changed the 's' and 'S' bindings round (s is far more
    useful)
  - [051118] Improved the horizontal scrolling of gdiff and browse
  - [051110] Make debugger stop at executed !elif & !else will work for
    all macros, may not work when executing a buffer as the line may
    start with a white space.
  - [051110] Stopped osd check-box macros from triggering the debugger
    when $debug is set to 1.
  - [051110] Added some more key translations based on bug report by
    Francesco Abbate.
  - [051104] 2nd and much improved version of cc-setup. Changed to using
    -1 insert-string to allow multi-line comments. Fixed horrid problem
    with cleartool's handling of checking out a file when its been
    hijacked, no command-line option to make it use the hijacked file me
    has to use ipipe-write a send 'yes' at the prompt, but as the prompt
    is not given me must be preempt and send them first, one for each
    file - clear-case is pants and cleartool sucks.
  - [051104] Changed cmd-line construction to use -1 insert-string to
    insert \\n's into the line - not really very nice.
  - [051104] Fixed meGetChar to be like GetString in that if running a
    macro the value has not been given it goes directly to the user
    rather than simply failing, this improves macro reliability and
    eases debugging of macros.
  - [051104] Multi-line shell fix. The new 0x100 flag to shell-command
    has one drawback, you cannot run commands that include newline
    characters as the cmd-line must be on the first line. But CVS and
    clear-case commit comments are often multi-line so this is not
    acceptable. To fix the problem I have added a -ve arg to
    insert-string comment which then performs a literal insertion, i.e.
    every char including a \\n char is inserted are text. This fixes the
    immediate problem but inserting a \\n char in a line can break other
    thing in a very major way (like undo) so it must be used with
    extreme care.
  - [051103] ClearCase. First rev of a CC tool defaults setup in
    cc-setup. Moved CC over to using 0x100 bit in shell-command to
    remove command-line length limit.
  - [051102] Moved multiple-file file-tool executions over to using the
    new 0x100 shell-command flag (first line of buffer) to remove
    command-line length limit in almost all cases (cmd has a 4kb limit)
  - [051102] Introduced a new 0x100 bit for shell commands which means
    the 'cmd-line' given is a buffer names whose first line holds the
    command-line to run.
  - [051028] ClearCase. Fixed cc-diff abort when a file has no
    differences. Added a 'delete line' function to cc-state bound to
    C-k.
  - [051019] Visual basic highlighting - added And Or and Xor operators.
  - [051013] Unix shell window, corrected highlighting of backslash
    escape character outside of a string enclosure.
  - [051011] ClearCase extensions. Added button to cc-checkin to get
    checkout comment. In cc-state - fixed file selection on last empty
    line and mouse selection and added support for mouse drag selection.
  - [051011] Changed dirlist copy/move to preserve the original files
    time stamp.
  - [051011] Fixed windows rename to check the to name is case
    insensitively different.
  - [051011] Implemented file time-stamp preservation in the file-op
    copy and move.
  - [051011] Improved the window-popup on windows, more likely to work
    but can still fail.
  - [051011] Fixed UNIX drag-n-drop, broken by -l l:c addition.
  - [051007] Integrated Ric Yeates command line __-l \<line\>:\<col\>__
    submission - thanks for the submission.
  - [051007] ClearCase. Removed VOB option from __cc-state__ as it did not
    work. Made __cc-console__ read only and better integrated including
    supporting it as a toolbar tool (like cvs-console).
  - [051007] Fixed bad variable assignment in directory list macros.
  - [051001] Corrected Sun Solaris x86 makefile to use the Sun Native
    compiler.
  - [050930] ClearCase. Fixed __cc-state__ to check the state of selected
    directories, which requires a double cleartool call (horrid
    command-line) Added support for config-spec viewing and editing.
    Added directory refresh option for checkin/out add etc. Added many
    improvements to cc-state buffer support, hilighting, file listing
    style sorting and selection (i.e. following are bound
    `1`,`2`,`3`,`+`,`-`,`u`,`a`,`*`)
  - [050930] __file-tool__, changed the buffer list toolbar tool to keep the
    current line to the current buffer when using __find-buffer__ etc.
  - [050930] Latest _Mirkwood_ update from Bruno.
  - [050930] Fixed ftp drag'n'drop copy bug, the source dir needed an
    file: prefix to remove the `ftp://` of the current buffer. While test
    I blew away my home directory, nasty way to discover that ftp can
    return `".."` not `"../"` and `".."` is not ignored when deleting! Fixed.
  - [050929] File listing, stopped copy, move etc commands from
    accepting `'../'` when its the current line Fixed `'v'` browse file open
    and close.
  - [050928] browse, removed the delete buffer flag from browse - wrong
    way to do this.
  - [050928] ClearCase, make __cc-annotate__ work if file is checked out
    (cleartool command-line is awful, why do you have to pay money to
    use this rubbish?)
  - [050928] Added wrap feature to __browse__ mode.
  - [050928] Changed _Mirkwood_ main OSD scheme to make current focus item
    more visible.
  - [050920] Changed the $debug variable to be bit based as its old
    values just could implement the required functionality.
  - [050920] Latest _Mirkwood_ highlight scheme - added underlining for
    spelling errors
  - [050920] OAD, added a comment tab to the scheme editor and up-graded
    the scheme selectors to use combo-boxes.
  - [050920] Fixed compile error on macos caused by bad macro
    definition.
  - [050919] Fixed 2 bugs: meRegHead's force could be left set to 1
    which has the side effect of `C-g` not hiding the active region. Due
    to last change to __command-wait__ the screen is not up-dated before
    waiting for a key breaking __gdiff__.
  - [050919] Readability update to _Mirkwood_ highlight scheme.
  - [050919] Changed ClearCase __cc-state__ to handle file names with '`[`'s
    in them.
  - [050915] Added Up, Down, Hide window and default open options to the
    __file-tool__ setup GUI. Added support for a default open to the
    directory listing, pressing return now checks for a __file-tool__
    default open (explorerish), '`o`' for open always loads the file into
    me.
  - [050915] Added support for dbx on sunos. Changed the ipipe input
    mode to be toggled using `f3` rather than set via `f2`, `f3` or `f4`.
  - [050915] __zfile__, fixed filename -> absolute file name when given as
    an macro arg - should be based off current buffer's path.
  - [050908] Added __file-tool__.
  - [050908] ClearCase, fixed `%diff-com` definition problem and
    __cc-uncheckout__ buffer update problem. Fixed __cc-checkout__ and
    __cc-checkin__ buffer update problems as well.
  - [050908] Improved the diff highlight, more readable and correct.
  - [050908] Added new _Mirkwood_ highlight scheme.
  - [050806] Added better support for MinGW. Fixed the console color bug
    and most of the compiler warnings. Added support for the MSYS shell
    by creating a unix style `mingw.gmk` (uses rm instead of del etc)
    updating the old `mingw.gmk` and renamed to `mingw32.gmk` and added
    support to the unix build script.
  - [050803] Fixed __ne__ crash when an unbound key is pressed, bug
    introduced with last commits.
  - [050721] Fixed annoying mouse refocus in osd dialog even though
    mouse is not moved - another windows nasty.
  - [050720] File browser, added directory closing binding to '`c`' and
    '`+`' '`-`' windows compatible bindings.
  - [050720] Pop-up menus, shifted the context menu down one line when
   opened by a key.
  - [050720] Directory listing. Changed the tag file list macro to
    support moving to the closest selected so the user can see which
    files they are deleting! Improved the file-tool so `\\H` will see a
    hot-key, '`\\`' chars and '`"`' must be quoted (i.e. '`\\\\`' & '`\"`')
    Bound '`t`' to open the file tool menu directly so tools can be easily
    executed without use of the mouse.
  - [050720] Source code reorganisation. Standardized the # preprocess
    forms, removed 2 uses of #elif and cplusplus and changed odd
    '`defined(_BSD)`' style bracketing which the __c-hash-eval__ does not
    handle.
  - [050720] Removed unused functionality from NE. Made the following
    available as extended functionality: __backward-delete-tab__,
    __change-buffer-name__, __change-file-name__, __define-macro-file__,
    __delete-blank-lines__, __delete-some-buffers__, __named-buffer-mode__,
    __save-some-buffers__, __save-buffers-exit-emacs__, user(`%`), buffer(`:`) and
    command(`.`) variables, __$buffer-input__, __$kept-versions__, __$mouse*__.
    __$pause-time__, __$MEBACKUPPATH__. Removed __-c__ from ne's help page as this
    is not supported. Moved macro regex __&xseq__, __&xrep__ based directives
    and most __@__ variables to extended functionality.
  - [050719] Organiser address search broken due to recent changes to
    macro argument getting. Fixed by changing the numeric argument which
    was ambiguously defined.
  - [050718] Source code reorganisation. Made the file hook variables
    and HideBuffer function statics. Changed ne to use fixed char groups
    for isUpper etc rather than the large look-up tables as it does not
    have __set-char-mask__ to configure them anyway.
  - [050718] C template. Fixed and greatly simplified the #if handling
    in the hash eval code. Added support for `#undef`.
  - [050715] Source code organisation. Removed unused code when there's
    no ipipe support. Hashed out location functions which are only
    required by socket or ipipe support.
  - [050714] Combined __cc-log__ and __cc-annotate__ into a single __cc-annotate__
    cammon with GUI. Added __cc-vtree__ and __cc-explorer__.
  - [050714] Fixed __user-setup__ setting of number of backups and Ignore
    files settings.
  - [050714] Fixed __file-op__ copy so the source file's attributes are
    preserved (i.e. remains read only etc). Implemented the 4th
    parameter (attribs) in __&stat i__ Implemented a __file-op__ chmod using arg
    bit `0x200`.
  - [050712] Corrected NE build under Windows, console build including
    windows calls.
  - [050712] Directory listing, fixed delete copy and move prompts, flag
    `0x08` got changed to `0x04` in __file-op__.
  - [050712] Implemented a proper ClearCase context diff by recreating
    the old file from the diff and then calling a real diff program.
  - [050712] Changed the diff hilighting to be just one scheme as a CC
    diff could contain a gdiff style for files and diff style for
    directories.
  - [050712] Corrected NE build problem with macro debugging.
  - [050711] Corrected Latex template load error in `hklatex.emf`
    (detected with `$debug=1`).
  - [050710] Fixed old `$debug` interface, found a long forgotton mode 3
    (now 4) which simply prints the current line without waiting, this
    broken the new mode 3.
  - [050709] Removed the __-d__ command line option - pointless.
  - [050709] Improved the macro command argument handling to get missing
    arguments from the user, i.e. having a macro line of: __fine-file__
    Works okay.
  - [050709] Vastly improved the macro debugging, the __$debug__ value of 1
    is now 2, 2 -> 3, a value of 1 now tells the user of any unhandled
    failures.
  - [050709] Fixed the Windows window resizing behaviour to be a lot
    more usable. The window size now increases in character size steps
    rather than bouncing around and the window is refresh as its
    changed. The Horizontal width limit of the window has effectively
    been removed (set to 400 chars) the depth is still restricted to the
    screen size, issue raised by Tom Hundt.
  - [050709] Added new file tools interface, creating windows explorer
    type file name based tools (e.g. extracting a zip file).
  - [050709] Added ClearCase __cc-log__ and __cc-annotate__ (similar to cvs's
    commands)
  - [050709] Stopped the default file hook from creating a bogus tool
    menu and help page.
  - [050709] Fixed the previous-line macro and the kill-word key
    bindings.
  - [050709] Changed the menu items which open a sub dialog to having
    '`...`' in their name as per the gui standard, issue raised by Tom
    Hundt.
  - [050708] Changed sub-menu display chars, auto open menus are now '
    `>`' and manual are '`+`', issue raised by Tom Hundt.
  - [050708] Got thoroughly fed up with the emacs style __kill-word__ -
    useless. Came up with a compromise, if no numeric arg is given then
    it works the old way, if an argument is given (i.e. 1, 2 ...) it
    works in like emacs (which makes sense as you are asking it to kill
    1 word etc.)
  - [050708] Changed __list-commands__ and __command-apropros__ to not list
    hidden macros by default. They can be listed if bit 1 of the numeric
    argument is clear (aka __list-buffers__)
  - [050625] Updated mode line letter mnemonics which were out of date,
    issue raised by Tom Hundt.
  - [050625] Stop me crashing when describe-variable is given something
    like "__&or__", now restricted to variables of type `#`, `$`, `%`, `:`, `.` only.
  - [050618] Added support for -ve offests to __&lef__, __&mid__, __&rig__ functions
    to go from the end of the string.
  - [050618] Created a _no wait_ option to __shell-command__ so processes can
    be launched and forgotten about. Also added support for all the
    other process launch flags present in pipe and ipipe shell commands.
    Removed some very dead code.
  - [050618] Avoided a '__&mid -1__' in display matching fence (`dmf.emf`) by
    restructuring the logic a bit.
  - [050616] Revision 3 of ClearCase support.
  - [050614] Second rev of clearcase support. restructured the execution
    of cleartool so ipipes are used (even though the user may not be
    able to edit) giving feedback on progress. Implemented a basic diff
    which can only diff one file at a time and only with its predecessor
    but at least it supports a context output of sorts!
  - [050614] Fixed __command-wait__ when no arg is given to return when a
    callback sets the `.wait` variable. Command now returns imediately if
    the `.wait` variable is not defined. Fixed windows sleep function
    which was managing to break out before it should.
  - [050612] latex added macros for bold/italic/mono character
    formatting.
  - [050612] nroff region support for character formating.
  - [050612] __.fhook-xxx.command-n__ syntax added to __buffer-init__ to
    simplify comamnd definition.
  - [050610] Removed "__C-c C-g__" key binding in document macros and
    replaced with "__C-c \<__" because of __C-g__ issue.
  - [050610] CVS added support for a __cvsco.etf__ checkin template.
  - [050610] First revision of ClearCase support, very incomplete and
    primative but the hooks required in the rest of the system are in
    place.
  - [050609] Changed the directory listing so '`.`' is removed and `..` is
    always the first _file_ and cannot be selected. Fixed some directory
    display annoying refresh issues.
  - [050609] First implementation of directory deletion, copying and
    moving, including support for ftp directories etc. Areas of concern
    are still copied file's permissions and to a lesser degree
    ownership. Also the copies behaviour with symbolic links, this must
    be tested further.
  - [050609] Fixed file permissions and ftp minor issues a couple of
    major ftp bugs and __$file-names__ working for ftp directories.
  - [050609] Added new __&stat__ "`i`" flag and argument bit 4 to __file-op__ to
    abort on a problem rather than prompt, it also returns an error code
    in _$result_.
  - [050609] Changed the kill word commands so have the same word
    boundary behaviour as __forward-word__ and Emacs (was killing word only
    then whitespaces only etc). Corrected word movement and killing
    command's EOB and BOB error handling.
  - [050608] Added new __rdiff__ (recursive diff) command
  - [050608] Updated __string-rectangle__ and __space-rectangle__ to improve its
    usability.
  - [050608] Updated __describe-word__ setup comment.
  - [050601] Corrected `ne.emf`, broke Window mode in disabling console
    mode for __ne -R__ option change.
  - [050601] Corrected crash on hilight with alpha-numerics of form
   `[[:digit:]]` when spelt incorrectly.

  __8th Release - May 2005__
 
  Release date specified as 2005/05/05.

  - [050508] JASSPA MicroEmacs 8th release - final. Core and macro
    versions 20050505.
  - [050514] Fixed ftp copy lock-up (most noticable on windows) caused
    by the response read at the start of a command also reading (and
    disgarding) the finishing message so ME hangs at the end of the
    command waiting for a response.
  - [050514] Enabled ipipes under cygwin by default.
  - [050514] Fixed win32s build.
  - [050514] Fixed __mecygwin__ interactive MS-DOS and cygwin BASH shells.
  - [050513] Found the UNIX __waitpid(-1,...)__ in the sigchild handler
    (which removes any zoombie processes) removes the pipe commands
    process so the pclose call cannot get the process's exit code
    (returns -1).
  - [050509] Changed the name of aix43 make files to aix4 and sunos 55
    and 56 files to a single sunos5 makefile
  - [050509] Added support for __aix v5__ (tested on aix v5.1)
  - [050507] Added Finnish support to ne.emf.
  - [050506] Improved python collapse and item-list support and added
    eaf and etf for python - thanks to Detlef.
  - [050505] Base version numbers reset for next release.
  - [050429] Added support for keybinding to item-list column ordering,
    function is item-list-order and is bound to 1, 2 and 3 by default.
    Thanks to Bryan Schofield for his submission in this area.
  - [050429] Spelling - protect '.'s in the word with \\.
  - [050428] Corrected TCL hilighting w.r.t. comment at end of line -
    submitted by Bryan Schofield.
  - [050427] Major reworking of main commands in a directory listing
    buffer. Implemented typical features found in an OFM standard
    browser and create standard bindings as well as termcap friendly
    ones. Changed delete binding to delete files rather than close
    browser which is now bound to f10.
  - [050427] osd - Added numeric bit 8 on osd-entry arg to put the text
    above the entry.
  - [050427] Added C-x k support to browser mode to kill the buffer,
    also added hook for the file-browser's view file.
  - [050427] Fixed user-setup to use only one value of $file-ignore &
    $kept-versions per platform rather than one for window and one for
    console based versions.
  - [050427] Shrunk the size of the file-attrib dialog to ensure it fits
    on a termcap screen.
  - [050427] Fixed nasty bug with transpose-line at the end of the
    buffer swapping the last line with the first!
  - [050427] main.c - Fixed minor compiler warnings.
  - [050426] Added a binding for file completion (any key bound to
    insert-tab) so OSD dialogs can do completion (although awkwardly).
  - [050423] Fixed wiki edit mode for Russian keyboards, the 'k' flag
    key mapping was breaking things.
  - [050423] Windows - Fixed windows Ctrl numeric pad keys, now come
    through as C-0 ... C-9 C-* C-+ etc.
  - [050420] Added new Dot/Neato support fhook (for .dot files) - thanks
    to Detlef for the submission.
  - [050420] TCL - Added more hilight tokens from Detlef.
  - [050420] Document macros - fixed cpp->tcl typo - thanks to Detlef
    for spotting this.
  - [050410] Fixed the -R option for DOS box, cursor same as the
    foreground color which is not ideal!
  - [050410] Fixed the SunOS x86 makefile to disabled #pragam warnings
    under GCC.
  - [050409] Release Candidate 2 - MicroEmacs 2005 (RC2)
  - [050408] Added flag to the user-setup Tools to force the rereading
    of the current buffer's file, thanks to Bryan Schofield.
  - [050408] Added new .item-list.width variable to allow control of the
    item window list - submitted by Bryan Schofield.
  - [050408] Moved the generate tags into the sub folder and added a
    compile option to c and cpp - submitted by Bryan Schofield.
  - [050405] Added support for DOS code page 866 (Cyrillic Russion) -
    submitted by Nicholas Kudriavtsev
  - [050331] Added support for the setting of the history in macros via
    @h#.
  - [050325] registry.c - removed compiler warning indicating porting
    problem hilighted under Darwin. Post increment of variable on left
    of assignment and same variable appeared on the right, split out the
    increment to reduce ambiguity of the statement.
  - [050320] UNIX only - add a rule for .dir files found in the X11
    directory. We do not want this files identified as "dir" info root
    file
  - [050320] Added termcap (white) scheme for reverse video operation.
  - [050320] Newuser registry file - added default entry for Apple Mac
    "darwin". Confirmed operation under Mac X-Windows.
  - [050320] Extended ME exit commands to support the discarding of
    modified buffers '`0x8 discard modified buffers`' and '0x10 discard
    modified buffers and create recovery file for changes'.
  - [050320] Corrected XML syntax for strings "`...`" to fix indent and
    hilight anomalies.
  - [050319] Added __-R__ command line option to reverse the built in video
    schemes - specifically for __ne__(1) also works with __me__(1).
  - [050319] Corrected default mode settings. Recent removal of
    __letter(2m)__, __line(2m)__ etc. changed the mode byte assignment of some
    modes. The built in global mode default was not updated for this
    change in bytes and incorrect global modes appeared as a result -
    specifically __quiet(2m)__ which has jumped bytes.
  - [050315] LEX/YACC template - Corrected LEX and YACC highlighting.
    Aligned C, C++ and YACC/LEX templates to be consistent.
  - [050315] C/C++ templates - buffer setup modified for GNU Indent
    Style setting.
  - [050315] Added new [browse(3)](browse(3)) command and binding to f3, changed
    existing collapse-all __f3__ binding to __C-f2__.
  - [050315] Modified ME exit commands to support a bitwise arg n where
    main [exit-emacs(2)](exit-emacs(2)) has '`0x01 Prompt`', '0x02 Save each buffer/reg/dic
    (with prompt if 0x01 set)' and '0x04 Prompt for exit code and exit
    ME with that code.'
  - [050313] Latex template - Corrected the latex-fill-paragraph. Set
    the fill-mode to '__l__' rather than '__L__' because its a pain when it
    selects centre rather than left and messes things up.
  - [050311] Directory list - changed column sorting so Modified is
    sorted most recent first.
  - [050311] Fixed perldb pipe operation.
  - [050310] OSD simplified the main context menu and moved paste a cvs
    items in the directory context menu
  - [050310] Fixed diff's file name input, was not completing correctly
  - [050310] CVS changed the default setting of the recursive add to
    off.
  - [050310] JASSPA MicroEmacs quick start document released.
  - [050309] Fixed bug in regex multi-line search backwards, searching
    for "`foo[^a]`" is a mult-line as `[^a]` matches `\\n`, if "`foob`" exists
    at the start of the line isearch-backward refuses to move on.
  - [050309] Catman pages added for ne(1) and me(1) complaints with
    gentoo as missing. Added to the package builds.
  - [050308] Fixed a nasty bug with ftp connect dialog when the host has
    a port. Changed the default path to be nothing which becomes `/~/` to
    list the login directory. Change the tab order to not include the
    password as tabbing through the entry will lose the password, must
    now access via mouse or hot key which is not ideal.
  - [050308] Added support for relative ftp browsing via new
    `ftp://???/~/???` url form. Added file name completion support for ftp
  - [050306] Corrected the docmacro` http://` regular expression.
  - [050306] Changed the date format of the __-V__ command line option to
    include the century, same format as the [about(2)](about(2)) buffer.
  - [050302] HTLP and PHP - fixed [indent(2)](indent(2)) problems.
  - [050302] Perl template - fixed indent problems caused by not
    skipping the `=~` type regular expressions.
  - [050302] TCL template - fixed continuation and comment indent bug.
  - [050302] Added support for R/S-plus (.r) files - thanks to Detlef.
  - [050225] HTML template - fixed an indent which was fixed at "`2`"
    rather than "`t`" and added comment skipping indent rules
  - [050225] [dos2unix(3f)](dos2unix(3f)), [unix2dos(3f)](unix2dos(3f)) and [unix2win(3f)](unix2win(3f)) - Removed use
    of __&spr__ in favor of __&cat__ so `dos2unix` etc. work in [ne(1)](ne(1)). [050225]
    Tracing a problem with hilighting a token of the form "`AB*$`", works
    if there is a '`B`' but fails if there are no '`B`'s, i.e. only matches
    "`AB+$`". Found that removing the end of line special case code fixes
    the problem. I believe the rest of the code has been improved to
    handle any end-of-line quirks - I hope so!
  - [050225] Removed the '`start-up`' macro function compile option so all
    versions support this - "`ne`" can now do a "`@dos2unix`"
  - [050225] Regular expressions - extended replacement string syntax.
    Added support for "`\c#`" "`\l#`" and "`\u#`" to change the case of
    groups, where "`\c#`" is capitalise, "`\l#`" is lower "`\u#`" is upper and
    "`#`" is the group number (`0-9`, `&`)
  - [050225] Regular expressions - changed syntax of "`\s?`" and "`\S?`" in
    favor of Perl's simpler "`\s`" and "`\S`" for a whitespace char class.
    Added new character classes "`\d`" = digits, "`\D`" != digits "`\h`" =
    hexdigits "`\H`" != hexdigits "`\l`" = lowercase "`\L`" != lowercase "`\u`"
    = uppercase and "`\U`" != uppercase. These changes were made to both
    the main regex search engine and the [hilight(2)](hilight(2)) token matching
    engine. Added support for char classes within the main regex `[...]`
    character class, i.e. now supports regexs like "`[\l\u_]`" for any
    lower, upper or '`_`' char. This is not supported in the hilight which
    currently has a more simplistic "`[...]`" char class support.
  - [050225] Regular expressions - changed use of "`\s `", "`\s-`", "`\S `"
    and "`\S-`" classes to simply "`\s`" and "`\S`" which is perl regex
    compliant (ditching Emacs "`\s`" syntax as it is cumbersome and not
    very useful). The only nasty side effect is hilight's miss-use of
    "`\S1`" - "`\S9`" to mean not "`\1`" - "`\9`" group char, changed to "`\!1`" -
    "`\!9`"
  - [050224] [ne(1)](ne(1)) set to not auto-save or create backups by default.
  - [050224] Added "`-a`" and "`-B`" command line options to enable and
    disable auto-save [auto(2m)](auto(2m)) and [backup(2m)](backup(2m)) modes.
  - [050224] Tcl template - some more fixes to the item list from Detlef
  - [050224] [watch(3)](watch(3)) improved the refresh rate of a type 2 or 3 watch
    by ignoring the `:watch-time` and just look at the `:watch-size`. Fixed
    the split line issue with type 2 of 3 watching caused by last line
    not being complete.
  - [050224] __M-x__ __ftp__ - stripped '`ftp://`' and any trailing '`/`' of the
    users entered host name as these break ftp. Improved the dialog's
    handling of passwords, the user can now tell if a password has been
    set.
  - [050224] Added standard binding for mark-function
  - [050224] Fixed the ME token hilighting in the C hook
  - [050224] Removed recently added `%no_backup` variable to disable
    backup create as new __-B__ option is a much better way of doing it.
  - [050224] `edef.h` - Removed definition of non-existant variable
  - [050224] Fixed failure when trying to load "`http://www.jasspa.com`",
    there is an implicit trailing '`/`' which MicroEmacs now adds.
  - [050224] Tcl template - major improvement - courtesy of Detlef.
  - [050224] Fixed __collapse__to support the file hooks .exact setting (set
    to -1 means case insensitive)
  - [050224] Added new __beginning-of-function__, __end-of-function__,
    __goto-function-line__ and __mark-function macros__ - thanks to Detlef.
  - [050223] Windows MS-dev 6 project - corrected project settings for
    `_URLSUPP` to `_SOCKET` in keeping with the socket dynamic library
    loading.
  - [050223] Added exec of wish to the tcl magic hook
  - [050223] Fixed [$window-chars(5)]($window-chars(5)) - added OSD default button chars.
  - [050222] Fixed [$user-path(5)]($user-path(5)) being more that 35 chars breaking 
    the [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) dialog.
  - [050222] Directory listing - call `fhook-html` when file is a` http://`
    file - this is never a directory listing.
  - [050222] Stopped loading of files in dir listing when clicking way
    to the right, must click on the name (MicroEmacs kept loading files
    when just trying to raise the window to the front - annoying).
  - [050222] If 0 given to [watch(3)](watch(3)) call watch-time, this preserves the
    old interface.
  - [050222] Added backup file disabling for [dos2unix(3f)](dos2unix(3f)) macros via
    command line defineable variable.
  - [050221] Changed the new Windows process tree killing to use
    `LoadLibrary()` to detect whether the OS supports this feature (and NT
    does not). Also moved the URL support over to `LoadLibrary()` so we
    can remove the __-u__ builds.
  - [050220] Added UNIX Shell and Makefile hilighting to [notes(3)](notes(3))).
  - [050219] Fixed GNU GCC warnings in Makefiles for #pragma in X11
    files under Sun Solaris and uninitialized variables.
  - [050219] [osd(2)](osd(2)). Removed dialog '`F`' flag as it was not documented,
    did not work and only used in one obscure place. Fixed __C-g__ and __Del__
    so they close up to the previous dialog but does close the main menu
    down in one call - was annoying.
  - [050219] Release Candidate 1 - MicroEmacs 2005 (RC1)
  - [050218] Corrected UNIX [client-server](Client-Server(2)) socket file check -- bad test
    on existence of connection file, using wrong variable with wrong
    test sense.
  - [050218] Added site delete button to __ftp-connect__ dialog.
  - [050218] Fixed abbreviation and exec-string "`\\p`" and "`\\P`" store
    and goto position problem when the `C-x` `C-a` or `C-x` a keys are
    rebound. Fixed by replacing with '__esc__ __x__ __set-alpha-mark__ __P__' (where
   __esc-x__ is a safe internal special key).
  - [050218] Updated [watch(3)](watch(3)) interface and made public. Created 
    new [watch-time(3)](watch-time(3)) command and prompt user for watch type when no
    argument is given.
  - [050218] Removed the use of bit `0x1000` in Ada string hilight as this
    is unlikely to be wanted (probably copied from Pascal).
  - [050218] Changed the registry parser to abort on error rather than
    trying to carry on (a very painful process for a badly decrypted
    registry file).
  - [050218] Fixed highlighting minor issues. [hilight(2)](hilight(2)) scheme now
    returns back to EOL scheme after a bracket. A branch tag on an EOL
    line removes the EOL flag so it hilights correctly. Branch tag now
    supports the `0x1000` single line hilight. Lookback now supports `0x800`
    on a branch tag.
  - [050217] HTML highlighting. Fixed some really grizzly scripted html
    page highlighting issues, predominantly with php.
  - [050217] Change ftp so it opens the __ftp-connect__ dialog if the
    current buffer is `*ftp-files*`.
  - [050217] Fixed ftp dir list column detection and highlighting issue
    with windows ftp servers (time given as `9:15` not `09:15`)
  - [050217] Fixed bug in [set-variable(2)](set-variable(2)) and [unset-variable(2)](unset-variable(2)) 
    when [&sprintf(4)](&sprintf(4)) is used to create a variable name.
  - [050217] Watch command (watch.emf). Improved the watch command, made
    '`0` `watch`' call __watch-reset__, changed __watch-reset__ so with an argument
    of `0` it removes all watches otherwise it resets the main watch
    counter and reports to the user which buffers are watched. Added new
    '`2` `watch`' and '`3 watch`' which compares the file size, doing the
    following: __a)__ file on disk is smaller than last watch - reloads
    whole file. __b)__ file size is the same - does nothing. __c)__ file on disk
    is larger - appends to the end of the buffer the tail of the file
    (`file_size` `-` `watch_file_size` bytes). This assumes that the files is
    always being appended (reasonable assumption in most cases. The only
    difference between 2 and 3 is that 2 forces a complete reread of the
    file on the first file change (ensuring the buffer is correct), 3
    does not which allows the user to trash the first gigabyte of the
    buffer before starting the watch.
  - [050217] Shell template - added local and function keywords and
    fixed a few string highlighting problems.
  - [050216] Made the dir-listing's (Filtered) label on line 2
    pick-able, changing the filter status when picked Made CVS's
    CVS-Quick label pick-able doing a full reread when picked.
  - [050216] Fixed a couple of silly register bugs introduced with
    last [find-registry(2)](find-registry(2)) concat root and sub-key change. Improved behavior
    when ftp erf file is missing, now create a new one in memory and
    flags as changed so should be saved on exit.
  - [050216] Do not abort `me.emf` execution if ftp erf file is missing or
    bad.
  - [050216] Fixed by removing the '`startup`' function, the main init now
    uses dofile directly and it checks for either a NULL or `""` as a
    filname and replaces with "__me__" or ("__ne__" and does not complain) if
    found to be empty. This means that give [execute-file(2)](execute-file(2)) an empty
    string executes either "__me__" or "__ne__", i.e. resets me - nice side
    effect. Changed '`dofile()`' to `execFile()` and changed `execFile()` to
    `executeFile()` (as is function for command __execute-file(2)__) and
    change the other exec command function names for consistency.
  - [050216] Fixed an annoyance reported by Bruno, ne should not
    complain if it fails to find `ne.emf` - fair enough.
  - [050215] Fixed crash caused by using `-c` option with all files hidden
    (comment when browsing ftp dirs as cache dir lists are hidden) The
    startup process knows the history created buffers but the
    replacement was none of these and due to the toolbar it was a buffer
    without a file name and bang! Fixed in 2 ways, first check the
    replacement has a file name, second do not put hidden files into the
    history - they're hidden.
  - [050210] Improved movement between items using the cursor in the
    search dialog.
  - [050210] Fixed cvs dialog default settings.
  - [050210] Corrected search path expansion, incorrectly handling a
    `PATH_CHAR` at the start of the string.
  - [050209] Up-dated [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) platform page to new style and
    added  [yank-rectangle(2)](yank-rectangle(2)) binding.
  - [050209] Fixed no-color termcap [$window-chars(5)]($window-chars(5)) variable setting
  - [050209] Fixed hot keys (were 3 'U's) in `osdmisc.emf`.
  - [050209] Added new _BraceStatement_ [indent(2)](indent(2)) value to support GNU C
    indentation style.
  - [050209] Fixed the `osdDisp()` function required a `TTflush()` otherwise
    the cursor is left in the wrong position on termcap systems.
  - [050209] Fixed the default [$window-chars(5)]($window-chars(5)) variable setting.
  - [050209] Fixed the DOS home directory setting and compiler warnings.
  - [050208] Changed the C indent definition to be the same format as
    the existing indent definitions i.e. uses flag & indent value, this
    makes it more flexible and extendible. Updated macro files.
  - [050205] Password generation macros added to `contrib` directory.
  - [050205] Added JavaDoc highlighting to Java template. Enablement
    via [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)). Removed the existing "`my`" extensions from contrib.
  - [050205] Added __Doxygen(1)__, _\<stdint.h\>_ and error highlighting to
    C/C++ templates. Enablement via [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)). Removed the
    existing "`my`" extensions from `contrib`.
  - [050204] osd - Fixed problems with the _cursor shows current item_
    feature of osd caused by the cursor position going outside of the
    window.
  - [050202] Added an initial item number to the favorite and buffer
    menus.
  - [050203] Standardized narrow anchor and line flag movement behaviors
    with respect to deleting and inserting text. Enforced to effectively
    exist at character column -1 and been strict about maintaining a
    protected line. Made undo cope with markup lines that are lost.
    These changes may be a little to severe - we'll see.
  - [050202] Fixed __C-g__ close osd dialog crash.
  - [050202] Directory listing - fixed nasty bug cause by the directory
    changing on disk before the hook has managed to do anything leading
    to a failure - this has been annoying Jon for some time!
  - [050127] `hkemf.emf` - Fixed `!until` indent rule.
  - [050127] First revision of __notes__.
  - [050127] Fixed positional problems with mouse rectangle regions and
    added a mouse rectangle yank to user-setup.
  - [050127] cvs - Set the initial osd dialog item to be the first item
    rather than the Okay button (with is still the default button).
  - [050127] Fixed `*scratch*` hook assignment issues, initial startup
   buffer and only buffer delete problem.
  - [050127] Added process tree killing for windows, tested on win98, 2k
    & XP, would be good to test on win95 (which should work) and NT
    which should not work but hopefully will be no worse than current
    version.
  - This is a process tree killing for ipipes, in win32 killing the
    process we create is simply not good enough, all child processes
    continue unaffected. For example, run compile, kill the buffer in
    mid compile and it carries on behind your back!
  - For Unix we use a new group and kill the group, DOS does not support
    ipipe. We could have used the new Job concept in ME but this is only
    present in win2000 & XP and the binaries are unlikely to run on
    win98 etc. This should run on every win32 platform although it is
    unlikely to do anything positive on an NT box (works in win2k)
  - [050126] Changed the location of the __fhook-default__ macro so its only
    defined if using __buffinit__ (i.e. if running main `me.emf`)
  - [050126] Fixed osd button repeat issue when current focus is an
    entry.
  - [050126] Changed __insert-file-name__ to insert buffer name if a -ve arg
    is given, bound to __C-x y__ on the mode line, this replaces ml-lines
    __esc__ __y__ feature.
  - [050123] Fixed a crash caused by too many closed fences, the
    recursive nature of the `findfence()` function triggers a stack crash
    at around 22000 on windows. Set limit to 256 nested fences.
  - [050122] Fixed [dir(2m)](dir(2m)) mode loss on a directory re-read, this caused
    a number of side effects including loss of highlighting and user
    prompt to reload the directory when it had changed.
  - [050119] Removed the "_sub-key_" argument from all registry related
    calls (see [&reg(4)](&reg(4)) and [set-registry(2)](set-registry(2))). The registry calls used to
    comprise two arguments "_root_" and "_sub-key_", the "_sub-key_" is really
    redundant and the same effect may be achieved by a simple string
    concatenation of the "_sub-key_" to the "_root_".
  - [050119] Added "`my-*hook-always`" macro checks in the buffer hook
    switching of [buffer-init(3)](buffer-init(3)) to permit global file hooks to be
    defined, this allows a file hook to operate on all buffers.
    "`my-*hook-always`" is executed after the language file hooks of
    "`*hook-XXX`" and "`my-*hook-XXX`".
  - [050116] Added "`TODO`" highlighting rule for Makefile comments.
  - [050114] Fixed [narrow-buffer(2)](narrow-buffer(2)) type numeric argument not processed
    correctly.
  - [050113] Added tool bar tool mouse select region command.
  - [050113] Added bindings for the cvs and ftp console tools.
  - [050113] Fixed [organizer(3)](organizer(3)) duplicate index bug.
  - [050111] Deleted the __get-registry(2)__ command, this has been
    depreciated and [&reg(4)](&reg(4)) should be used instead.
  - [050111] Extended the [read-registry(2)](read-registry(2)) and [save-registry(2)](save-registry(2)) commands
    to permit reading and writing from a buffer based registry (rather
    than file).
  - [050111] Extended [list-registry(2)](list-registry(2)) to permit listing of specific
    nodes, the output buffer of the registry listing may be specified.
    Added a invisible flag to a registry node which hides the node
    completely (but can be toggled).
  - [050111] Fixed windows server command file polling of up to 60 times
    a second by making the adder of the command responsible for 'waking'
    MicroEmacs by sending a `WM_USER` message. This is not a problem for
    UNIX as it is possible to wait on file input and `EOF` is not
    reported.
  - [050105] Fixed several narrow-to [narrow-buffer(2)](narrow-buffer(2)) usability issues,
    with these fixes the top and bottom narrow cannot be removed without
    a markup line and the order cannot get muddled.
  - [050105] Fixed a problem with the anchor position up-date when
    inserting a whole line.
  - [050105] Changed the osd entry mouse handling to always refocus,
    this allows the user to change location in the current entry using
    the mouse.
  - [050105] Fixed. [insert-macro(2)](insert-macro(2)) undo location was incorrect causing
    a crash.
  - [050103] Spelling dialog. Changed the Ignore button to Continue if
    word becomes correct without changing (word added or language
    changed).
  - [050103] Fixed. CVS osd dialog with bad hot-key.
  - [050102] Added setting of [$recent-keys(5)]($recent-keys(5)) variable.
  - [041231] Variable __$fmatchdelay(5)__ renamed to [$pause-time(5)]($pause-time(5)).
    _$pause-time_ is now used for other MicroEmacs delay times when the
    user is prompted for information.
  - [041224] Fixed several usability issues in the search replace
    dialog.
  - [041224] Up-graded printer-setup dialog to new style OSD.
  - [041224] CVS dialog - added read-only option to checkout and update.
  - [041224] Fixed [goto-line(2)](goto-line(2)) offset which as always going to the
    previous line (one out). __u__ [041221] Added support for proper kill
    buffer use in message line, i.e. [set-mark(2)](set-mark(2)), [kill-region(2)](kill-region(2)),
    and  [copy-region(2)](copy-region(2)), [yank(2)](yank(2)) and [reyank(2)](reyank(2)) all work in the same way as a
    normal buffer.
  - [041221] Fixed registry node deletion when the node is modified.
  - [041221] Removed [osd(2)](osd(2)) `osd 0` '_d_' flag and added '_I_' initial item
    and '_D_' default button flags, existing osd dialogs which use '_d_'
    will fail to load and need are migrated to use the _D_ and _I_ flags.
  - [041218] [auto-spell(3)](auto-spell(3)) key bindings are promoted to global so its
    easy to enable in any buffer.
  - [041218] Corrected setting of the [$home(5)]($home(5)) environment variable to
    handle MS-Windows '`\\`'s, auto terminate with '`/`'.
  - [041210] Added Enable/Disable Auto-Spell to the context menu.
  - [041210] Rearranged the [organizer(3)](organizer(3)) dialog to be a little easier to
    navigate through.
  - [041210] Fixed nedit emulation insert binding.
  - [041210] Removed __ml-clear(2)__ command, replaced with [ml-write(2)](ml-write(2))
    option "`0 ml-write`".
  - [041210] Removed the __change-directory(2)__ command, a change in
    directory is achieved by changing the [$buffer-fname(5)]($buffer-fname(5)) value such
    that the path defines the location of the command. All macros
    operated relative to the buffer location and never explicitly
    changed the directory location.
  - [041210] Fixed CUA emulation insert binding.
  - [041210] Deleted __letter(2m)__ mode. Use the default binding 
    of [forward-delete-char(2)](forward-delete-char(2)) for letter mode off, where single deleted
    characters are to be added to the kill buffer then the existing
    __letter(2m)__ mode may be achieved by binding as "1
    forward-delete-char". Similarly for backspace,
    is [backward-delete-char(2)](backward-delete-char(2)).
  - [041210] Deleted __line(2m)__ mode. Use a binding with [kill-line(2)](kill-line(2)) of
    "`1 kill-line`" to mimic the line mode enabled and "`kill-line`" for
    line mode disabled.
  - [041210] Deleted __cmode(2m)__. Electric-c is now configured 
    with [indent(2)](indent(2)). C and C++ indent styles can be different, can also have a
    GNU C style etc, can change the indent width as new indent rule
    supports '_t_', consistent [$buffer-indent(5)]($buffer-indent(5)) interface.
  - [041210] Created new osd file "`osdmisc.emf`" for miscellaneous OSD
    macros, this removes the OSD dependency when the MicroEmacs is
    executed in special start up modes with startup files. Moved search
    and new __indent-setup(3)__ commands out of "`search.emf`" and
    "`format.emf`" into a new "`osdmisc.emf`" as they cause problems with
    utils that do not run "`me.emf`" (e.g. "`ehftools.emf`")
  - [041210] Introduced a GNU emacs emulation mode, emulation file is
    "`meemacs.emf`".
  - [041209] Fixed __newuser__ "`$user-name.emf`" conflict issue with an
    existing macro (e.g. `zaurus.emf`) by testing for it and prefixing a
    digit to make the file unique.
  - [041209] Added `esc C-\` binding to [restyle-buffer(3)](restyle-buffer(3)).
  - [041209] Fixed some issues with the Tools user-setup dialog.
  - [041128] Added MinGW makefile posted to JASSPA group by Patrick
    Anderson, forms part of the release makefiles.
  - [041126] Added '`k`' keyboard setup to [set-char-mask(2)](set-char-mask(2)) which is used
    to translates foreign keys to a latin char.
  - [041126] Changed the internal LEADER byte to `0x1c` as `0xff` is a valid
    Russian char and it badly breaks _$vars_ and _macros_.
  - [041126] Fixed spell dump word which was not translating the words
    to the users char-set.
  - [041126] Added support for Russian language.
  - [041126] Improved the aff ispell conversion routines (almost works
    automatically).
  - [041126] Stopped [auto-spell(3)](auto-spell(3)) from triggering the no dictionaries
    error, leave it to [spell-buffer(3)](spell-buffer(3)) etc.
  - [041125] Fixed OSD multi-line `C-k` __kill-line__ behavior and implemented
    "`-1` `kill-line`" support.
  - [041125] Added basic support for Verilog programming language.
  - [041123] Fixed ftp OSD (auto entering entries broke the password
    field) and modernized.
  - [041028] Fixed. `*find*` buffer exhibits the same behavior as `*grep*`
    buffer. i.e. the `*find*` buffer remains on screen and a pop-up window
    is used to show the file.
  - [041028] Fixed. `*grep*` buffer does not load file when selected 
    with `\<RETURN\>`.
  - [041027] Spruced up old "`apache.conf`" highlighting rules and added
    to release.
  - [041022] Fixed very obscure cvs load-up bug.
  - [041122] Updated schemes to set '_Show cursor in osd_' suitably and to
    make sure the cursor is not red as this conflicts with the match
    fence display.
  - [041120] Fixed [transpose-lines(2)](transpose-lines(2)) crash when [undo(2m)](undo(2m)) mode is
    disabled.
  - [041120] Removed the OSD explicit tab order value as this was not
    constructively used and causes many item order problems.
  - [041119] Many improvements to OSD dialog user interface following
    suggestions for news group. Updated most of the osd dialogs to use
    the new `[*]` check-box chars. Fixed tabbing orders and moved some
    items over to combo-boxes. Added osd-cursor visibility support to
    scheme-edit. Made the displaying of the cursor in an osd dialog
    a [$system(5)]($system(5)) bit set by the highlight scheme and fixed the position
    when in a child dialog.
  - [041118] Added a macro recursion depth limit of 20 to avoid blowing
    up MicroEmacs when the user has created an infinitely recursive
    macro.
  - [041112] Added Paul Boekholt's suggested GNU Emacs key bindings.
  - [041107] [kill-paragraph(2)](kill-paragraph(2)), [fill-paragraph(2)](fill-paragraph(2)), [forward-paragraph(2)](forward-paragraph(2))
    and [backward-paragraph(2)](backward-paragraph(2)) commands redefined. __kill-paragraph__ now
    kills forward and backward rather than control the kill buffer.
    Paragraph movement now defined blank-line to blank-line rather than
    the first/last paragraph line.
  - [041105] Fixed [kill-line(2)](kill-line(2)), [forward-kill-word(2)](forward-kill-word(2)) 
    and [backward-kill-word(2)](backward-kill-word(2)) numerical argument implementation.
  - [041104] Removed __regex-forward(3)__ and __regex-backward(3)__ macros and
    moved uses of them over to [search-buffer(2)](search-buffer(2)).
  - [041104] Added [search-buffer(2)](search-buffer(2)) command which replaces the macro
    commands __regex-forward(3)__ and __regex-backward(3)__. Simplifies macro
    processing of searching by providing a search that explicitly sets
    the [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) and [magic(2m)](magic(2m)) modes. The default is to respect buffers
    exact and magic mode and flags must have `E` or `M` to ensure they are
    disabled.
  - [041104] Changed any use of [kill-line(2)](kill-line(2)) to "`1` `kill-line`" as this
    should maintain its required behavior. A __kill-line__ with no numeric
    argument kills to the end of the line but excludes the end of line
    character (GNU Emacs compatibility). The default binding is the "`1`
    `kill-line`" form, re-bind the key to "`kill-line`" if the end of line
    is not to be killed.
  - [041104] Removed __line(2m)__ and __letter(2m)__ buffer modes as these can
    be done using numerical arguments to bindings. See 
    the [kill-line(2)](kill-line(2)) binding which replaces _line_ mode. 
    See [forward-delete-char(2)](forward-delete-char(2)) and [backward-delete-char(2)](backward-delete-char(2)) binding which
    replaces _letter_ mode.
  - [041104] Changed the [forward-kill-word(2)](forward-kill-word(2)) and [backward-kill-word(2)](backward-kill-word(2))
    commands to be more consistent with GNU Emacs.
  - [041102] Moved winterm over to using `addKeyToBufferOnce()` for mouse
    move and time, also done same for UNIX mouse time event. This
    minimizes the number of mouse moved events that are processed by the
    system.
  - [041101] MS Windows. Fixed mouse cursor disappearing after using a
    _Shift_ or _Control_ mouse button event.
  - [041101] Auto reload the directory even if it is changed
    (`hkdirlst.emf`).
  - [041030] MS-Windows. Removed the "`WM_INPUTLANGCHANGE`" message
    handler as this did the wrong thing (use `Alt-Shift` to change between
    two different keyboards e.g. US and Russian)
  - [041030] MS-Windows. Changed the method used to get the APPDATA path
    to use `SHGetSpecialFolderLocation()` as this is available in all
    versions of Windows.
  - [041030] UNIX. Fixed the mouse movement which caused a rendering
    anomaly. Mouse moved commands are only added to the key buffer if
    the key is not already present in the key queue. This alleviates a
    large build up of redundant mouse move keys on the queue. (Added
    function `addKeyToBufferOnce()`),
  - [041030] Added mouse rectangle region selection methods,
    so [copy-rectangle(3)](copy-rectangle(3)) and [kill-rectangle(2)](kill-rectangle(2)).
  - [041029] Hardened [cpp(9)](cpp(9)) C++ commenting on `//` alignment when the
    previous line is a solid `//////////` when re-styling buffer.
  - [041029] Fixed [find(3)](find(3)) "`*find*`" buffer operation so that it operates
    like "`*grep*`" on file selection. Keyboard file section enabled
    within the "`*grep*`" and "`*find*`" buffer.
  - [041026] Spruced up old "`smb.conf`" highlighting rules, brought them
    up to date with latest keywords and added to release.
  - [041026] Fixed __indent-setup(3)__ osd dialog.
  - [041024] Macro/source compatibility macro and source versions
    updated to "`20041001`".
  - [041024] Fixed the [cvs-diff(3)](cvs-diff(3)) options, local with HEAD was not
    correct.
  - [041024] [latex(9)](latex(9)) template extended. Buffer bindings for underscore
    and quote keys. Search tools to determine current context.
  - [041023] Extended the buffer setup for the [indent(2)](indent(2)) mechanism. May
    now specify the default buffer _indent-width_and _tabsize_ in 
    the [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)) dialog.
  - [041022] Revised indentation implementation. The templates now
    define indent width independent rules. The [indent(2)](indent(2)) command
    '_indent_' parameter may be defined as an absolute indentation or
    using a '`t`' notation. The syntax is "`[-][[indent][/indent]]t`" which
    defines a vulgar fraction of '`t`' which is the indent width (or
    tabsize) as specified by [$buffer-indent-width(5)]($buffer-indent-width(5)) defined below.
  - The global variables __$tabsize(5)__ renamed [$indent-width(5)]($indent-width(5)) and
    controls the global indentation size. __$tabwidth(5)__ 
    renamed [$tab-width(5)]($tab-width(5)) and controls the display size of a literal TAB
    character.
  - The indentation is now specified on a buffer basis, the 
    variables [$buffer-indent-width(5)]($buffer-indent-width(5)) and [$buffer-tab-width(5)]($buffer-tab-width(5)) define the
    indentation and TAB width on a per buffer basis. These are seeded
    from the aforementioned global variables.
  - [041022] Fixed spelling mistake in user interface of XML macros.
  - [041022] Removed CVS "`Log:`" field from all of the template files -
    undesirable.
  - [041022] Added HTTP highlighting to the text document template.
  - [041021] Enhanced Wiki language template.
  - [041021] Added Windows CUA emulation mode.
  - [041019] Fixed insert binding for Nedit emulation mode
  - [041019] Fixed [perl(9)](perl(9)) highlighting rules. Using incorrect syntax.
  - [041016] Fixed UNIX make files for building NE in debug mode.
  - [041016] Fixed termcap entry for __^@__ key (`C-space`). (Thanks to Bob
    Paddock for noting ommission)
  - [041016] Added __M-%__ binding to [query-replace-string(2)](query-replace-string(2)) as built in
    binding. (Thanks to Bob Paddock)
  - [041016] Added Ruby programming language support.
  - [041015] Corrected problem with directory listing loosing
    highlighting (a [@mna(4)](@mna(4)) problem).
  - [041014] Within OSD, fixed spelling mistake. _Loose_ -> _Lose_.
  - [041014] Fixed [delete-hilight-lines(3)](delete-hilight-lines(3)) failure when buffer file has
    changed.
  - [041009] Fixed osd entry scheme as the cursor was not visible in MS
    Dev-Studio Colors.
  - [041009] Added Wiki language template
  - [041003] Wheel mouse binding added as default.
  - [041003] Catch long lines from cut and paste, resolve crash.
  - [041002] Added X-Windows drag and drop support using __xdnd__.
  - [040930] Added HTML, XML and SGML close bracket auto expansion.
  - [040930] Added XML and HTML verification macro. Added XML utilities
    macros to allow next and previous tag to be matched. The XML
    utilities are also used by SGML.
  - [040930] Added `xxxx-pre-expand-abbrev` hook so that macros may add
    their own expansion methods.
  - [040917] Added `\<...\>` as supported fences.
  - [040917] Fixed the `-1` [add-next-line(2)](add-next-line(2)) ignore line feature.
  - [040915] [cvs-add(3)](cvs-add(3)) looks for a Tags file in the CVS directory and
    sets the GUI state appropriately. Added server to the [cvs-state(3)](cvs-state(3))
    line mangling.
  - [040909] [cvs(3)](cvs(3)) GUI updated with new features. Added repository set
    up to the UI. Reduced wait time on long commands by using ipipe.
    Allowed `-z` option to be used with [%cvs-com(5)](%cvs-com(5)).
  - [040828] [About](about(2)) page includes the century in the date (suggested by Th).
  - [040824] Fix for man page hyper-link when includes `-/./_` characters.
  - [040814] Linux manual page formatting fixes.

  __Minor Patch - July 2004__

  - [040728] Released patches.
  - [040728] Corrected Linux kernel 2.6 pty allocation.

    Doxygen comment formation omitted.
  - [040518] Corrected block comment formatting, adding an extra space
    at the end of the comment.

  __7th Release - March 2004__

  - [040326] Release wrapped - public release tag is __20040301__ for
    executable and macros.
  - [040326] Support for MAC O/S Darwin image. Console only (no build
    machine available for X-11 version).
  - [040326] Introduction of UPX on Windows and DOS executables for __ne__
    only.
  - [040326] Support for MS-DOS long name under DJGPP v2.0. For version
    2.0 then the DJGPP functions must be invoked rather than the MS-DOS
    BIOS calls otherwise the modified short name is returned. DJGPP v1
    is still supported original definitions maintained.
  - [040326] Added [filetype(3f)](filetype(3f)) macro to determine the file type of
    MS-DOS, Windows or UNIX.
  - [040322] _$mouse_ variables configured under console modes to allow
    pseudo mouse operations to be performed.
  - [040322] Fixed the __win32s__ build and emain.h definitions. Mouse was
    not supported under _win32s_ through incorrect configuration
    definition.
  - [040322] Key bindings for the file browser. `ENTER` now handled on the
    reserved fields to sort. `BACKSPACE` now moves up a directory level.
  - [040322] Changed the interface to __cvs__, __ftp__ and __file-browser__ command
    so that if a numeric argument of `0` is given then the directory tree
    window is not opened, just the `*files*` buffer.
  - [040322] AutoIt hook. Thanks to Dr Detlef Groth.
  - [040322] Added CSS template. Thanks to Gabriel Tabares-Barreiro.
  - [040318] Fix to Microsoft Windows clipboard when operating with VNC.
  - [040317] Macro and source release set to "`20040301`".
  - [040317] Added [find(3)](find(3)) command to macro set.
  - [040317] Corrected [rgrep(3)](rgrep(3)) to use the [%xfind-com(5)](%xfind-com(5)) to specify 
    the __find(1)__ command.
  - [040310] Fix to graphical diff - [gdiff(3)](gdiff(3)). Occasions where all
    changes had been accepted and the changes could not be saved. gdiff
    incorrectly prompted user to accept all changes first.
  - [040310] Support for multiple comment styles in the same language
    template. Additional comment styles are defined in the "`hkXXX.emf`"
    file with the syntax "`.fhook-XXX.comment-N`" where "`N`" is an integer
    starting for _1_ to _n_, the number of different comment styles.
    Templates updated to use multiple comment styles where appropriate
    (C, C++ and SQL).
  - [040310] Support the '_r_' flag in "`.fhook-XXX.comment`" flag field.
    Causes the key binding to "`esc-o`" and "`esc-q`" to restyle the
    comment. All templates updated to include the flag where
    appropriate.
  - [040310] [cvs(3)](cvs(3)) operates asynchronously using ipipes. Refresh
    problems resolved.
  - [040310] [narrow-search-forward(3)](narrow-search-forward(3)) bound to "`C-c s`",
    and [narrow-search-backward(3)](narrow-search-backward(3)) bound to "`C-c r`".
  - [040308] [ipipe-shell-command(2)](ipipe-shell-command(2)) includes additional flag to run in
    "_raw mode_" where the buffer is not annotated and wrap is disabled.
    Additional argument added to command to allow the [$buffer-ipipe(5)]($buffer-ipipe(5))
    macro to be defined when the pipe is defined. Corrected operation
    of [pipe-shell-command(2)](pipe-shell-command(2)) where _ipipe_ automatically degrades to a _pipe_
    (Windows only), if degraded then the [$buffer-ipipe(5)]($buffer-ipipe(5)) macro is still
    invoked on completion.
  - [040226] Deleted "`cygnus.emf`" added "`cygwin.emf`" for [cygwin(3)](cygwin(3)) BASH
    shell support under Windows. Corrected the shell operation with
    macro layer for echo and completion.
  - [040224] Add new _narrow out unhilighted lines_ feature.
  - [040223] Add new buffer tab list toolbar tool for rapid access to
    buffers via a top or bottom toolbar.
  - [040223] Add `\<\>` buttons to tool-bar mode lines to scroll left and
    right.
  - [040223] Fixed. Calender day is off by one when going backwards to
    before 2004.
  - [040223] Fixed. Executing 'me' (__user-setup__ __->__ __Current__)
    breaks   [auto-spell(3)](auto-spell(3))   until   a   main   spell   command   ,   [spell-word(3)](spell-word(3)) 
    or  [spell-buffer(3)](spell-buffer(3)) is executed.
  - [040223] [cvs(3)](cvs(3)) directory listing file loss solved. Differences
    between CVS command line operations and directory list operations
    resolved, both now produce the same results.
  - [040229] Fixed UNIX signal lock synchronization, solves problems
     with read failing following FTP or HTTP command.
  - [040223] Add new [narrow-search-forward(3)](narrow-search-forward(3)) and
    [narrow-search-backward(3)](narrow-search-backward(3)) commands.
  - [040220] Mouse wheel operation fixed. Added new __mouse-wup-scroll__
    commands that should be used instead.
  - [040218] Added '_Invert Selection_' to context menu.
  - [040218] Add '`f5`' refresh binding to a dir list buffer.
  - [040218] Fixed. Need some way of opening the right mouse button menu
    using a key. Also need so termcap bindings to open main and context
    menus. Created new context-menu command, bound to `S-f1` and the
    windows 'menu' key (aka windows) and created binds to open main menu
   (__esc =__) and context menu (__esc +__) on termcap platforms.
  - [040217] Fixed. __2__ [popup-window(2)](popup-window(2)) does not work on an XTerm, no
    implementation in function `meFrameXTermMakeCur`.
  - [040217] Fixed. CVS status of directories is not shown. Also add '`b`'
    and '`o`' file type flags.
  - [040216] Fixed. ME __build.bat -l__ options do not work in standard
    cmd/command as there use 4DOS '`>>&`' extension. Changed to using `2>&1`
    which works on cmd & 4nt but breaks 4Dos and command.
  - [040216] Fixed bottom Toolbar window grows when CVS is opened,
    then [change-window-depth(2)](change-window-depth(2)) does not respect bit 2 of [$window-flags(5)]($window-flags(5)).
  - [040214] Added __.spec__ template for RedHat RPM package file
    specification.
  - [040214] Added __.psf__ template for HP-UX depot product file
    specification.
  - [040214] Recognize `-*- makefile -*-` and `-*- sh -*-`.
  - [040213] Fixed reframe _cvs-console_ better so the exit status can be
    easily seen from a small window.
  - [040213] PHP script can be started with '`\<?`' tag in a php file.
  - [040213] Corrected UNIX ishell operation when "__su__" to another user.
    Locking up or generally behaving badly (termio not initialized).
    Affects all UNIX platforms.
  - [040213] Documented the create/delete/next-frame keys.
  - [040210] Fixed toolbar Directory File List does not contain "`../`" -
    UNIX only.
  - [040210] Fixed. On UNIX only the [$progname(5)]($progname(5)) may not be fully
    expanded (has just "me") which may lead to a ctags generation error
    and an alternate fix to [$search-path(5)]($search-path(5)).
  - [040210] Fixed. On UNIX, [find-file(2)](find-file(2)) of a symbolic link which
    points to a directory results in a bad dir listing. The list of
    files is correct but the statistics are all wrong (found on SunOS 5.8).
  - [040210] Fix subtle ftp bug with alias ftp addressed. Create an ftp
    site "`ftp://test/`" say with user name foo and password bar and then
    load in "`ftp://test/dir1/`" the buffer file name is correctly set as
    "`ftp://test/dir1/`" but the 'Directory listing of:' line is set to
    "`ftp://foo@test/dir1/`". Firstly the user may wish the '_foo_' to be
    hidden but secondly with the introduction of being able to click on
    the '_Directory_ _listing of:_' line this has introduced a subtle
    inefficiency/bug, if I click on the '`foo@test`' ME will load
    "`ftp://foo@test/`" not "`ftp://test/`" which to ME is a completely
    different file. This can in turn lead to "`ftp://foo@test/dir1/`"
    being loaded so you can end up with 2 copies of every dir being
    loaded! The fix is to make the '_Directory listing of:_' line the
    same, i.e. "`ftp://test/dir1/`"
  - [040208] Fixed. "__-n__" command line option to a console build causes a
    option failure and the executable does not run.
  - [040208] Corrected UNIX jasspa tree search when executable is in CWD
    and there is no executable path.
  - [040206] __RC4 - Release Candidate 4 - MicroEmacs '04__
  - [040206] Fixes for tool-bar Buffer Item List update problem. Thanks
    to Dr. Detlef Groth.
  - [040206] Added template support for XML. Thanks to Dr. Detlef Groth.
  - [040204] Re-worked Microsoft Windows [me32.ini(8)](me32.ini(8)) file specification.
    Order revised and lookup simplified.
  - [040203] "_user-setup_" changed name to "_Rebind Home Keys_" for
    re-binding of `home` and `end` keys to start/end of line. Removed "`C-v`"
    binding that existed with old "_MS keys" label_.
  - [040203] Reworked all user defined defined directory save locations,
    ftp, spell, etc..
  - [040203] Corrected osf1, openBSD and zaraus emf files.
  - [040203] Added [%cvs-com(5)](%cvs-com(5)) variable to define the CVS command.
  - [040203] XML template extended to include javascript.
  - [040130] 2nd iteration of prototype and near final revision of new
    user setup.
  - Following an internal review of RC3 then it has been decided to
    address the issues of user configuration prior to a full release.
    This specifically addresses the location of user MicroEmacs
    configuration directories and search paths. User configuration has
    traditionally required the setting of external environment variables
    such as "$MEPATH" and for the user to create a private directory to
    store user settings. This is proving difficult for new users who
    just want to run the editor. RC4 and subsequent releases will
    address these problems by determining the correct location for
    configuration files and create the appropriate files and directories
    under user control.
  - The net result of these changes should significantly simplify
    installation and setup as follows:
  - All platforms will be able to run without any manual user setup or
    the requirement for specific MicroEmacs environment variables.
  - User defined directories and configuration files will be created
    under editor control on detecting a new user.
  - Existing installations using `$MEPATH` will be backwards compatible
    with the new build.
  - All platforms now support a searching jasspa sub-directory structure
    of __company__ / __spelling__ / __macros__. This was traditionally limited to
    the Windows Install Shield installation but has been extended across
    all platforms.
  - Two new environment variables are provided for user or system
    administrator use. [$MEINSTALLPATH(5)]($MEINSTALLPATH(5)) defines the location of the
    MicroEmacs standard macros and allows the built in search path to be
    overridden. [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)) defines the location of the user private
    configuration directory and allows the user to locate their private
    directory in different location. In a standard install neither of
    these variables will be required.
  - The Microsoft Windows system defined application path will be used
    for user configuration files. This is applicable for roaming users
    where the application directory is stored on a server.
  - The use of the [me32.ini(8)](me32.ini(8)) file on MicroSoft Windows environments is
    not required, but is still supported.
  - The UNIX path searching is improved. `/usr/local/microemacs` will be
    depreciated and replaced with `/usr/local/jasspa` in addition other
    standard path locations are supported on a per-platform basis.
  - On UNIX then the directory `~/.jasspa` shall contain the user
    configuration files. Optionally the __company__, __spelling__ and __macros__
    sub-directories may be included in this directory where access to
    the system directory locations by the user is not permitted.
  - Concept of guest has been removed. `guest.emf` and `guest.erf` removed
    replaced with _newuser_. [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) no longer supports setting of
    name.
  - Internal variables [$user-name(5)]($user-name(5)) and [$user-path(5)]($user-path(5)) are defined.
  - [040128] Fixed re-style for C/C++ comments in vertical alignment.
  - [040123] "_user-setup_" mouse button selection fixed.
  - [040123] `C-x 3` mapped to [split-window-horizontally(2)](split-window-horizontally(2)), `C-x 5` mapped
    to [create-frame(2)](create-frame(2)).
  - [040122] Added support for Zaurus, thanks to Pierre Gaston
  - [040122] Fixes for non-US keyboards under X-Windows, thanks to
    Pierre Gaston and Dr. Detlef Groth
  - [040122] Added support for OSF1, thanks to Dr. Detlef Groth
  - [040122] Added support for OpenBSD
  - [040122] [ml-bind-key(2)](ml-bind-key(2)) supports new binding for next/previous file,
    history search uses `up`/`down` `C-p`/`C-n`, prompted by Gabriel.
  - [040122] New key bindings for [create-frame(2)](create-frame(2)).
  - [040119] __RC3 - Release Candidate 3 - MicroEmacs '04__
  - [040119] Fast exit out of fold fixed.
  - [040119] Added [copy-rectangle(3)](copy-rectangle(3)) and [yank-rectangle-overwrite(3)](yank-rectangle-overwrite(3))
    commands.
  - [040119] Collapse line format now includes the end token so that
    indent operates correctly following a fold.
  - [040119] [narrow-buffer(2)](narrow-buffer(2)) numeric argument and command line options
    extended for mark-up lines.
  - [040119] `spawn.c` compilation warnings removed.
  - [040119] Updated templates for Python and AsmX86 - thanks to Pedro
    Gomes.
  - [040119] Added "`*compile*`" hilighting and `ENTER` selects error file
    and line - prompted by Salman Khilji.

    (say).
  - [030608] MS-Shift region. Check for [kill-rectangle(2)](kill-rectangle(2)) and treat like
    we do the [kill-region(2)](kill-region(2)).
  - [030608] Added new -ve argument to [insert-file(2)](insert-file(2)) which inserts only
    a section of the file. Optimized the [file-op(2)](file-op(2)) move command to try
    just moving the file first.
  - [030608] Changed the addLine function so it always flags the line as
    changed, this avoids some bizarre issues when macros delete an
    insert lines of text (best shown by the buffer-info tool-bar tool).

    version.
  - [030608] Changing the addLine function to always set the changed
    flag meant all macros became hidden, use different bits.

    variable.
  - [030514] HTML Template. Changed __html-fold__ __->__ __collapse__, reported
    goto-matching-tag failure.
  - [030514] Buffer initialization. Changed the fold-setup call so that
    it gets called if likely to be required - use the new buffer-fhook
    variable [$result(5)]($result(5)) setting to help in determining this.
  - [030514] Folding. Changed the fold-setup so a setup string can be
    passed in rather than searching for one in the buffer, aimed at
    utilizing the new buffer-fhook [$result(5)]($result(5)) setting.
  - [030514] Set [$result(5)]($result(5)) to the magic fhook string so the fhook macro
    does not have to search for it again in buffer.c.

  - [030513] Search. Added region line hilighting support.

  - [030512] Ipipe fix for SunOS.
  - [030512] Changedthe line flag implementation to be more flexible and

    flags available.
  - [030512] Improvedthe AMark setting and deleting.
  - [030512] Added a Protected Line flag and vastly improved the
    narrowing. Renamed most function in `line.c` to make them more
    readable.
  - [030512] Big return value change to get functions consistent - found
    that the return values of low level line functions where different
    to high level functions making the code hard to read and dangerous.
    Also needed a consistent triple value return (true false and error)
    so change `meABORT` to -1 across the board.

  - [011029] hklatex.emf item-list support (hit "f7").
  - [011028] hklatex.emf has a greatly improved pseudo highlighting.
  - [011028] Tweaked the "@fs" variable to improve its usability.
  - [011028] set-position can now store the mark position.
  - [011028] Fixes to windows file times.
  - [011016] New caps-lock, num-lock, scroll-lock and pause key support
    for win32 & unix. The "*-lock" implementation to be more like
    "S-pick" and "C-pick" as the keys are automatically supported (like
    the shift) so there are no default binds to void, the keys are only
    generated if there are bound. Could not implement this on MS-DOS.
  - [011016] which command built in i.e. "M-x which". Used for command
    utilities.
  - [011026] A new Hide value feature when inputting strings, this is
    now used be the crypt and ftp Password entry. The string is shown as
    '*'s.
  - [011025] Utilized the latest screen-update improvements to make the
    gdiff screen update rock solid.
  - [011025] mlGetChar fix. The key "return" was the 78th special char,
    i.e. "SKEY_SPEC"|'N' and as the mlGetChar did not check the
    "SKEY_SPEC" bits, pressing return was like pressing 'N' so on a
    "Y/N" prompt try pressing return, its like saying No! .
  - [011016] Spelling dictionaries renamed with ISO naming scheme.
    Because of the language changes, you need to rename your personal
    dictionary to lsdpengb.edf for British and lsdpenus.edf for
    American.
  - [011016] Highlighting brackets/braces as requested from user base.
    The highlight braces required some other subtle changes to
    screen-update and show-region and the addition of the "rbin" mode
    means that this version is incompatible with the last in quite a few
    areas.
  - [011016] Fixed mouse handler (turns out that if the pick event was
    lost (use "@cg" or an error) then me would lock!).
  - [011016] Extended control on indent tab and return behavior (can
    disable the tab behavior).
  - [011016] C++ name space indentation support.
  - [011016] New language support interface so spelling is not required
    for a language to be supported (may only want the basic alphabet
    setup etc).
  - [011016] Changed file loading interface so all commands (like
    view-file) can load in "bin", "crypt" or "rbin" mode.
  - [010123] Reduced binary mode added (rbin).

  __4th Release - August 2001__

  - [010813] OSD bug fix for fixed size dialog boxes.
  - [010812] Inclusion of occur regexp function.
  - [010812] List function for summarizing file contents ("F7" /
    "Esc-F7" to close).

    Default guest setup font selection for cleaner 'first' page.
  - [010716] CVS macro update. Changed "cvs-diff" to "cvs-gdiff" and
    introduced a new "cvs-diff" which just gives the "diff" output and
    fixed several bugs when running with a CVS server. Also added
    support for the CVS/Template file when committing.
  - [010716] Minor update to the CVS help page for the aforementioned
    (Affected all help files).

  __3rd Release - July 2001__

    (cbox.emf/me.ehf).
  - [010710] Added a 'Plain Text' char set which only uses plain letters
    (charset.emf).
  - [010710] Fixed many little comment formatting bugs and annoyances
    (comment.emf).
  - [010710] Changes required to build on MS-DOS using DJGPP v1.
  - [010705] Bug fix for windows rendering crash.
  - [010630] Minor reorder to X-Windows initialization for cygwin
    X-Server.
  - [010507] Added generic commands for the creation, deletion and
    reformatting of comments now used by most of the file hooks.
  - [010412] Added new generic buffer setup, menu and help macros,
    creating the new [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)) command. Ported all existing file
    hooks to this new interface greatly reducing the buffer hook size
    while increasing its functionality and consistency.
  - [010402] Added support for new [$buffer-backup(5)]($buffer-backup(5)) variable for
    setting the back-up file location.
  - [010312] Support for new key bindings allowing CU emulations. Nedit
    bindings provided as example. Major work to enable the complete
    re-binding of all keys so the user interface to MicroEmacs can be
    completely changed, this allows for example a Windows feel to be
    created. This required many internal ghosts to be exorcized and add
    new macro functions.
  - [010308] User buffer configuration menu added.
  - [010308] Improved Python support (Contribution PG).
  - [010304] Bug fixes to hilighting logic.

  - [010210] Revised programming language templates; simplified the
    common elements used in configuring the templates.
  - [010202] Added new [command-wait(2)](command-wait(2)) command to enable macros to wait
    for user dependent completion, used in "gdiff".
  - [010202] Changed buffer variables to except the form
    "`:\<buffer-name\>:\<variable\>`", like command variables. This allows
    macros to access variable not defined in the current buffer.
  - [010126] File "autosave" location changes. Control save name and
    location.
  - [001005] OSD speedups.
  - [001005] Improved and increased the file system operations via the
    new [file-op(2)](file-op(2)) command, created better menus in the [file-browser(3)](file-browser(3)).
  - [001010] Revamped the main ftp GUI to make it work much more
    rationally.
  - [001010] Improved [ipipe-shell-command(2)](ipipe-shell-command(2)) efficiency on Windows by
    introducing a new thread approach to listen for activity.
    Implemented a shell command-line in an ipiped environment
    so [ishell(3)](ishell(3)) command is now usable on Windows platforms.
  - [001010] Added new [set-position(2)](set-position(2)) which can be used to store all
    information about the current window and [goto-position(2)](goto-position(2)) which will
    then restore them. Allowed macros to use non-letter characters for
    alpha marks and positions so they no longer need to clobber user
    ones.
  - [001010] Added new "-k" and "-u" command-line options and improved
    "-s" option.
  - [000922] Added GUI for tag dialogue for tags generation.
  - [000922] Recursive tags support (i.e. nested directory tag
    traversal).
  - [000810] emain.h "#define"'s properly supported again so MicroEmacs
    can be successfully compiled without options like SPELL and OSD etc.
    This can reduce the binary size by up to 37%.
  - [000718] Source trees now maintained under CVS.
  - [000719] Improved TCL/TK and Perl template support.

    2000/03/22
  - [000322] Internal reorganization of platform option selection.
  - [000322] Minor fixes X-Windows color selection.
  - [000322] Minor fixes in the OSD.
  - [000322] Reviewed the documentation mode. A text description of the
    using the documentation modes is included in the distribution in the
    text directory.
  - [000322] Minor modifications to support Borland 5.5 compiler
    (win32b55.mak).
  - [000322] Support for Openstep 4.2 / NeXT Motorola 040 (Termcap

  - [000322] New font rendering, supporting bold, italic, underline etc.
    All platforms modified to cope with font scheme definitions.
    Platforms optimized for speed.
  - [000126] Beta build revision contains version information for
    2000/01/26.
  - [000126] Directory file copy. Within this release files in the
    directory listings may be selected for copy and pasting from the
    menu. Use the right mouse button to pop-up a menu in the directory
    buffers. Copy and paste to/from a ftp directory buffer to a local
    drive buffer may be used to initiate an ftp transfer. (This is how
    these pages are uploaded).
  - [000126] New command ftp opens a ftp connection using a dialog. Use
    may save the host connection information in a registry file. Note
    that the password information is exposed so be careful where this is
    used - if in doubt do not enter the password and you will be
    prompted.
  - [000126] New command [uniq(3)](uniq(3)) operates as the UNIX of the same name.
    used with sort, and reduces to unique lines.
  - [000126] Character translation; addition of character translation
    macros when moving between character sets. Accessible from Menu ->
    Format -> Change Buffer Char Set.
  - [000126] Support for additional character sets, Windows GREEK,
    Windows TURKISH.
  - [000126] Line highlighting selection with the use of the mouse and
    auto search. When using the mouse selection to set up the line
    highlighting when invoked from a right-mouse -> Hilight Line ->
    color/remove selection; the macro determines the mouse selected
    region and makes an appropriate decision as to how the line
    highlighting scheme is to be applied. The following rules apply to
    the mouse selection:-
     - Point in line selected (i.e. mark == point) Highlight the line only.
     - Region in the line selected. Both point and mark are on the same
          line. Extract the selected text and hilight all lines that match
          the search pattern. The color "remove" is also pattern matched
          to selectively remove lines.
     - Region selected mark & point on different lines Block up the
          region with appropriate highlight.
     - Note that line highlighting may be safely used in a folded
          buffer.
     - [000126] Addition of special rendered space character. You may
          toggle this from the keyboard using a macro in your user.emf as
          follows:-

            ; Macro to enable the display of TAB/CR. Note that we
            ; force the screen to be updated.
            define-macro tab-display
            set-variable $system &bxor $system 0x80000
            screen-update
            !emacro
            global-bind-key "tab-display" "f11"

  - [000126] Documentation update on new features (contained in me.ehf).
  - [000114] Fixed font selection bug in 000112 beta.
  - [000112] Revised color hilighting schemes, reduced the number of
    colors in a number of schemes. Introduction of the Sherwood Forest
    color scheme (green theme obviously !!).
  - [000112] Small revision to the user interface with respect to font
    selection. In order to make character set selection easier then the
    multiple choices for the box characters have been removed from Menu
    -> Help -> User Setup. These have been replaced with a new check box
    Extended Char Set. This box should be checked to enable the special
    rendering characters and enable the box characters - this is
    typically enabled on X-Windows and MS-Windows.
  - [000112] Provision for directory list sorting on name, modification
    time and size. Selecting the directory column title performs a
    re-sort based on the selection, a further selection reverses the
    order of the list.
  - [000112] Addition of ftp support (meu build on Windows, enabled by
    default on UNIX). Enables files to be edited via ftp, (read and
    write supported). Transfer to another system using
    ftp://[\<user\>[:\<password]@]\>\<host\>[:\<port\>]/\<pathname\>.
  - [000112] Improved source code provision for foreign languages,
    various internal problems. Support for Russian (Windows and Cyrillic
    koi8-r).
  - [000112] Y2K problems with time stamping and mode line date.
  - [000112] New spelling rules for number sequences and specialized
    wild card sequences. Within the rule file (i.e. americar.emf,
    britishr.emf, etc.) then the following spelling rules may be added
    to cope with numeric sequences. The addition of these rules will
    spell check hexadecimal sequences and validate numeric sequences
    such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc. A spelling of "1nd" would generate a
    spelling error. This has not been performed for other languages so
    submissions for other language equivalents would be appreciated.

            ; Add some special word rules to make life easier.
            ; These are for 1st, 2nd 3rd etc.
            add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?1\\(st\\|ST\\)"
            add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?2\\(nd\\|ND\\)"
            add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?3\\(rd\\|RD\\)"
            add-spell-rule "*" "[0-9]*1[0-9]\\(th\\|TH\\)"
            add-spell-rule "*" "[0-9]*[04-9]\\(th\\|TH\\)"
            add-spell-rule "*" "0[xX][[:xdigit:]]+"
            ; Spell rules for unit definitions.
            ; These are for 50Mb, 10Kg, -45.56cm 12ft 10.00am 16.00pm etc.
            add-spell-rule "*" "-?\\([0-9]*.\\)?[0-9]+\\(Kg\\|Kb\\|Gb\\|Tb ...
            \\|Mb\\|mm\\|cm\\|m\\|Km\\|ft\\|inch\\|mph\\|lb\\|am\\|pm\\)"

  - [000112] Box selection copy and paste. Bindings are defined as `Esc C-w`
    for [kill-rectangle(2)](kill-rectangle(2)) `Esc C-y` [yank-rectangle(2)](yank-rectangle(2)).
  - [000112] Enhanced info file hilighting (Thanks to Dr. Detlef Groth
    for this).
  - [000112] New copy-file command, typically used by the macro language
    for moving files around.
  - [000112] Error reporting of bad command line arguments in Microsoft
    Windows environment (Thanks to Pedro Gomes for this).

  __2nd Release - November 1999__

  - [991101] Enhanced the latex support macros following various
    contributions from users.

    simple mechanism to allow the user to add a file to a favorites
    list.
  - [991101] Ground up implementation of the regular expression pattern
    matcher, following licensing problems with the GNU regex. The
    resultant pattern matcher is now a little faster than GNU regex and
    is capable of all of the standard regular expression pattern
    matches. The pattern matcher has diverged from GNU in that double
    backslashes are required in the character classes [..] to allow for
    escape sequence short cuts such as '\n' (newline), '\t' (tab) etc.
    It was felt that this compromise was better than having to quote the
    more obscure search characters.
  - [991101] Changed the hilighting and indenting syntax to be GNU regex
    compliant.
  - [991101] Modified compare-windows to ignore white space by default,
    compare-windows-exact performs an exact character for character
    comparison.
  - [991101] Enhanced the tags support to handle multiple tags and
    recursive directory tree searching.
  - [991101] Implemented osd-help, a gui front end to the on-line help.
    Required changes to the help system which gives macros access to the
    on-line help buffer, needed for the index and search.
  - [991101] Over-hauled the highlighting scheme files and editor to
    support the disabling of buffer highlighting.
  - [991101] Many bugs fixed on all platforms, in particular unix
    cutting and pasting (crashes exceed) and focus problems and NT exit
    delay.
  - [991101] Added tab and newline character printing in buffers.
  - [991101] Introduced message line variables "@mx" and "@mxa".
  - [991101] New Games - Crossword cracker. The ideal way to cheat at
    crosswords. Uses the spelling dictionary to guess at the word, given
    a number of known letters.
  - [991101] Hook file protection against globally bound keys - prevents
    re-binding of user defined keys within the macro.
  - [991101] Search/Replace fix for exact mode. Environment variable
    search path fix.
  - [991101] hkm4.emf added back into the release (seemed to have gone
    missing).
  - [991101] Cut and paste fix when running the UNIX version through an
    X-Server such as Exceed in the Windows environment.
  - [991101] Plain text printer device added.
  - [991101] Obscure OSD fix.
  - [991101] New OSD help search facility Menu->Help->General Help.
  - [991101] Fix for NT hang-up on shut down (typically encountered when
    running a source debugger).
  - [991101] Fix for NT process spawning with spaces in the names.
  - [991101] Metris macro fix, OSD bug fix, NT display fix.
  - [991101] New - color scheme, GVim look.
  - [991101] New - Unix/Linux support for Wheel Mouse (mouse.emf).
  - [991101] New - Color schemes, Plain; for those that do not care for
    an abundance of colors.
  - [991101] Modified the numeric key-pad behavior to be consistent on
    all platforms. Problems were noted with the UNIX number lock
    orientation which was reversed.
  - [991101] New - Color scheme variables which allow the hkXXX files to
    determine the level of hilighting to apply to their templates.
  - [991101] Line length fix; more graceful behavior (i.e. does not
    crash) when the line length exceeds 64K.
  - [991101] Intercept the windows 105 keyboard application key
    (typically right hand side of keyboard next to the control key). The
    key is called "menu". By default this is bound in win32.emf, however
    users may bind it as a prefix for their own key combinations in much
    the same way as "Alt" or "C-x" if required.
  - [991101] New; OMG's IDL language template added.
  - [991101] Fix for windows short name in next-buffer.

## QUESTION (00)


  New functionality; what is useful to me as an old MicroEmacs user ??


## ANSWER


  There are a lot of new features in this distribution. Assuming that you
  just want to use the editor (and have cottoned onto the fact that there
  are now scroll bars etc.) then the most frequent commands that we use
  are:-

  [grep(3)](grep(3)) - May need to set up in _<user>.emf_.  
  [diff(3)](diff(3)) - May need to set up in _<user>.emf_.  
  [compile(3)](compile(3)) - May need to set up in _<user>.emf_.  
  [clean(3)](clean(3)) - cleans a buffer, removing spaces etc.  
  [restyle-buffer(3)](restyle-buffer(3)) - Reformats 'C' + known languages.  
  [spell-buffer(3)](spell-buffer(3)) - For documentation work, spells the buffer.  
  __C-s__ - [isearch-forward(2)](isearch-forward(2)) incremental search.  
  __C-x u__ or `C-_` - [undo(2)](undo(2)) undoes edits.  
  __F10__ - [file-browser(3)](file-browser(3)) allows the file system to be browsed  

  Other useful macros include:-

  [tabs-to-spaces(3)](tabs-to-spaces(3)) - Good for sorting out the mess made by Microsoft Developer Studio.  
  [sort-lines(2)](sort-lines(2)) - Two versions of this, allows marked lines to be sorted alphabetically.  

  Be wary of:-

   __esc-o__ - [fill-paragraph(2)](fill-paragraph(2)). The default mode is an automatic
  mode  which attempts to guess at the format required. It works most of the time. 
  Also works in 'C'.

  Most of the other new features are in the background, such as the macro  
  processor, indentation control, color hilighting, indentation control,  
  auto-saving etc.

  To have a look at the features developed since 2009 have a look at [faq44](faq44(0f)) and 
  [faq45](faq45(0f)).

## QUESTION (01)


  Languages; Are any foreign languages supported other than English ??


## ANSWER


  Unfortunately as we started with V3.8 as a base many years ago, we missed  
  the distribution with foreign language extensions. We have not  
  incorporated them into the release.  

  The May 1999 release improves the language support by supporting the  
  ISO-Latin character sets.  

  We do have spelling dictionaries for French, Spanish, Portuguese and  
  German. Other languages may be supported by transforming native __ispell(1)__  
  dictionaries.  

  If there is enough interest in this release from people with foreign  
  languages then we may consider including support for foreign language(s).  
  However we would be very much reliant on external help for local testing  
  and translation. We would be open to suggestions.

## QUESTION (02)


  C++ is not default, C is - how do I change this ??


## ANSWER


  If your main programming language is C++, then you will require the `.def`  
  and `.h` files to be loaded in C++ mode by default, rather than 'C'. To  
  modify this hen the order of the file hooks has to be re-defined.  

  Within your _<user>.emf_, over-ride the default ordering by including the
  line:-
  
```{.emf}
        add-file-hook ".h .def"                                     fhook-cpp

```

  This adds a newer binding for "`.h`" and "`.def`" to C++, over-riding the  
  existing 'C' binding.

## QUESTION (03)


  GNU Emacs; are there any GNU Emacs bindings. ?


## ANSWER


  No not at the moment. The GNU Emacs bindings would be added as a  
  compatibility file (meemacs.emf) in much the same way that the me3.8  
  bindings are added, see meme3_8.emf.

  From the user-setup(3), the user would then ask for "gnu" compatibility.

  We would welcome submissions for a gnu compatibility file, gnu.emf, to add  
  to the release.

  The __Meta__ key (typically `Alt`) may be bound to key strokes, as opposed to  
  the menu short-cut from the [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) as follows:-  

  __Tools__ -> __User Setup__ -> __General__ -> __Alt Action: Main Menu Hot-keys__ = N
  __Tools__ -> __User Setup__ -> __General__ -> __Alt Action: Esc Prefix__ = Y

## QUESTION (04)


  Icons are not displayed correctly in Microsoft Windows environments !!


## ANSWER


  After installing on Microsoft platforms, the Icons in the Explorer window  
  may not be showing correctly. To remedy the situation then the following  
  steps may be taken.  

  __Windows '95__
  
  >  Try re-starting the system first. If the icons are still incorrect
     then re-start in Safe mode and delete the file:

         `c:\windows\ShellIconCache`

  Restart and the Icons should be correct.

  __Window '98__
  
  >   Try re-starting the system first. If the Icons are still incorrect
      then re-start in Safe mode, this should re-generate the Icon cache.
      Restart windows.

  __NT__
  
  >   Restart the system.

## QUESTION (05)


  ipipes not working on Microsoft Windows network drives ?


## ANSWER


  We are aware of a problem with the ipipe commands with '95 and '98 (not 
  sure about NT) when the current drive is a Novel network drive.

  Although we have not been ably to fully characterize the problem, we know 
  that:-

  - Old Novel Clients prior to 2.2 - Does not work
  - Novel Intranetware Client 2.2 - Does not work.
  - Novel Network Client 2.5 - Does work.
  - Novel Client 3.01 - Does work.

  Any other information in this area would be appreciated to fully  
  characterize the problem.

  To get around the problem then disable ipipes using [$system(5)]($system(5)). From
  within your _<user>.emf_ knock off bit 0x800 from [$system(5)]($system(5)). This will
  enable regular pipes, which will work, albeit not in the background.

## QUESTION (06)


  Language not supported - will it be ??


## ANSWER


  We only support the (programming) languages that we have come into contact
  with. If you are using a language that we are not supporting then you will
  need to write a new `hk<language>.emf` file. See [Language Templates](languageTemplates(2)) on how
  to map a new programming language. The list of currently supported file
  types is defined in [Supported File Types](MicroEmacs - Supported File Types).

  Jasspa would appreciate any new templates that people define for standard
  file types so that we can add them to the distribution.

  For Microsoft Windows, any associated "me" icons types would also be
  appreciated.

- [[FAQ Index]](Frequently Asked Questions).
!! me-id: amicr048
! 0ffaq07
## QUESTION (07)


  Language file is incomplete


## ANSWER


  For a number of the (programming) language templates we have only provided
  a sub-set of the commands, this is typically because we only use a sub-set
  ourselves.

  For a number of templates, there is no indent support (see [indent(2)](indent(2)) and
  [Supported File Types](MicroEmacs - Supported File Types)).

  Note that when extending the template then only standard words should be
  added. Words which are local extensions should be added to a `myXXX.emf`.

  Jasspa would appreciate completed template definitions.

## QUESTION (08)


  Input locked up and not accepting keys; how do I unlock ?


## ANSWER


  This sometimes happens if a macro has been aborted badly. Typically a few
  "Ctrl-G"s (see [abort-command(2)](abort-command(2))) will terminate the macro and return
  control back to the caller.

## QUESTION (09)


  MicroEmacs Bindings; How do I get the original MicroEmacs bindings ?


## ANSWER


  From [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) set the Emulation to "`MicroEmacs v3.8`". On re-starting
  (or Current) the macro file `meme3_8.emf` is executed and the bindings
  loaded. This file should restore your familiar execution set.

## QUESTION (10)


  Microsoft Windows Locks up after killing an ipipe.


## ANSWER


  This is a known problem for '95/'98 (not NT), on killing an ipipe.  
  Sometimes the "Winoldapp" locks up, if this is the case use "Alt-Ctrl-Del"
  to bring up the "__Close Program__" dialogue, kill off the "`WinOldApp`" if it
  is not responding.

  MicroEmacs will then come back. We are looking for ways around this
  problem at the moment. From the programming perspective Windows is just
  not as nice as UNIX - which just works !!

!! me-id: amicr052
! 0ffaq11
## QUESTION (11)


  Mouse support under Microsoft windows is strange !!


## ANSWER


  The mouse operation under Microsoft windows (and DOS) is biased towards a
  3-button mouse operation (Logitech is ideal !!), operating in a similar
  way to UNIX. i.e. <select> operation gets text <Middle button> yanks text
  back.

  This stems from the fact that we all came from UNIX backgrounds. We have
  had a number of comments about this already and do plan to address this
  issue.

  __Note:-__ Those of you that have already had a little dip into the operation
  of the mouse will have probably worked out that the whole of the visible
  mouse/screen interaction is driven through macros, so this functionality
  is actually a macro change.

## QUESTION (12)


  Scroll bars too narrow !!


## ANSWER


  You can change the width of the scroll bars to double width from
  [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) "Wide Scroll Bars".  
  Alternatively, you may do this yourself from `<user>.emf` by:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable $scroll-bar &bor $scroll-bar 1

```
 
  See [$scroll-bar(5)]($scroll-bar(5)).

  Remember if you have enabled wide scroll bars, under windows, or
  X-Windows, you may want to change your start-up screen width to `82`
  characters rather than `80` - see [change-frame-width(2)](change-frame-width(2)).

## QUESTION (13)


  Tab key; Why does the tab key not operate in some windows ??


## ANSWER


  In buffers with indentation information the tab key re-computes the
  indentation of the line. This behavior may be changed from the user-setup.

  Refer to documentation for [$system(5)]($system(5)) and [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)).

## QUESTION (14)


  Termcap; On a color terminal why is there no color ??


## ANSWER


  MicroEmacs has to be enabled to show color by default. From [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3))
  enable "Termcap Color". This will give you basic colors.

  You may also try  enabling  "With  Bold" - this may  increase  the  range of
  colors.  If still  there  are no  colors  you might try to run emacs  with a
  different  terminal  setting,  for  instance  using  `TERM=xterm  me  -n` or
  `TERM=xterm me -n` or `TERM=rxvt  mec` in dependence  what type of me you are
  using.  Check if you get the color,  usually  setting  the  variable to term
  works best with regards to keys  (backspace  problems) and colors.  Settings
  might differ however in dependence to the used terminal emulator or terminal
  multiplexer.

## QUESTION (15)


  Termcap; Some of the keys do not work - how can I bind them ?


## ANSWER


  In your user setup <user>.emf add the new keys. You have to be careful as
  to the environment and probably need to do something like the following:-

```{.emf}
        ; First check we are not an Xterm
        !if &not $use-x
            ; Quick check on the terminal type. We probably need to
            ; distinguish between terminal types for different bindings
            !if &seq $TERM "myterm"
                translate-key "<from>" "<to>"
                ...
                translate-key "<from>" "<to>"
            !endif
        !endif

```

  See [translate-key(2)](translate-key(2)) for details of translating termcap keys.  
  See [describe-key(2)](describe-key(2)) to help identify the key.

  how to define new character replacements.

## QUESTION (18)


  Windows Autosave and Backup files; are these potentially a problem ?


## ANSWER


  For windows '95 up until OEM service release 2, the OS could not
  distinguish the difference between the files:-


     .xxx
     .xxx~


  on a read, we have managed to find a work around for this, however we
  would advise that the 3 letter extension is adhered to for these releases.
  For releases of '95 OEM service release 2 and greater, '98 and NT we have
  not found a problem with any of the auto save and backup naming.

  Obviously, the backup naming will depend on the native file system. For
  instance if your system administrator has not enabled long file names on
  your Novel server.

## QUESTION (21)


  Printing; My printer is not supported ?


## ANSWER


  We are in the process of providing native postscript generation - UNIX
  users can stream their output through "a2ps" and then into their standard
  printer queues.

  Windows, the support is already built in.

  For DOS then you need to get your printer manual out and sort out how to
  map the printer codes onto fonts. The printer codes are added to
  "`printer.erf`". We have already provided support for the HP DeskJet printer
  (PCL), look at this printer definition for some help as to the type of
  information that you need to set up. It's all a bit fiddley, but you do
  not get much choice if you want more than plain ASCII out.

  For releases after May 1999 then the _fontfile_ statement may be omitted as
  typically __Lucida Console__ or __Courier New__ is used. If you want to use the
  fixed OEM fonts then _fontfile_ should be defined as __app860.fon__ (or local
  language equivalent), this forces the font to be loaded as a resource,
  prior to use.

## QUESTION (24)


  Windows - Where is app850.fon ?


## ANSWER


  "app850.fon" is the font file used for the DOS window under '95/'95/NT.
  You should find it in your c: hidden. If you search from the
  Explorer->Tools->Find "app850.fon" it should be found in the fonts
  directory. There is nothing to be done - the file exists and is in the
  correct location.

  If you do not have this file then, you might have "appXXX.fon", or some
  other fixed font. You can locate the file that you want as follows:-

      Start->Settings->Control Panel->Fonts

  Display the font list as 'details'. Within that list you should find a
  "MS-DOS CPXXX" entry. It will be a red font (if you are in monochrome then
  it will have a 'A' in the box rather than a 'Tt'). This is a fixed font
  and will be a good alternative to "app850.fon", you can also try the
  "Fixedsys" font file which has some weird name.

  To be honest I do not know what Microsoft are currently shipping. Most of
  the Windows platforms that I have used have been upgrades or been abused
  by so many people you never know what is original !!

  We would be interested in any details of other fixed fonts, which support
  the full OEM character set that are better alternatives to the DOS ones.

## QUESTION (25)


  Time; mode line is showing the date in DD/MM/YY format how do I change ?


## ANSWER


  From within your user setup, over-ride the default mode line setting with
  the modifications you require. i.e. to change the date format to MM/DD/YY
  use:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable $mode-line "%s%r%u%k %b %l - %h:%m %M/%D/%Y (%e) - (%f) "

```

## QUESTION (26)


  C or C++ indentation and effects; how can I turn off ?


## ANSWER


  The C mode indentation is supposed to make editing 'C' easier, by forcing
  the user to follow a preset editing convection. The layout is pretty
  standard, following a 4 space indent, writing either K&R or standard
  'Pascal' type layout, with braces aligning vertically.

  The problem most new users have is the inability of the tab key to
  function, or more simply do not want to be 'forced' to write in a
  particular style (GNU writers will probably not like this either -
  conversely they will be using GNU emacs !!). However the constrained
  layout can be configured to create most styles and does help in a project
  situation, whereby most of the authored code roughly adheres to the same
  sort of layout conventions. For C++ users then edit "`hkcpp.emf`" rather
  than "`hkc.emf`".


## To turn off all automatic 'C' layout 


  To disable ALL automatic layout in C and C++ files then from the menu

      help -> Buffer Setup -> Setup Auto Indent


  Or from the command line __esc x buffer-setup__ and disable through the
  dialogue.

  Restart the editor.


## To re-enable the <tab> key 


  To retain the 'C' layout aid, but re-enable the tab key operation then
  disable the __Tab To Indent__ option in [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) i.e.

  __Tools__ -> __User Setup__ -> __General__ -> __Tab To Indent__

  This enables the use of the TAB key in all column positions with the
  exception of column 0. A <tab> in Column 0 will still enable the automatic
  line re-formatting.

  If you want real <Tabs> then disable the __tab__ mode using [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) i.e.

  __Tools__ -> __User Setup__ -> __General__ -> __Tab__


## To change the 'C' Indentation Layout 


  The 'C' layout indentation is controlled from the [indent(2)](indent(2)) command (see
  `hkc.emf`), the indentation level is controlled by the variables
  [$buffer-indent-width(5)]($buffer-indent-width(5)) and [$buffer-indent(5)]($buffer-indent(5)) these may be changed in the
  __Buffer Setup__ dialog.

## QUESTION (27)


  fill-paragraph function does not fill ??

  I can't seem to get the fill-paragraph function to fill the following
  paragraph:

     This is a very
     poorly formed paragraph
     which refuses to fill
     properly!


## ANSWER


  The default justification mode is Auto which tries to work out the mode
  required for each paragraph. Its fairly smart at maintaining a documents
  indentation, e.g. consider the example right hand justified:

                                                            This is a very
                                                   poorly formed paragraph
                                                     which refuses to fill
                                                                 properly!


  It will maintain this indentation. The problem comes when the detected
  form is not the required form as in the example. The detected paragraph
  justification to be used is "none" because the lines are short. There are
  2 ways to solve this problem:

  - You can change the [$fill-mode(5)]($fill-mode(5)) to left or both (in fhook-doc mode
    use C-c l or C-c b) and then use fill-paragraph as normal.
  - Manually concatenate the first few lines into one to create a longer
    first line and then use the fill-paragraph a normal, i.e. change the
    paragraph to:

     `This is a very poorly formed paragraph which refuses to fill` properly!

  and then fill. This works because the longer line will lead to a
  different assessment of what's required.

## QUESTION (28)


  Key modifier which acts as the ESC key; what is it ?

  What is the modifier key which acts as the ESC key ? Having to type ESCAPE
  and then f to move one word forward is very boring.

  With Gnu Emacs (on Unix systems), there is a "meta" modifier key which is
  a shortcut for pressing ESCAPE followed by the command key. The "meta" key
  should be the "Alt" key.


## ANSWER


  The "meta" key is the "Alt" key. But 'F' is the Main menu hot-key for the
  'File' sub-menu so by default 'A-f' will open the File sub-menu. This can
  be disabled by clearing bit 0x2000 in the $system variable. This option
  can now be set using user-setup (Alt -> Main Menu).

## QUESTION (29)


  find-file start location; where is it ?


## ANSWER


  The [find-file(2)](find-file(2)) start location is defined as follows:-

  - `*scratch*` is current buffer; the current working directory.
  - `file` is current buffer; the directory location containing _file_.

  Running under Microsoft Windows or UNIX, using an icon launch, then it may
  become frustrating that the start location is always `C:\Program`
  `Files\JASSPA\MicroEmacs` (Microsoft windows) or `/usr/local/bin` (UNIX) this
  is simply resolved by starting the executable with the __-c__ option, as
  defined by [me(1)](me(1)). The __-c__ option starts the editor with the last editing
  session, this is typically where a user will want to commence an editing
  session.

  If the __-c__ approach is not acceptable, then it is worth defining the
  environment variable `$HOME` within the start up script, or in the users
  environment. Using __find-file__ with tilde (`~`) implies that the directory
  start path is `$HOME`.

## QUESTION (30)


  Re-using a MicroEmacs session; how to ??


## ANSWER


  A MicroEmacs editing session may be re-used, such that the current editor
  is prompted to load a new file externally. This is typically invoked from
  a short-cut launch from a file manager i.e. __Explorer(1)__, __Tkdesk(1)__ etc.

  In order to facilitate the re-use of the session, then [me(1)](me(1)) is invoked
  with the __-o__ option, this locates the active editor session and passes the
  file load request. If an existing session does not exist then a new
  session is started.

  In order for this mechanism to operate, then the [Client-Server Interface](Client-Server(2))
  must be enabled from the [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) i.e.

  > [Tools -> User Setup -> Platform -> Client Server = Y]

## QUESTION (33)


  Fonts; how can I change the font ??


## ANSWER


  The currently selected font may be modified from the [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)).

  __Tools__ -> __User Setup__ -> __Platform__

  The font selection depends upon the platform, in all cases a fixed font
  should be selected, otherwise rendering anomalies will result.

  If you are running on Microsoft platforms ensure that the __OEM/ANSI__ flag
  matches the settings of the __Display Font Set__ entry.
  
  With MicroEmacs releases after 2022 you might as well use a function 
  [change-font-type(3)](change-font-type(3)) which allows you to switch the font
  in an interactive menu on X-Windows systems. You can as well use a tool like
  `xfontsel` on X-Windows systems and select a monospaced font, then pasting the
  font-string into the user-setup form field for the font name. 
  
  Per default in this menu only the fonts "Adobe Courier" and "Lucida Typwriter" 
  are available as these seem to exist on all platforms which I could test, such
  as macOS with XQuartz, Fedora and Ubuntu Linux.
  
  In case you are not  satisified  with this minimal font  selection you might
  install you own TrueType fonts, see  the information at  [faq47](faq47(0f))  -

## QUESTION (35)


  File Types; how do I interchange between UNIX, Windows and DOS files ??


## ANSWER


  MicroEmacs 2009 facilitates the editing of the standard file types on all
  platforms. All files retain their line ending type through edits. i.e. if
  a DOS file is edited on a UNIX system, the file is still written as a DOS
  file. When new files are created, they are created with the standard
  attributes of the host O/S.

  The line ending of the file may be modified from the menu

  __file__ -> __attributes__

  This brings up a dialog that allows the file type and attributes to be
  modified.

  Note that the only ending that is NOT preserved are files whose lines end
  in `<CR>`'s only. The line format is correctly interpreted on reading, but
  is not retained on the write.

## QUESTION (38)


  Some keys on my foreign keyboard do not work properly, how do I get them
  working ??


## ANSWER


  The most common problem are with foreign keyboards where the <AltGr> key
  is used to generate some characters in a similar fashion to the <Shift>
  key. For example, on a Belgian keyboard the '9' key produces a '{'
  character when the <AltGr> key is also pressed.

  The quickest and best solution is to use the __Keyboard__ setup on the
  Start-Up page of [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)). This however may not 
  provide the solution as not all keyboards are currently supported.  
  If you are using an unsupported keyboard please send configuration 
  information back to JASSPA for inclusion in the next release.   
  The keyboard configuration information is stored in the macro file `keyboard.emf`.

  If __user-setup__ does not currently support your keyboard, or you wish to
  remap some keys, then the command [translate-key(2)](translate-key(2)) should be used.  
  __translate-key__ remaps generated key stroke(s) into another key at a low
  level so the mapping is supported in all areas. If a macro and key binding
  were used instead, while they would work in the main text windows, they
  would not work in the message line. See help on __translate-key__ for more
  information.

  Note that some <AltGr> keys can produce 2 keys, for example on a Belgian
  keyboard '<AltGr>-9' produces the key 'A-C-9' first, immediately followed
  by 'A-C-{'. This is an unfortunate side effect of windows, it is better to
  have two keys rather than none. But this does add confusion to the
  problem! Again, see __translate-key__ for more information.

## QUESTION (39)


  Tabs; How to change the tab width ??


## ANSWER


  [$tab-width(5)]($tab-width(5)) controls the size of the displayed tab character
  (number of spaces) and the simulated tab character size, where the user entered tab
  character is replaced by a number of space characters. The latter is only
  used when [tab(2m)](tab(2m)) mode is enabled (it is typically enabled by default).

  To change the tab character width then the [set-variable(2)](set-variable(2)) command is
  used:

     esc x set-variable


  You will then be prompted for the remaining arguments. `<TAB>` is the
  completion so:-

     esc x set-v<TAB>
     $tab-width<TAB>
     2


  If this is the setting that you always want to use then it is easier if
  you put this in your <user.emf> as:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable $tab-width 2

```

  then whenever you start a new session you will always have the `$tab-width`
  defined as you want it.

  If you are reading in a file with TAB's embedded then you can convert all
  of the <TAB>'s to spaces using [tabs-to-spaces(3)](tabs-to-spaces(3)):

     esc x tabs-to-spaces

## QUESTION (42)


  tags; How do I generate a MicroEmacs compatible tags file ??


## ANSWER


  A __tags__ file is used by the [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2)) command. This is used to hypertext
  to the _tagged_ definition or variable. The standard __ctags(1)__ format is used
  by MicroEmacs. The __tags__ file itself may be generated by MicroEmacs 2009
  from the menu (_Tools->XX Tools->Create Tags File_). Alternatively a __tags__
  file may be generated by the __ctags(1)__ utility. This is typically standard
  on UNIX platforms. For Windows and DOS platforms then the __Exuberant Ctags__
  is recommended, this is available from:-

      http://darren.hiebert.com

  A MicroEmacs 2009 compatible tags file may be generated using the command
  line "`ctags -N --format=1 ."` cataloging the current directory. To generate
  __tags__ for a directory tree then use "`ctags -NR --format=1 .`". Refer to the
  __Exuberant Ctags__ documentation for a more detailed description of the
  utility.

  The user variable [%tag-option(5)](%tag-option(5)) may be used to enable [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2)) to
  locate a recursivelly generated __tags__ file from a parent directory.

## QUESTION (43)


  ne; how can I enable line wrapping in NE ??


## ANSWER


  The line wrapping feature is controlled by the wrap buffer-mode in ME but
  this feature is omitted in NE. To get the size of NE down many features
  have to be disabled including the wrap mode and fill-paragraph.

  To enable then you have to build your own version of NE with this enabled
  by changing the 2nd MEOPT_WORDPRO settings in "emain.h" to 1.
  Alternatively rename your ne.emf to me.emf and use 'me' instead of ne.

  Once it is built and you want to edit a text file then you need to enable
  WRAP and INDENT mode in the buffer for it to behave correctly. WRAP does
  the wrap to the next line and INDENT maintains the left indentation.
  fill-paragraph is present.

## QUESTION (44)


  Why is MicroEmacs called MicroEmacs 09 in 2024 ??


## ANSWER

  MicroEmacs was mainly developed by John Green and Steven Phillips in the 1990ies
  and in the 2010s. The last official release was in 2009. Since then the development
  was stalled mainly do to the closing of yahoogroups as the communication was lost
  within the small user base. On Github are a few forks which did some fixes but which
  were not coordinated. Currently the branch at https://github.com/mittelmark/microemacs
  is the one which is developed. As there exists another newer branch with more features
  like https, SVN and Git support I (Detlef Groth) decided to stick with the old name
  MicroEmacs and add the last release years at the end. So the versions will stick with
  09 to distinguish it from the new version which will be hopefully released in 2024 as
  MicroEmacs 24. So the versioning scheme of this MicroEmacs is v09.12.XX - where I will
  count up the XX from 23 to 31 of neccessary. Currently we (Steven Phillips and me)
  focus on the release of MicroEmacs 24. MicroEmacs 09 will contain just bug fixes.

  The last official 09 release from 2009 can be download from http://www.jasspa.com -

## QUESTION (45)


  What are the main new features of MicroEmacs 09 in 2024 ??  


## ANSWER


  MicroEmacs  09 in 2024  contains  a few fixes to  compile it with the modern
  GCC. It provides the following new features (often added by Steven  Phillips
  to the new MicroEmacs 24 (which is not published yet) and then backported by
  me to MicroEmacs 09):
  
  - in terminal mode on Unix using the alternate buffer feature which supports
    suspension  without editor traces, so the buffer clears during  suspension
    with Ctrl-z
  - fixing frame resize on X-Windows which might before destroy the window layout
    on some tiling window managers
  - better font support on X11 using true type fonts as well as the old pixmaps fonts
  - simplified font selection on X-windows using [change-font-type(3)](change-font-type(3))
  - font-resize with Ctrl-Plus and Ctrl-Minus
  - support for  Windows-cp1252  encodings if the font  supports it, so you an
    get an Euro symbol ...,  Windows-cp1250  (Central European - Polish, Czech
    etc) and Windows-cp1251  (Cyrillian) are as well now available if the user
    has a monospaced font with these encodings
  - more editor schemes, mainly interesting Dracula and Ayu-Light schemes 
  - improved template handling using an interactive menu to select templates
    from the users config directory (.jasspa in your HOME directory), create a
    subfolder r for R templates and place your etf files there
  - new binary builds for macOS 11-14 (as well as for Windows and Ubuntu and Fedora Linuxes)
  - much improved C++, Python, R and Markdown mode, support for highlighting R
    or Python  code chunks in Markdown documents
  - improved CUA bindings - shortcut emulation more common in standard GUI
    applications like C-c, C-x, C-v for copy, cut and paste 
  - new [jeany-bindings(3)](jeany-bindings(3)) command which supports a few CUA bindings
    after the C-j prefix so copy, cut and paste are `C-j C-c`, `C-j C-x` and `C-j C-v`.

## QUESTION (46)

 
  What is a bfs executuable?
  
  Here the text from John Green from the MicroEmacs website from 2009:
  
  The  motivation  behind  this  latest  development  was to  produce  a fully
  featured  version  of JASSPA  MicroEmacs  which  included  all of the macros
  (which do most of the work) in a single  executable  package  that  could be
  transported to different systems without  installing  anything. i.e. copy it
  onto the system and run it.  Secondly  we  realised  that we also  wanted to
  customise the macros contained within such that we could carry round our own
  extensions but did not necessarily want to re-build the binary as the target
  systems we wanted to run on might not  contain  all of the  necessary  build
  tools and libraries to re-build the image. Thirdly  anything we added to the
  executable must contain a hierarchical file structure and must be a platform
  independent  format which may be constructed and manipulated on any platform
  whilst being space efficient.

  The  solution  was to  obviously  tack the  information  onto the end of the
  executable as we know where the  executable  is. The next problem was how to
  append  information  onto the  executable  that we can  retrieve at runtime.
  There was obviously  conventional  archive formats, but they are not so good
  at run-time traversal, in addition there were no tools to add and remove the
  archive. A cat would of course append  information to the end of a file, but
  removal  is much more  difficult.  In the end we came up with a new  archive
  format that performed with conventional file system commands such as listing
  a directory  and reading files in addition  added  compression  such that we
  could  efficiently  reduce the size of the data  attachment.  Given that the
  archive is being  placed at the bottom of the  executable  then the  archive
  must be located  from the bottom. The end result is a built-in  file  system
  format  called bfs, this in  hindsight  was  probably not a really good name
  because it conflicts with the BEoS file system  (latterly we have settled on
  the Tacky  (Tacked-on)  File  System or tfs but have yet to perform the name
  space move).

  The bfs command line utility is used to manipulate the archive and attach it
  to the  executable,  its basic  operation is outlined  below. The  following
  examples  use me.exe as a clearer  example of which item is the  executable.
  Obviously  in a UNIX type  environment  then the .exe suffix is not used and
  does not exist.

  To build a bfs archive then simply  unpack the metree and remove things that
  you do not want in the archive:

       % tar zxvf jasspa-metree-20091017.tar.gz
       % rm -rf ./jasspa/pixmaps        # Delete the pixmaps not required.
       % rm -rf  ./jasspa/spelling      # Delete the empty spelling directory.
       % rm -rf  ./jasspa/company       # Delete the empty company directory.
       % rm -f ./jasspa/macros/null     # Delete the null file.
            
  You can add new things  such as a spelling  dictionary,  some of your  private
  files etc. DO NOT add the dynamic  files such as user.erf or the session files
  as the archive is READ-ONLY and cannot write back any saved session or history
  information.

  Build the  archive  and add to an  executable  from a different  directory  to
  create a new executable with BFS archive attached:

       % bfs -a mypath/mecw.exe -o me.exe ./jasspa
    
  Append an already existing archive to the executable:

       % bfs -a mypath/mecw.exe -o me.exe jasspa-metree-20091117.bfs
    
  This  should now be a stand alone  executable.  If you append  again it will
  remove the old archive and add a new one.

  The archive may be updated in place using  either a directory  or a .bfs file.
  This will  remove the  existing  archive and replace it with the new  archive.
  i.e.

       % bfs -a me.exe ./jasspa          # Add a new archive from directory.
       % bfs -a me.exe jasspa.bfs        # Add a pre-built archive.
      
  You can list the archive attached to the executable:

       % bfs -l me.exe
    
  You can test the archive attached to the executable:

       % bfs -t me.exe
    
  You can get some information on the archive attached to the executable:

       % bfs -i me.exe
    
  You can remove (or strip) the archive attached to the executable:

       % bfs -s me.exe
    
  You can extract the archive  attached to the executable which will extract the
  directory tree in the archive to a new directory called oldarch.

       % bfs -x oldarch me.exe        # Extract to directory called "oldarch"
       % bfs -f oldarch.bfs me.exe    # Extract to a file called "oldarch.bfs"
      
  We  mentioned in the preamble  that bfs is  architecture  independent  and a
  little  endian Linux  executable or big endian Sun sparc  executable  may be
  safely manipulated and appended by a Windows version of bfs, and vice versa.
  bfs treats all files as binary hence care should be taken with line endings,
  although  MicroEmacs is not directly  affected by the different  line ending
  forms.

## Customizing the executable

  The standard bfs archive built by JASSPA contains the standard macros but no
  customization  so when a user  wishes  to bundle  their  macros  and  common
  extensions the following steps outline how to do it.

  Firstly lets assume that the user starts from the supplied attached archive,
  the first thing to do is to extract it and then modify it.

        % bfs -x myarch me.exe      # Extract to directory called "myarch"
    
  The extracted tree will have two directories:

        myarch/macros
        myarch/contrib
      
  Assuming that the user wants to add a spelling dictionary, then create a new
  directory called spelling and place the required  spelling  dictionary files
  in this new  directory (we selected the US  dictionary  here). Note that you
  can include more than one spelling dictionary file set in here:

       % mkdir myarch/spelling
       % (cd myarch/spelling; tar zxvf pathto/ls_enus.tar.gz)
      
  If you have some company wide files then create a directory  called  company
  and place the macro files into this directory:

      % mkdir myarch/company
      % cp pathto/companyfiles* myarch/company
      
  If you have your own private  extensions then it is suggested that you place
  these at the top level i.e. in the myarch  directory.  Note that the private
  files  include  a user  name  component  so some may not be found if you are
  logged in as a different  user, so consider  carefully the files to transfer
  across. DO NOT place any  dynamic  files into the archive as it is read only
  i.e.  user.erf as these cannot be written. It is strongly  recommended  that
  the files in the  myarch/macros are not changed as this enables user changes
  that do not work to be  easily  backed  out;  placing  a file in the  myarch
  directory  is  used  in  preference  to, and  overrides,  the  same  file in
  myarch/macros.

       % cp pathto/myfiles* myarch
    
  With the archive  directory  composed  then we simply add it to the end of the
  executable, this operation displaces any old archive with the new one:

       % bfs -a me.exe ./myarch
    
  Now  when  you run the  executable  it will  contain  the  archive  that you
  constructed.  Note that the  attached  archive is last in the search path so
  any macro  files  found in the file  system in the normal  search  path will
  override the same macro files that exist in the archive.

  
## Accessing  the file  system  from within  MicroEmacs

  The bfs file  system is  accessible  from  within  MicroEmacs  using the URL
  bfs://. The directory location may be traversed by the user and files may be
  copied out and executed within the editor from this location. i.e.

        C-x C-f bfs://
    
  results in a directory listing of the file system:

        Directory listing of: bfs://
        4833  used in 0 files and 4 dirs (Not-Filtered)
    
        Attr    Size             Modified Name
        dr-x      21  2009/11/21 18:16:38 ../
        dr-x     152  2009/11/21 18:16:38 contrib/
        dr-x    4639  2009/11/21 18:16:38 macros/
          
  Note that the bfs://  location  is  automatically  placed on the file search
  path in the colon  separated  list and is  referenced  as {bfs} in the colon
  separated search path list.

## Known Issues


  JASSPA MicroEmacs is not starting up in a X-Windows mode on Fedora 11/12 and
  possibly some other RedHat  systems. On executing me then it silently  fails
  to start. The reason for this is that the  built-in  default  font cannot be
  resolved. In order to fix this then the following steps may be taken:

  Create a file .Xresources in the $HOME directory if it does not already exist.
  Add the line


        MicroEmacs*font: -*-fixed-medium-r-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

  to the .Xresources file.

  Merge the local resources definitions to the XServer with the command:

        % xrdb -merge $HOME/.Xresources

  After  performing  these  steps then any  pre-built  MicroEmacs  will run up
  correctly and not silently fail. If you wish to re-build the binary with the
  default font then edit unixterm.c::2976 and change the default font string.

## QUESTION (47)

  How can I use True Type Fonts within MicroEmacs on a X11 system ??  
  
  Wheras  in the  terminal  you use your  terminal  emulator  to choose a nice
  looking font, for the  X11-Windows  application  you are on your own. If you
  are on  Linux  with an X11  server  the  availability  of  fonts  to be used
  directly within  MicroEmacs is first rather limited and restricted mostly to Bitmap
  fonts like misc-fixed or or -bitstream-courier.. To graphically  explore
  the available  fonts you can use a tool like xfontsel.  Using an other tool,
  mkfontscale, you can however index as well True or Open Type Fonts to be
  used  within  X11  applications.  You can  place  your ttf and otf fonts for
  instance  in the  `~/fonts`  folder  within  your  home  directory  and  run
  thereafter the tools mkfontscale, mkfontdir and xset like this:
  
        cd ~/.fonts
        mkfontdir .         # indexing filenames
        mkfontscale .       # indexing encodings
        xset +fp `pwd`      # extend the font search path
        xset fp rehash      # let the X-server know about
  
  In case of trouble you can reset the font search path to the original search
  path by writing this:

        xset fp default
        xset fp rehash

  You can now inspect the file  fonts.dir  to see the  available  font strings
  usuable by X11 applications:
  
  For instance my fonts.dir contains the line:
  
      CCONSOLA.TTF -microsoft-consolas-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-m-0-microsoft-cp1252

  Indicating that I can use this font with a cp1252 encodingm the extended ISO
  encoding by  Microsoft.  I can write this string into the user setup  dialog
  together  with a fontsize  which  should  come  directly  after the two minus
  digits:
  
      CCONSOLA.TTF -microsoft-consolas-medium-r-normal--22-0-0-0-m-0-microsoft-cp1252
    
  Selecting  Windows  ANSI as the  character  set  allows me to use the extend
  character set within my  application. If you use "esc x  insert-symbol"  you
  see for instance that the Euro symbol is available.
  
  On the Github  project  page,  https://github.com/mittelmark/microemacs  you
  will find a download link for some indexed monospaced TTF fonts.

## QUESTION (48)
  
  How to work with the terminal version of MicroEmacs on terminals with UTF-8
  encoding?
  
  If you run the terminal  version of  MicroEmacs  the character  encodings are
  defined  by the  terminal  emulator.  For some of them  (like Mate or Gnome
  terminal)  you can  change  the font  encodings  using a menu,  others  like
  LX-terminal the terminal multiplexer like tmux - only support
  Unicode  encodings. If you work with MicroEmacs on such a terminal, the display
  of non-ASCII characters might behave weird. There are two ways to fix this issue:
  
  - switch  the  current  font  encoding  for  your  terminal if possible, let's
    say to ISO-8859-1 or ISO-8859-15 or what ever you need ... or
  - run a  tool  like  `luit` - https://invisible-island.net/luit/luit-figures.html
    as a  wrapping  application  which  sits  between  MicroEmacs  and the terminal
    emulator  and  translates all codes  from and  to  Unicode between these two 
    applications.
    
  Here an example on how to do this:
  
  > `TERM=xterm luit -encoding ISO-8859-15 mec`
  
  Or write at the end `me -n` if you use a mecw executuable. The TERM=xterm
  prefix should enable the colored version in the terminal as well as described
  in [faq14](faq14(0f)).
  
  
  The `luit` application should be available by your package manager, so it
  should be installable as:
  
       sudo dnf install luit        ## fedora  
       sudo apt install x11-utils   ## debian based
       sudo pacman -S   luit        ## arch based   
       sudo pkg install luit        ## freebsd
                                    ## windows-cygwin  

  You can as well create an alias for the luit-me command ensemble:       
  
  >  aliasc me-iso-15="TERM=xterm luit -encoding ISO-8859-15 mec"
  
  One  disadvantage  of using `luit` is, that you can't suspend MicroEmacs if running
  it within  `luit`. To get  suspension  you might use  another  tools  called
  abduco which allows you to suspend a terminal session in in principle. Aduco
  is as well a standard  tool on Linux  systems  which  should be  installable
  using your package manager like thist:
  
       sudo dnf install abduco      ## fedora, redhat system
       sudo apt install abduco      ## debian based systems
       sudo pacman -S   abduco      ## arch based systems
       sudo pkg install abduco      ## freebsd system

  After you have  installed  abduco and luit you might  create a little  shell
  function or a shell script like this:
  
       #!/usr/bin/env bash
       ## file mecu 
       tty=$(tty | grep -Eo '[0-9]+')
       TERM=xterm abduco -A -e ^z mec$tty luit -encoding ISO559-15 mecb "$@"

  This little wrapper function will either attach an existing session on your
  current  terminal  or  create  a new one. You  might  replace  the  encoding
  ISO8859-15  with an encoding more  appropriate to your system. Make the file
  executable and move it to your bin folder.

## QUESTION (50)

  How can I use other popular editor color themes in MicroEmacs?
  
  Importinng  other editor themes is not that  difficult. You can quite easily
  create  existing  color schemes for dark mode using the default color scheme
  "Default White on Black". If you go to the Github project page:
  https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes you find there downloads
  for the terminal 
  https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/blob/master/dynamic-colors
  as shell scripts and for an X11-session as xrdb-files.  
  
  For the terminal just choose the shell script of your choice and execute it before
  your start you MicroEmacs terminal version. You should use the standard MicroEmacs
  theme "Default White on Black" as it mostly compatible with the shell script themes.
  
  So a terminal session could look like this:
  
       source /path/to/neobones_light.sh    
       mecb  
  
  Usually  dark themes work better than light  themes.  Light themes only work
  with  the  default  theme if color 0 and 8 are set to light  colors.  If you
  background  is dark for a white  theme you can try out the  Scheme  "Termcap
  (White)" which fits quite nicely for light themes
   
  For the X11 GUI  MicroEmacs  a scheme file should be  generated.  There is a
  little shell script  xrdb2scheme.sh  in the Github bin folder which can be used
  to convert xrdb files into MicroEmacs color scheme code:
  
       bash bin/xrdb2scheme.sh  /path/to/xrdb-file
       
  will  print  out the  color  creation  code for a scheme  file. Use the file
  `schemeat.emf`  (the Artur theme) as template,  replace the color lines from
  color 1 to 21 with code printed to the  terminal,  give the theme a new name
  which is shown in the  description  part on top.  Color  1-16 are the  usual
  terminal  themes,  (black, red, green,  yellow,  blue,  purple, cyan, white)
  first full then bright versions, color 17 is the background  color, color 18
  is the foreground  color, color 19 is the cursor color, color 20 is the text
  selection  background  color  and color 21 is the text  selection  foregound
  color.
  
  Here an example session:
  
       $ bash bin/xrdb2scheme.sh ~/Downloads/Github-Dark.sh 
       add-color &set .col1 1 0 0 0          ; ansi color 0  (black) 
       add-color &set .col2 2 247 129 102    ; ansi color 1  (red)   
       add-color &set .col3 3 86 211 100     ; ansi color 2  (green) 
       add-color &set .col4 4 227 179 65     ; ansi color 3  (yellow)
       add-color &set .col5 5 108 164 248    ; ansi color 4  (blue)  
       add-color &set .col6 6 219 97 162     ; ansi color 5  (purple)
       add-color &set .col7 7 43 116 137     ; ansi color 6  (cyan)  
       add-color &set .col8 8 255 255 255    ; ansi color 7  (white) 
       add-color &set .col9 9 77 77 77       ; ansi color 8  (brightblack) 
       add-color &set .col10 10 247 129 102  ; ansi color 9  (brightred)   
       add-color &set .col11 11 86 211 100   ; ansi color 10 (brightgreen) 
       add-color &set .col12 12 227 179 65   ; ansi color 11 (brightyellow)
       add-color &set .col13 13 108 164 248  ; ansi color 12 (brightblue)  
       add-color &set .col14 14 219 97 162   ; ansi color 13 (brightpurple)
       add-color &set .col15 15 43 116 137   ; ansi color 14 (brightcyan)  
       add-color &set .col16 16 255 255 255  ; ansi color 15 (brightwhite)
       add-color &set .col17 17 16 18 22     ; background          
       add-color &set .col18 18 139 148 158  ; foreground         
       add-color &set .col19 19 201 209 217  ; cursor color       
       add-color &set .col20 20 59 80 112    ; selection background
       add-color &set .col21 21 255 255 255  ; selection foreground
    
  These color defintions could be placed in the color scheme file using
  one of the Ayu schemes (schemead.emf - dark theme, schemeale.emf - 
  light theme)  as templates. Usually there is then some tweaking 
  required aftwards in the [scheme-editor(3)](scheme-editor(3)).
  
  You can as well create a function like `scheme-github-dark`
  in your `username.emf` file where at the beginning you load  either 
  the schemefile `schemead.emf` or `schemeal.emf` files using the execute
  file command and at the end doing a screen-update. 
  So the code would look like this:
  
       define-macro scheme-github-dark
          execute-file "schemead"
          ... color codes from above
          screen-update
       !emacro
  
  You can then execute this function and get the color scheme in your 
  current editor session. Please note that this is then not a regular 
  scheme file, so the scheme can't be edited using the scheme-editor
  only by changing the colors in your `username.emf` file.

  As an alternative you can since ME version 0924b2 directly load 
  rdb files without converting them into a ME scheme file. 
  See [xrdb-scheme(3)](xrdb-scheme(3)) for details.

## DESCRIPTION


  __MicroEmacs 2009__ is a cut down version of the EMACS text editor, based on
  Daniel Lawrences MicroEmacs. __MicroEmacs 2009__ is a tool for creating and
  changing documents, programs, and other text files. It is both relatively
  easy for the novice to use, but also very powerful in the hands of an
  expert. MicroEmacs 2009 can be extensively customized for the needs of the
  individual user.

  __MicroEmacs 2009__ allows multiple files to be edited at the same time. The
  screen may be split into different windows and screens, and text may be
  moved freely from one window on any screen to the next. Depending on the
  type of file being edited, __MicroEmacs 2009__ can change how it behaves to
  make editing simple. Editing standard text files, program files and word
  processing documents are all possible at the same time.

  There are extensive capabilities to make word processing and editing
  easier. These include commands for string searching and replacing,
  paragraph reformatting and deleting, automatic word wrapping, word move
  and deletes, easy case controlling, and automatic word counts.

  For complex and repetitive editing tasks editing macros can be written.
  These macros allow the user a great degree of flexibility in determining
  how __MicroEmacs 2009__ behaves. Also, any and all the commands can be used by
  any key stroke by changing, or re-binding, what commands various keys
  invoke.

  Special features are also available to perform a diverse set of operations
  such as file encryption, automatic backup file generation, en-tabbing and
  de-tabbing lines, executing operating system commands and filtering of
  text through other programs.

  The command line options to __MicroEmacs 2009__ are defined as follows:-

  @__startFile__ Initialize MicroEmacs 2009 using _startFile_[__.emf__]. 
  
  > The default when omitted is __me.emf__. See [start-up(3)](start-up(3)) and [Command Line Filters](Command Line Filters) for more
    information.

  __-__ Pipe _stdin_ into buffer __*stdin*__, when the buffer is saved the output is
    written _stdout_. 
    
  > Following is a simple example which changes '`a`'s to '`b`'s:

```{.emf}
    define-macro start-up
        find-buffer "*stdin*"
        beginning-of-buffer
        replace-string "a" "b"
        save-buffer
        quick-exit
    !emacro
```
 
  > This can be used in the following manner:

        me "@testpipe.emf" < foo.a > foo.b


  > See __-p__ for disabling user interaction and the help page for command
    [ml-write(2)](ml-write(2)) for a further example.

  __-a__  Toggle the auto-save mode, this toggles the [auto(2m)](auto(2m)) mode.

  >  __Note:__ that NanoEmacs disables auto save mode by default and MicroEmacs
     enables auto save mode by default. The behavior of __-a__ is therefore
     different between the two editors.

  __-b__  Load next file as a binary file (binary editor mode, uses [binary(2m)](binary(2m))
     buffer mode).

  __-B__ Toggle the backup mode, this toggles the [backup(2m)](backup(2m)) mode.

  > __Note:__ that NanoEmacs disables backup mode by default and MicroEmacs
    enables backup mode by default. The behavior of __-B__ is therefore
    different between the two editors.

  __-c__[_sessionName_] Continuation mode. 
  
  > Load the __MicroEmacs 2009__ last edit session,
    restoring the buffers to their previous loaded state when history mode
    is enabled. The __-c__ option is generally used with windowing interfaces
    (X-Windows/Microsoft Windows) as the shortcut icon invocation.

  > If the optional session name _sessionName_ is specified then the session
    file _sessionName___.esf__ is loaded restoring the previous editing session
    including the buffer window size, position and layout, the buffer mark
    and cursor location, main window size. When the _sessionName_ includes
    space characters then the command line option should be bracketed e.g.
    `"-cFoo Bar"`. On a session restore then no additional files to load
    should be included on the command line as this will not enable the
    original window configuration to be restored as the window
    configuration will change. See [read-session(3)](read-session(3)) for further
    information.

  > If the _sessionName_ is omitted then the default session file
    _username___.esf__ is loaded (see [esf(8)](esf(8))) restoring the previously loaded
    buffers however the window layout and position is not restored. The
    default _sessionName_ is the login name [$MENAME(5)]($MENAME(5)).

  __-h__ Show the help page (does not start the editor).

  __-i__ MS-DOS versions of __MicroEmacs 2009__ only. Insert the contents of the
   current screen into the __*scratch*__ buffer

  __-k__[_key_] Load next file as an encrypted file (uses [crypt(2m)](crypt(2m)) buffer mode). 
  
  > The optional adjoining argument can be used to specify the decrypting key,
    if this argument is not specify the user will be prompted for it on
    start-up.

  __-l___lineNo_[__:___column_] Go to line _lineNo_ in the next given file and 
      optionally to the specified column number. 

  > The column may be omitted if not required.
    typically used with utilities such a __more(1)__ where an external editor
    may be invoked from other viewer.

  __-m__*command* Sends a [client-server](Client-Server(2)) command to an existing MicroEmacs session. 
  
  > The  command takes the form "__C:__*<client>:<command>*" i.e. 
    to write "Hello World" on the message line then a client may issue the command:-

         ; launch server
         me &
         ; send message
         me -m "C:ME:ml-write \"Hello world\""


  > Note that the _<command>_ is a MicroEmacs macro command, the escape
    sequences must be adhered to. The _client-server_ interface is typically
    used to load a file, this may be performed as follows:-

         me -m "C:myutility:find-file \"/path/foo.bar\""


  > The absolute path is specified in this type of transaction as the
    current working directory of the active MicroEmacs session is unknown.
    The __-m__ option de-iconize's the existing editor session and bring it to
    the foreground.

  __-n__ Console mode

  > UNIX X-Windows environments only and MicroSoft Windows NT console
    versions. Execute __MicroEmacs 2009__ using termcap rather than X-Windows
    for UNIX; typically used within an __xterm__ shell to fire up MicroEmacs
    2009 for a quick edit. For Microsoft Windows, a console window is
    started as opposed to a GUI window.

  __-o__*<file>* - use running version of ME
  
  > Use already running version of MicroEmacs 2009 to load the _<file>_, if
    it exists, otherwise start a new editor session. This uses the
    _client-server_ interface to push the new file into the existing editor
    session. Refer to the [Client-Server Interface](Client-Server(2)) for details.

  __-p__
  > Used with the __-__ which inputs from _stdin_ and disables user interaction
    within MicroEmacs. To debug then the __-P__ option may be used to enable
    debug on _stderr_. See the help pages for commands [ml-write(2)](ml-write(2)) and
    [command-wait(2)](command-wait(2)) for examples of this option's use.

  __-P__
  
  > Used with the __-p__ option and is used for debugging the pipe mode,
    [ml-write(2)](ml-write(2)) messages are displayed on stderr.

  __-R__
  
  > Reverse the default video color scheme. The default foreground color
    becomes the background color and vice versa. This only affects the
    built in scheme and not any schemes defined in any start-up file.

  __-r__
  
  > Read-only, all buffers will be in view mode

  __-s___string_
  
  > Search for string "_string_" in the current buffer. e.g. `me -sfoo bar`
    starts __MicroEmacs 2009__, loads file `bar` and initiates a search for _foo_.
    The cursor is left at the end of the string if located, otherwise at
    the top of the buffer.

  __-u___username_
  
  > Set the current user name [$user-name(5)]($user-name(5)) to _username_ before MicroEmacs
    is initialized.

  __-v___variable=string_
  
  > Assign the MicroEmacs 2009 _variable_ with _string_. The assignment is
    performed before the buffers are loaded. Typically used to change the
    start-up characteristics of the startup file(s).

  __-V__
  
  > Print the name and version of MicroEmacs. i.e.

       `orac% me -V`
       `MicroEmacs 06 - Date 2006/08/10 - sunos`

  __-x__
  
  > UNIX environments. Disable the capture of signals. __MicroEmacs 2009__ by
    default captures an handles all illicit signal interrupts. The option
    is enabled when debugging the source code allowing exception
    conditions to be trapped within the debugger.

  __-y__
  
  > Load next file as a reduced binary file (uses [rbin(2m)](rbin(2m)) buffer mode).


## ENVIRONMENT


  The following environment variables are used by __MicroEmacs 2009__.

  __DISPLAY__
  
  > UNIX environments running X-Windows only. The identity of the
    X-Windows server. Typically set to __unix:0.0__, refer to the X-Windows
    documentation for details of this environment variable.

  __MENAME__
  
  > [$MENAME(5)]($MENAME(5)) is used to override the identity of the user [$user-name(5)]($user-name(5)).
    The variable may be used to determine which start-up configuration to
    use in the initialization of __MicroEmacs 2009__ (_$user-name_.erf). This is
    ignored if the __-u__ option is specified on the command line.

  > Non-UNIX platforms usually need to explicitly set the __$MENAME__
    environment variable to identify the aforementioned files. for MS-DOS
    and early versions of Microsoft Windows this is typically performed in
    the `AUTOEXEC.BAT` file.

  __PATH__
  
  > The __$PATH__ environment variable is used on most operating systems as a
    search path for executable files. This __$PATH__ environment variable must
    be defined with __MicroEmacs 2009__ on the search path. Under UNIX this is
    set in the `.login`, `.cshrc` or `.profile` file i.e.

          export PATH $PATH:/usr/name/me

  > Within MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows environments it is defined in the
    `AUTOEXEC.BAT` file. e.g.

          set PATH=%PATH%;c:\me

  > __MicroEmacs 2009__ utilizes information in the __$PATH__ environment variable
    to locate the start-up files, dictionaries etc.

  __TERM__
  
  > The terminal identification sting. In UNIX environments the
    environment variable __$TERM__ is set to "`vt...`", in this case it is
    assumed that the machine is a server, and the host cannot support X
    (see command line option __-n__).

  > In MS-DOS the environment variable is usually set to define the
    graphics adapter mode. __%TERM__ is assigned a string, understood by the
    `me.emf` start-up file, to set the graphics mode. Predefined strings
    include:-

  >  __E80x50__  
  
  >  Initiates an 80 column by 50 line screen.

  >  __E80x25__  
  
  >  Initiates an 80 column by 25 line screen.

  >  _userDefined_  
  
  >  A user defined string to set an explicit graphics card mode. The
     operation is dependent upon the support offered by the graphics
     adapter.

  __MEINSTALLPATH__
  
  > [$MEINSTALLPATH(5)]($MEINSTALLPATH(5)) is an environment variable that overrides any
    internally defined search path for MicroEmacs system macros and
    defines the root directory(s) of the MicroEmacs system macros. The
    presence of the environment variable affects [$search-path(5)]($search-path(5)).

  __MEUSERPATH__
  
  > [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)) is an environment variable that defines the users
    private directory where user configuration files such as
    [$user-name]($user-name(5)).emf, [$user-name]($user-name(5)).erf and personal spelling dictionaries are
    stored. This is an absolute directory path. The environment variable
    sets the MicroEmacs variable [$user-path(5)]($user-path(5)).

  __MEPATH__
  
  > [$MEPATH(5)]($MEPATH(5)) is an environment variable that may be used to define the
    absolute search path for MicroEmacs macro files and affects the
    setting of __$search-path__. The path should include the system macros
    location(s) and should include the user directory location
    [$user-path(5)]($user-path(5)) as the first path when the environment variable
    [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)) is not defined. If $MEUSERPATH is defined then this
    path name appears before the __$MEPATH__ variable to define the user
    directory location. __$MEPATH__ is not searching, so ALL directories to be
    searched must be included in the path specification.

  > [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)) is the preferred method used to defined the user
     directory.

  __INFOPATH__
  
  > MicroEmacs 2009 uses the environment variable __$INFOPATH__ as the
    directory(s) used to search for GNU __Info__ files. Within the UNIX
    __$INFOPATH__ is a semi-colon separated list of directories which are used
    to search for the MicroEmacs 2009 macro files. The path is searched
    from left to right. The environment variable is typically defined in
    the in the `.login`, `.cshrc` or `.profile` file i.e.

          export INFOPATH /usr/local/info:$HOME/info

  > The default when omitted is `/usr/local/info`.

  > Within MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows environments it is defined in the
    `AUTOEXEC.BAT` file. e.g.

          set MEPATH=c:\usr\local\info

  > There is no default location in these environments. For Microsoft
    Windows environments refer to [me32.ini(8)](me32.ini(8)) for a method of setting up
    the __$INFOPATH__ from the windows configuration file.


## FILES


  All of the macro files and dictionaries are located in the __MicroEmacs__ home
  directory. The standard file extensions that are utilized are:-

  __.eaf__
  
  >  __MicroEmacs 2009__ abbreviation file, defines completion definitions for
     buffer dependent text expansion.

  __.edf__
  
  >  A __MicroEmacs 2009__ spelling dictionary. _<language>___.edf__ provide language
     specific dictionaries; _$LOGNAME___.edf__ is personal spelling dictionary.

  __.ehf__   
  
  >  __MicroEmacs 2009__ help file information. On-line help information for
     emacs, the main file is `me.ehf`.

  __.emf__
  
  >  A __MicroEmacs 2009__ macro file. The following classes of macro file
     exist:

  >  __me.emf__
  
  >  The default startup file.

  > <platform>.emf_
    A platform specify startup file, these include UNIX generic
       (unixterm.emf), UNIX specific (irix.emf, hpux.emf, unixwr1.emf,
       linux.emf, sunos.emf etc), Microsoft Windows (win32.emf), MS-DOS
       (dos.emf).

  >  __hkxxxxxx.emf__
  
  >  Buffer context specific hook files to initialize a buffer with
     macros and highlighting appropriate to the contents of the file
     type. e.g. 'C' language editing (hkc.emf), N/Troff typesetting
     (hknroff.emf), UNIX Manual page display (hkman.emf), Makefiles
     (hkmake.emf), etc.

  __.erf__
  
  >  Registry files, used to retain personal information, users history in
     the file etc.

  __.etf__
  
  >  Template files used to seed new files. Typically contains standard
     header information, copyright notices etc. that are placed at the head
     of files. The 'C' programming language is called `c.etf`

## USER FILES

  - ~/.jasspa/username.eaf  - MicroEmacs user abbreviation file
  - ~/.jasspa/username.eff  - MicroEmacs user favorites file
  - ~/.jasspa/username.emf  - MicroEmacs user configuration and macro file
  - ~/.jasspa/username.enf  - MicroEmacs user notes file
  - ~/.jasspa/username.erf  - MicroEmacs user registry file
  - ~/.jasspa/username.esf  - MicroEmacs user session file
  - ~/.jasspa/langname.etf  - MicroEmacs programming language template file


## MICROSOFT WINDOWS


  Microsoft Windows environments should refer to [me32.ini(8)](me32.ini(8)) for a method of
  setting up the environment variables without editing the `AUTOEXEC.BAT`
  configuration file.

  Drag and drop support is provided in the Windowing version of MicroEmacs.
  The editor window is brought into focus following the drop.


## UNIX


  Xdnd drag and drop support is provided in the X-Windows version of
  MicroEmacs. The editor window is not raised or brought into focus
  following the drop as expected in the UNIX environment.


## SESSIONS


  Reading a session is generally performed when a MicroEmacs session is
  started using the "__-c__" command line option rather than from the mode line
  or main menu, see [read-session(3)](read-session(3)). Invoking

  __me -c__*<mySessionName>*

  > where _<mySessionName>_ is the name of the session (the [$MENAME(5)]($MENAME(5)) or system
    login name) will restore all of of the buffers, windows layout, point and
    mark positions, main window size etc. at the point of the last shut down.
    e.g. given a system login name of _jasspa_ then

  __me -c__*jasspa*

  > restores the session to the state when _jasspa_ last exited MicroEmacs. When
    the session name is specified then no other files should be specified, so
    the command line

  __me -c___jasspa_ `morefiles.txt`

  > restores the buffers but does not restore the window layout because this
    has been destroyed by the introduction of the new file "`morefiles.txt`".
   This type of command with another file behaves as the old "`me -c`" command
   prior to the 2006 release that did not support sessions. If
   _<mySessionName>_ is not specified then the buffers are restored but the
   window layout is not restored.


## HISTORY


  The 2006 release removed the `-d` command line option for debugging (not
  used) and added session support by extending the `-c` option with an
  optional _sessionName_ argument.

  In 2021 Detlef Groth joined the maintainer team and adds a Github repository
  at https://github.com/mittelmark/microemacs
 
  The 2023 release adds an alternative screen buffer option -A

## NAME


  memsdev - Microsoft Developer Studio Add-in for MicroEmacs 2009


## SYNOPSIS


  __memsdev.dll__


## DESCRIPTION


  __meMsdev__ is a Microsoft Visual Studio Add-In that allows MicroEmacs 2009 to
  be integrated as the default text editor. It will be used instead of the
  Visual Studio built in editor when you double click on a file or press F4.

  __meMsdev__ may not be supplied built and should be built using Microsoft
  Developer Studio.


## INSTALLATION


  __1)__ Copy mesdev.dll into the MicroEmacs directory i.e.

       c:/Program Files/JASSPA/MicroEmacs


  __2)__ Edit the [me32.ini(8)](me32.ini(8)) file in your Windows directory and identify the
  location of the MicroEmacs executable. The executable name is used to
  spawn MicroEmacs if it is not already running. The entry takes the form:-

       ; Identify the location of the MicroEmacs executable so that the
       ; Developer Studio "Add-In" can locate the executable
       [Location]
       exe=c:\Program Files\JASSPA\MicroEmacs\me32.exe


  Change the _exe_ entry to match the location and name of your executable.

  __3)__ For MS-DEV V5.0 only; from a DOS box, register the DLL using
   __regsvr32.exe(1)__ i.e.

       > cd c:/Program Files/JASSPA/MicroEmacs
       > regsvr32 memsdev.dll


  For MS-DEV V6.0 it is not necessary to perform this registration step.

  __4)__ Start Visual Studio and goto:-

        Tools
            Customize...
                Add-Ins and Macro Files


  __5)__ Click on _Browse_ and point Visual Studio to your __memsdev.dll__ file.

  __6)__ Click the check box to indicate that you want to use the Add-In, and
  close the Customize dialog box.

  __7)__ You should notice the MicroEmacs tool bar showing the MicroEmacs Icon.
  This invokes a dialog that allows you to attach and detach MicroEmacs as
  the default editor.


## USING meMsdev


  Clicking on the MicroEmacs Tool bar shows the meMsdev configuration
  dialog. Check the boxes when MicroEmacs edit session is required as
  default; uncheck the boxes if you wish to revert to the built-in dialog.

  Use Visual Studio as normal, and MicroEmacs should almost always bring
  MicroEmacs to the foreground to edit the document. If a MicroEmacs is
  already running then "meMsdev" will attach to an existing session and will
  load the file. If MicroEmacs is not detected then a new version is spawned
  off and then an attachment is made.


## RUNNING A DEBUG SESSION


  __meMsdev__ does not currently provide any debugging capability (but we are
  working on it !!). To start debugging it is suggested that the Editor is
  decoupled _(MicroEmacs Dialogue -> Uncheck Boxes)_ and work within the
  Developer studio.

  When you have finished debugging and wish to move back to an edit session
  then re-enable MicroEmacs _(MicroEmacs Dialogue -> Check Boxes)_ AND close
  any windows that are open within the MS-Dev environment (
  _Window->Windows...->Select All_ and _Close All Windows_). Then commence
  editing again.

  While MicroEmacs is attached, selecting any of the find file lines,
  compilation error lines etc within the response panes will take MicroEmacs
  to the specified line.


## BUGS


  __meMsdev__ works by hooks exposed by Visual Studio. Most of the functionality
  works from the OpenDocument (look it up in VS 5) hook. So...If a document
  is ALREADY open in Visual Studio, and you double click the file in the
  File Browser...Emacs will NOT come to the foreground. Since the document
  was open in the Visual Studio editor, the OpenDocument event never
  occurred.

## DESCRIPTION


  __NanoEmacs 2009__ is a cut down version of __MicroEmacs 2009__ EMACS text editor,
  based on Danial Lawrences MicroEmacs.

  __NanoEmacs 2009__ provides the basic EMACS editor functions, allowing
  multiple files to be edited at the same time. The screen may be split into
  different windows and screens, and text may be moved freely from one
  window on any screen to the next. The editor typically runs in a console
  mode and is set up for basic system administration work or system bring
  up, macro files are not expected to be present, the system is still
  capable of running a macro file (with limited capability), the default
  start-up file is `ne.emf` and is executed at start-up if present.

  The command line options to __NanoEmacs 2009__ are defined as follows:-

  __@___startFile_
  
  >  Initialize NanoEmacs 2009 using _startFile_[__.emf__]. The default when
     omitted is __ne.emf__. See [start-up(3)](start-up(3)) and [Command Line Filters](Command Line Filters) for more
     information.

  __-a__
  
  > Toggle the auto-save mode, this toggles the [auto(2m)](auto(2m)) mode.

  > >  __Note:__ that NanoEmacs disables auto save mode by default and MicroEmacs
      enables auto save mode by default. The behavior of __-a__ is therefore
      different between the two editors.

  __-b__

  >   Load next file as a binary file (binary editor mode, uses [binary(2m)](binary(2m))
      buffer mode).

  __-B__

  >  Toggle the backup mode, this toggles the [backup(2m)](backup(2m)) mode.

  > >  __Note:__ that NanoEmacs disables backup mode by default and MicroEmacs
      enables backup mode by default. The behavior of __-B__ is therefore
      different between the two editors.

  __-c__

  >  Continuation mode. Load __NanoEmacs 2009__ last edit session, restoring
     the buffers to their previous loaded state and position. Note that
     history mode must be enabled. The __-c__ option is generally used with
     windowing interfaces (X-Windows/Microsoft Windows) as the shortcut
     icon invocation.

  __-h__

  >  Show the help page (does not start the editor).

  __-k__[_key_]

  >  Load next file as an encrypted file (uses [crypt(2m)](crypt(2m)) buffer mode). The
     optional adjoining argument can be used to specify the decrypting key,
     if this argument is not specify the user will be prompted for it on
     start-up.

  __-l___lineNo_

  >  Go to line _lineNo_ in the next given file and optionally to the
     specified column number. The column may be omitted if not required.
     Typically used with utilities such a __more(1)__ where an external editor
     may be invoked from other viewer.

  __-n__

  >  UNIX X-Windows environments only and MicroSoft Windows NT console
     versions. Execute __MicroEmacs 2009__ using termcap rather than X-Windows
     for UNIX; typically used within an __xterm__ shell to fire up MicroEmacs
     2009 for a quick edit. For Microsoft Windows, a console window is
     started as opposed to a GUI window. This option is not present if a
     console version of the application has been built.

  __-R__

  >  Reverse the default video color scheme. The default foreground color
     becomes the background color and vice versa. This only affects the
     built in scheme and not any schemes defined in any start-up file.

  __-r__

  >  Read-only, all buffers will be in view mode

  __-s___string_

  >  Search for string "_string_" in the current buffer. e.g. `ne -sfoo bar`
     starts __MicroEmacs 2009__, loads file `bar` and initiates a search for _foo_.
     The cursor is left at the end of the string if located, otherwise at
     the top of the buffer.

  __-u___username_

  >  Set the current user name [$user-name(5)]($user-name(5)) to _username_ before NanoEmacs
     is initialized.

  __-v___variable=string_

  >  Assign the MicroEmacs 2009 _variable_ with _string_. The assignment is
     performed before the buffers are loaded. Typically used to change the
     start-up characteristics of the startup file(s).

  __-V__

  >  Print the name and version of NanoEmacs. i.e.

        `orac% ne -V`
        `NanoEmacs 05 - Date 2005/02/24 - sunos`

  __-x__

  >  UNIX environments. Disable the capture of signals. __MicroEmacs 2009__ by
     default captures an handles all illicit signal interrupts. The option
     is enabled when debugging the source code allowing exception
     conditions to be trapped within the debugger.

  __-y__

  >  Load next file as a reduced binary file (uses [rbin(2m)](rbin(2m)) buffer mode).


## ENVIRONMENT


  The following environment variables are used by __NanoEmacs 2009__.

  __DISPLAY__

  >  UNIX environments running X-Windows only. The identity of the
     X-Windows server. Typically set to __unix:0.0__, refer to the X-Windows
     documentation for details of this environment variable.

  __MENAME__

  >  [$MENAME(5)]($MENAME(5)) is used to override the identity of the user [$user-name(5)]($user-name(5)).
     The variable may be used to determine which start-up configuration to
     use in the initialization of __MicroEmacs 2009__ (_$user-name_.erf). This is
     ignored if the __-u__ option is specified on the command line.

  >  Non-UNIX platforms usually need to explicitly set the __$MENAME__
     environment variable to identify the aforementioned files. for MS-DOS
     and early versions of Microsoft Windows this is typically performed in
     the `AUTOEXEC.BAT` file.

  __PATH__

  >  The __$PATH__ environment variable is used on most operating systems as a
     search path for executable files. This __$PATH__ environment variable must
     be defined with __MicroEmacs 2009__ on the search path. Under UNIX this is
     set in the `.login`, `.cshrc` or `.profile` file i.e.

            export PATH $PATH:/usr/name/ne

  >  Within MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows environments it is defined in the
     `AUTOEXEC.BAT` file. e.g.

            set PATH=%PATH%;c:\ne

  >  __MicroEmacs 2009__ utilizes information in the __$PATH__ environment variable
     to locate the start-up files, dictionaries etc.

  __TERM__

  >  The terminal identification sting. In UNIX environments the
     environment variable __$TERM__ is set to "`vt...`", in this case it is
     assumed that the machine is a server, and the host cannot support X
     (see command line option __-n__).

  >  In MS-DOS the environment variable is usually set to define the
     graphics adapter mode. __%TERM__ is assigned a string, understood by the
     `me.emf` start-up file, to set the graphics mode. Predefined strings
     include:-

  >  __E80x50__  
  
  > >         Initiates an 80 column by 50 line screen.

  >  __E80x25__  
  
  > >         Initiates an 80 column by 25 line screen.

  >   _userDefined_
  
  > >        A user defined string to set an explicit graphics card mode. The
            operation is dependent upon the support offered by the graphics
            adapter.

  __MEINSTALLPATH__

  >  [$MEINSTALLPATH(5)]($MEINSTALLPATH(5)) is an environment variable that overrides any
     internally defined search path for NanoEmacs system macros and defines
     the root directory(s) of the NanoEmacs system macros. The presence of
     the environment variable affects [$search-path(5)]($search-path(5)).

  __MEUSERPATH__

  >  [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)) is an environment variable that defines the users
     private directory where user configuration files such as
     [$user-name]($user-name(5)).emf, [$user-name]($user-name(5)).erf and personal spelling dictionaries are
     stored. This is an absolute directory path. The environment variable
     sets the NanoEmacs variable [$user-path(5)]($user-path(5)).

  __MEPATH__

  >  [$MEPATH(5)]($MEPATH(5)) is an environment variable that may be used to define the
     absolute search path for NanoEmacs macro files and affects the setting
     of __$search-path__. The path should include the system macros location(s)
     and should include the user directory location [$user-path(5)]($user-path(5)) as the
     first path when the environment variable [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)) is not
     defined. If __$MEUSERPATH__ is defined then this path name appears before
     the __$MEPATH__ variable to define the user directory location. __$MEPATH__ is
     not searching, so ALL directories to be searched must be included in
     the path specification.

  >  [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)) is the preferred method used to defined the user
     directory.


## FILES


  All of the macro files and dictionaries are located in the __NanoEmacs__ home
  directory. The standard file extensions that are utilized are:-

  __.emf__

  >   A __MicroEmacs 2009__ macro file. The following classes of macro file
     exist:

  >  __ne.emf__

  > >         The default startup file.


## MICROSOFT WINDOWS


  Microsoft Windows environments should refer to [me32.ini(8)](me32.ini(8)) for a method of
  setting up the environment variables without editing the `AUTOEXEC.BAT`
  configuration file.

## SYNOPSIS


  __abort-command__ (__C-g__)


## DESCRIPTION


  Aborts the current command, when in trouble, this command will usually
  limit the damage. If you find yourself in a position where you do not want
  to be then this command will usually take you back to a sane state. This
  command rings the bell and stops keyboard macros.

  Avoid re-binding this key where possible as it is used in other places.

  When __abort-command__ is invoked a warning is automatically given alerting
  the user, this may be an audible or a visual warning depending on the
  global state of the [$quiet(5)]($quiet(5)) global variable.

## SYNOPSIS


  __add-color__ "_col-no_" "_red_" "_green_" "_blue_"  
  _n_ __add-color-scheme__ "_schemeNum_" "_fore_" "_back_" 
           "_current-fore_" "_current-back_"  "selected-fore" "selected-back"

            "fm-sel-fore" "fm-sel-back"
            "fm-cur-sel-fore" "fm-cur-sel-back" ]

## DESCRIPTION


  __add-color__ creates a new color and inserts it into MicroEmacs 2009 colors
  table, where _red_, _green_ and _blue_ are the color components and _col-no_ is
  the MicroEmacs 2009 color table number. The color table contains 256
  entries indexed by _col-no_ in the range 0-255.

  On some platforms (DOS and UNIX termcap) the number of colors is
  physically limited by the hardware to less than 256 (typically 16), in
  this case all 256 colors can be defined and for each created color the
  closest system color is used.

  By default, only color 0 (white) and 1 (black) are defined. Once created,
  the colors may be used to create color schemes, this is the sole use of
  colors.

  __add-color__ may be used to modify an existing _col-no_ index by re-assignment,
  the existing color definition is over-written with the new color
  definition. 
  
  __add-color-scheme__ creates a color scheme entry used by
  [hilight(2)](hilight(2)), [screen-poke(2)](screen-poke(2)), [osd(2)](osd(2)) and variables such as
  [$global-scheme(5)]($global-scheme(5)), [$buffer-scheme(5)]($buffer-scheme(5)), [$ml-scheme(5)]($ml-scheme(5)).

  The command takes an index number "_schemeNum_" and eight color values
  (defined by __add-color__) alternating between foreground and background
  colors. The 8 colors represent the 4 color paired states of foreground and
  background that may appear in a text buffer. The paired states correspond
  to current and selected lines (or permutations thereof). If an argument _n_
  is given to the command then _schemeNum_ is set to a duplicate of the _n_th
  scheme, no other arguments are required.

  _schemeNum_ is the identifying index that is used to recognize the scheme.
  By default only two color schemes are defined at initialization, they are
  a monochrome scheme and inverse scheme with indices 0 and 1 using white as
  foreground and black as background, selected text is inverted. When
  defining a color scheme, if an existing _schemeNum_ index is used then that
  scheme is modified.

  The next eight arguments must be given, they specify foreground and
  background color pairs for the four different situations, as follows:-

  Default    
  
  >   Color combination used when none of the following three are
      applicable.

  Current
 
  >   Color combination used when the text is on the same line as the
      cursor. It is also used by the [$mode-line-scheme(5)]($mode-line-scheme(5)) for the current
      window's mode line and for the current selection on an [osd(2)](osd(2)) dialog.

  Selected
 
  >   Color combination used when the text is in the current selected
      region, but is not on the current line. Also used by __osd__ for
      non-current item Hot keys.

  Current-selected
 
  >    Color combination used when the text is on the current line and in the
      current selected region. Also used by __osd__ for the current item's Hot
      key.

  The following 8 arguments set up fonts and are optional, any missing
  arguments are defaulted to 0. Each argument is a bitmask indicating which
  font should be enabled, where each bit is as follows:

       `0x01` Enable bold font.
       `0x02` Enable italic font.
       `0x04` Enable light font.
       `0x08` Enable reverse font.
       `0x10` Enable underlining.

  Normally only the foreground value is used, i.e. the first, third, fifth
  and seventh values. But [screen-poke(2)](screen-poke(2)) can be used to draw reversed color
  scheme in which case the background values are used.


## EXAMPLE


  The color palette is typically created at start-up via the configuration
  file __scheme___X___.emf__. These files are not easily read as they are
  automatically generated via the [scheme-editor(3)](scheme-editor(3)) dialog. A more readable
  form of "`schemed.emf`" would be as follows:-

```{.emf}
        ; Standard colors
        add-color &set .white     0 200 200 200
        add-color &set .black     1 0   0   0
        add-color &set .red       2 200 0   0
        add-color &set .green     3 0   200 0
        add-color &set .yellow    4 200 200 0
        add-color &set .blue      5 0   0   200
        add-color &set .magenta   6 200 0   200
        add-color &set .cyan      7 0   200 200
        ; Light colors
        add-color &set .lwhite    8 255 255 255
        add-color &set .lblack    9 75  75  75
        add-color &set .lred     10 255 0   0
        add-color &set .lgreen   11 0   255 0
        add-color &set .lyellow  12 255 255 0
        add-color &set .lblue    13 0   0   255

        add-color &set .lcyan    15 0   255 255
        ; Selection color
        add-color &set .sel-col  16 91  78  131
        ; Set the required cursor-color
        set-variable $cursor-color .col12
        ; Set up the standard schemes for the text, mode line message line, scroll bar and osd.
        add-color-scheme $global-scheme  .white .black .lwhite .black ...
            ... .white .sel-col .lwhite .sel-col 0 8 1 9 8 0 9 1
        add-color-scheme $ml-scheme  .white .black .lwhite .black ...
            ... .white .sel-col .lwhite .sel-col 0 8 1 9 8 0 9 1
        add-color-scheme $mode-line-scheme  .white .red .lwhite .lred ...
            ... .white .red .lwhite .red 8 0 9 1 0 8 1 9
        add-color-scheme $scroll-bar-scheme .white .lblack .lwhite .lblack ...
            ...  .lblack .white .lblack .lwhite 8 0 9 1 0 8 1 9
            .
            .

```

## NOTES


  Color schemes can be created and altered using the [scheme-editor(3)](scheme-editor(3))
  dialog, the created color scheme can then the used from start-up by using
  the [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) dialog. Therefore direct use of these commands is
  largely redundant.

  The existence of a color or scheme index is checked as each entry is
  submitted, therefore any color or scheme used must have been previously
  been created, otherwise a default value is substituted.

  Changing any existing color definitions causes all references to the color
  from a scheme to adopt the new color.

  Changing any existing color-scheme definitions changes the rendered color
  of any [hilight(2)](hilight(2)) etc., that was using that color-scheme.

  A negative color scheme value (i.e. _-n_) uses the previous '_n_'th entry that
  is defined in the color block. i.e. if _current-fore_ was specified as -2
  then it would inherit the _fore_ field color.

  Not all UNIX terminals support all the above fonts.

  On some telnet packages color is not directly supported and some of the
  termcap display attributes such as bold and italic are represented by a
  color (e.g. italic text is shown in green). Using this translation it is
  possible to achieve reasonable color support on a VT100 terminal - it is a
  little awkward but is worth while if you have to use this type of
  connection frequently.

! 2 add-dictionary
## NAME


  add-dictionary - Declare existence of a spelling dictionary
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __add-dictionary__ "_file_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __add-dictionary__ adds the given dictionary (specified by the given _file_) to
  the dictionary list. Note that the _file_ may omit the __.edf__ extension, this
  is automatically added.

  The command accepts a numeric argument '_n_' which determines the actions to
  be undertaken. When _n_ is omitted then the dictionary is marked for loading
  (on demand) - this is the standard invocation used in the start up files.

  If an argument of __0__ is given the dictionary is created but it is not
  marked for loading, this can be used to create an empty dictionary.

  If an argument of __-1__ is given the contents of the dictionary are dumped
  into the current buffer, used for dictionary maintenance. The two main
  uses of this command are discussed below.


## Dictionary Loading 


  A call to __add-dictionary__ with no numeric argument does not perform an
  immediate load of the dictionary, instead the dictionary is only loaded on
  demand, i.e. when a call to [spell(2)](spell(2)) (usually via [spell-word(3)](spell-word(3)) or
  [spell-buffer(3)](spell-buffer(3))) is made, this ensures that the start up time for
  MicroEmacs does not become too long. When the dictionary is loaded it is
  checked for efficiency, if found to be inefficient it is automatically
  optimized and flagged as changed. On exiting MicroEmacs, the user is
  prompted to save any dictionary that has be altered or optimized.

  The spelling search order is made from the last dictionary added to the
  first, as soon as a word is found in a dictionary the search is halted.
  This implies that if a word has been defined incorrectly in one
  dictionary, but correct in another, the order in which the dictionaries
  are added determines the result.

  The number of dictionaries allowed is unlimited but note that any words
  added are always added to the LAST dictionary. The size of the dictionary
  is restricted to about 16Mb, the size is NOT tested when words are added
  and if this size is exceeded the results are undefined. However, it is
  unlikely that this limit will be reached, the largest dictionary created
  to date is 0.8Mb.

  A new main dictionary may be created as follows:-

  __1)__
    Find a file containing an __ispell(1)__ compatible list of words.

  __2)__
    [execute-file(2)](execute-file(2)) spellutl.emf to define macro [spell-add-word(3)](spell-add-word(3)).

  __3)__
     Start up MicroEmacs 2009 and execute the command __add-dictionary__ giving
     an appropriate new dictionary name.

  __4)__
     Load up the file containing the words and execute the command
    [spell-add-word(3)](spell-add-word(3)) with a very large argument so all the words are
     added.

  __5)__
     Save the dictionary by either executing the command [save-dictionary(2)](save-dictionary(2))
     or exiting.


## Dictionary Dump 


  A call to __add-dictionary__ with a numeric argument _n_ of -1 causes the
  contents of the given dictionary to be dumped into the current buffer
  (make sure you are in an empty buffer or __*scratch*__) where:

       `xxxx` - Good word `xxxx` with no spell rules allowed
       `xxxx/abc` - Good word `xxxx` with spell rules `abc` allowed
       `xxxx>yyyy` - Erroneous word with an auto-replace to `yyyy`

  The dump of the dictionary may be edited, allowing erroneous entries to be
  removed. The macro file `spellutl.emf` contains macros [edit-dictionary(3)](edit-dictionary(3))
  and [restore-dictionary(3)](restore-dictionary(3)) which enable the user to edit a dictionary.


## NOTES


  MicroEmacs 2009 is supplied with a dictionaries for American and British
  English, it is strongly suggested that these dictionaries are __NOT__ modified
  in anyway. Ensure that the dictionary is protected by loading the base
  dictionaries first, followed by a personal dictionary. New words added
  during spelling will then be added to the personal dictionary rather than
  the main dictionary.


## EXAMPLE


  The MicroEmacs 2009 start-up file __me.emf__ executes __language.emf__ which in
  turn executes the user language setup file, for example __american.emf__,
  which adds the main language dictionaries and rules. __language.emf__ then
  adds the user's dictionary, this process can be simplified to:-

```{.emf}
        ; add the main American dictionary
        add-dictionary "lsdmenus"

        ; reset the spell rules
        0 add-spell-rule
        ; Now add the American spell rules
        -2 add-spell-rule "A" "" "" "re" ; As in enter > reenter
        -2 add-spell-rule "I" "" "" "in" ; As in disposed > indisposed
            .
            .
        ; Now add the user dictionary
        add-dictionary $MENAME

```

! 2 add-file-hook
## NAME


  add-file-hook - Declare file name context dependent configuration
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __add-file-hook__ "_extensions_" "_fhook-name_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __add-file-hook__ defines a macro binding between a file name or file type and
  a set of macros. This binding enables file type dependent screen
  highlighting and key bindings to be performed. For a higher level
  introduction refer to [File Hooks](fileHooks(2)).

  __add-file-hook__ operates in two different modes to establish the type of file:-

  - Content recognition, by examination of the contents of the file.
  - File extension recognition.

  Content recognition has the highest priority and is used in preference to
  the file extension.

  __add-file-hook__ is called multiple times to add new recognition rules. The
  rules are interrogated in last-in-first-out (LIFO) order, hence the
  extension added last has a greater precedence than those added first. This
  ordering allows default rules to be over-ridden.


## Initialization 


  __add-file-hook__ must be initialized prior to the first call, using an
  invocation of the form:-

```{.emf}
        0 add-file-hook

```

  with a numeric argument _n_ of 0, and no arguments. This invocation resets
  the file hooks by deleting all of the installed hooks.


## File Extension Recognition 


  __add-file-hook__ with no numerical argument _n_ allows the extension of a file
  (or the base file name if there is no extension) to be used to determine
  which user defined setup macro is to be executed. The _extensions_ argument
  is a space separated list of _file endings_ (as opposed to true extensions)
  and is usually specified with the extension separator. For example, the
  extension "`.doc`" may indicate that the file is a document and therefore
  the [indent](indent(2m)), [wrap](wrap(2m)) and [justify](justify(2m)) buffer modes are required. This may be
  performed automatically by defining a macro which adds these modes and
  adding a file hook to automatically execute this macro whenever a file
  "`*.doc`" is loaded.

  The command arguments are defined as follows:-

  _extensions_
  
  >  A space separated list of file extensions, which are to be checked,
     this list includes the extension separator (typically dot ('`.`'). It
     should be noted that the extension search is actually a comparison of
     the tail of the string, as such files such as _makefile_, which do not
     have an extension, are specified literally.

  _fhook-name_
  
  >  The name of the file hook to execute. This is the name of the macro to
     execute that initializes the buffer.

  As an example:-

```{.emf}
        define-macro fhook-doc
            1 buffer-mode "indent"
            1 buffer-mode "wrap"
            1 buffer-mode "justify"
        !emacro

        add-file-hook ".doc" "fhook-doc"

```
  It is quite possible that the same macro should be executed for a text
  file, i.e. "`*.txt`" this is achieved by a single __add-file-hook__ as the space
  (' ') character is used as an extension separator, e.g.

```{.emf}
        add-file-hook ".doc .txt" "fhook-doc"

```
  There are three special file hooks, which are __fhook-binary__, __fhook-rbin__ and
  __fhook-default__, these are not predefined, but if the user defines them then
  they are executed whenever a file is loaded in [binary](binary(2m)) or [reduced binary](rbin(2m))
  mode (see [buffer-mode(2)](buffer-mode(2))) or the extension does not match any of those
  defined.

  Considering the `fhook-XXX` prefix, the initial '__f__' character must be
  present as this is changed to a '__b__' and an '__e__' when looking for the enter
  (begin) buffer and exit buffer hooks. These hooks are executed whenever
  the user swaps to or from a buffer (including creating and deleting). So
  for the given example, if the fill ignore characters are to be changed
  then this operation this is performed by defining the `bhook-XXX` and
  `ehook-XXX` macros, e.g.:-

```{.emf}
        ; Begin hook - entering the buffer - save the current fill-ignore characters
        define-macro bhook-java
            !if &exi .fhook-java.fill-ignore
                set-variable .fhook-java.ofill-ignore $fill-ignore
                set-variable $fill-ignore .fhook-java.fill-ignore
            !endif
        !emacro

        ; End hook - leaving the buffer - restore the fill-ignore characters
        define-macro ehook-java
            !if &exi .fhook-java.fill-ignore
                set-variable $fill-ignore .fhook-java.ofill-ignore
            !endif
        !emacro

        ; Fix up the $fill-mode so that we wrap java doc parameters. Do this by
        ; removing the "@" from the $fill-ignore variable.
        !if &sin "@" $fill-ignore
            set-variable .fhook-java.fill-ignore $fill-ignore
            set-variable .fhook-java.fill-ignore &rep .fhook-java.fill-ignore "@" ""
        !endif

```

  File hooks are often used to setup the desired _buffer modes_, _hilighting_,
  _local key bindings_, _abbreviation file_, etc.

  Buffer hooks are usually used to set and restore conflicting global
  variables.


## File Content Recognition 

  __add-file-hook__ with a non-zero numerical argument _n_ defines a macro binding
  between the content in a file and a set of macros. This binding enables
  file type dependent screen hi-lighting and key binding to be performed.
  For a full description of file hooks refer to [File Hooks](fileHooks(2)), for file
  extension dependent hooking refer to [add-file-hook(2)](add-file-hook(2)).

  The content defined file hooks interrogate the contents of a file on
  loading and search for a _magic_ string identifier embedded in the text
  which uniquely identifies the file type.

  The recognition process performs a search of the first _n_ (numerical
  argument) non-blank lines of the file, searching for the regular
  expression specified by the _extensions_ argument. The sign of the numerical
  argument _n_ is interpreted as follows:-

  - __-ve__ - Case insensitive search
  - __+ve__ - Case sensitive search

  The command arguments are defined as follows:-

  _extensions_ 

  > A regular expression string defining the text to be searched for.

  _fhook-name_ 

  >  The name of the file hook to execute. This is the name of the macro to
     execute that will initialize the buffer.

  The search commences from the first non-blank line in the file, if the
  regular expression, defined by _extensions_ is located then the file hook
  _fhook-name_ is invoked. This is typically used to identify files which do
  not have file extensions i.e. UNIX shell script files. To identify a shell
  script file which commences with:-

        #!/bin/sh


  The following file hook is used:-

  __1 add-file-hook__ "__#!/.*sh__" "__fhook-shell__"

  Note that "`.*sh`" also matches `/bin/csh`, `/usr/local/bin/zsh` etc, so care
  should be taken to ensure that the regular expression string is
  sufficiently well specified to recognize the file type.

  The second class of embedded text are explicit identifiers embedded into
  the text. The embedded strings take the form:

     `-*-` _mode_ `-*`  
     `-*-` __Mode:__ _mode_; ... `-*-`  
     `-!-` _mode_ `-!-`  

  The `-*-` notation belongs to GNU Emacs, but MicroEmacs 2009 recognizes the
  construct and extracts the string correctly. The `-!-` notation is
  MicroEmacs 2009 specific and is provided so as not to cause conflict with
  GNU Emacs. MicroEmacs 2009 searches for either construct on the first
  non-blank line of the file.

  The explicit strings are defined with a negative numerical argument _n_,
  which identifies them as __explicit__ rather than __magic__ text strings. The
  _string_ should be defined in lower case and matches a case insensitive
  string take from the file. e.g. to define a file hook for a make file:

        #_____________________________-!-Makefile-!-________________________________
        #
        # Make file for MicroEmacs using the Microsoft MSCV 2.0/4.0 development kit.
        #

        # Last Edited : <150297.1942>
        # File        : makefile.w32
        ....


  might be defined as:

  -1 __add-file-hook__ "-!-[ \t]*makefile.*-!-" fhook-make


## NOTES


## Automatic Macro File Loading 


  __add-file-hook__ performs an automatic load of a macro file if the __fhook__
  macro is not present in memory. The file name of the command file
  containing the macro is automatically derived from the _name_ component of
  the __fhook__ macro name. The __fhook-__ part of the name is stripped off and
  prepended with __hk__ and suffixed with __.emf__. Hence, macro __fhook-doc__ would be
  searched for in file `hkdoc.emf` within the MicroEmacs 2009 directory. The
  command file is automatically loaded and executed.

  In cases where the fhook macro is not located in an equivalent hook file,
  the file location of the macro may be explicitly defined for auto loading
  via a [define-macro-file(2)](define-macro-file(2)) invocation.

  As an example, consider the C-mode file hook, used to load `.c` files. The
  loading of a C header file (`.h`) utilizes the same highlighting modes, but
  it's startup sequence is slightly different when handling new files. In
  this case the __fhook-cmode__ for `.c` and __fhook-hmode__ for `.h` files are located
  in the same hook file namely `hkcmode.emf`.

```{.emf}
        define-macro-file hkcmode fhook-hmode

        add-file-hook ".c .cc .cpp .def .l .y .i .ac"   "fhook-cmode"
        add-file-hook ".h .hpp"                         "fhook-hmode"

```

  In this case the [define-macro-file](define-macro-file(2)) has been used to inform MicroEmacs 2009
  of the location of the __fhook-hmode__ macro thereby overriding the automatic
  load of a file called __hkhmode.emf__. The __fhook-cmode__ macro requires no such
  definition as it is located in a hook file that matches the mode name,
  `hkcmode.emf`.


## Extending a standard hook definition 


  The standard file hook files __hkXXX.emf__ should not be modified. The
  standard file hooks may be extended with local definitions by defining a
  file __myXXX.emf__, which is an extension to the hook file __hkXXX.emf__. This is
  automatically executed after __hkXXX.emf__. Refer to sections
  [languageTemplates(2)](Language Templates) and [File Hooks](fileHooks(2)) for details.


## File Extensions 


  The file extensions are specified as a space separated list of file name
  endings. Back-up file endings such as tilde (`~`) are not classed as correct
  file endings and are skipped by the file hook search, hence a file ending
  "`.c~`" invokes the same hook function as a "`.c`" file. It is therefore not
  necessary to add the backup and auto-save endings to the file hook
  definition.

  The extension separator, usually dot (`.`), is typically added to the
  _extensions_ list, they may be omitted with effect where a file always ends
  in the same set of characters. A notable example is "`makefile`" which
  includes no extension, as such, MicroEmacs 2009 applies the same hook
  function to a file called `Imakefile` as the endings are the same.


## Binary Files 


  It is sometimes useful to associate file types as binary files, so that
  they are immediately loaded in binary. In this case, both file extension
  and content recognition methods (i.e. of a magic string) are applicable.
  In both cases the file is bound to the well known hook `fhook-binary` which
  automatically loads the file in a binary mode.

  Note, that for the content recognition process for a binary hook, the load
  time is doubled as the file is initially loaded in the default text mode,
  the binary hook function forces a second load operation in binary.


## SUMMARY


  __add-file-hook__ is summarized as follows:-

  - Binds one or more extensions to a macro called fhook-_xxxx_.
  - Extensions are typically specified with the dot (`.`) separator.
  - Multiple extensions are specified as a space separated list.
  - Binds a regular expression search string to a macro called
        fhook-xxxx.
  - The absolute value of the numerical argument determines the number
        of lines in the file over which the regular expression search is
        made.
  - The sign of the numerical argument determines if the regular
        expression search is case (in)sensitive.
  - When one of the files with a known file extension, or recognized
        content, is loaded macro fhook-xxxx is executed.
  - __fhook-xxxx__, if undefined, is automatically searched for in file
        hkxxxx.emf.
  - When the buffer containing the known file is entered (i.e. gains
        focus), then entry macro bhook-xxxx is executed.
  - When the buffer containing the known file is exited (i.e. looses
        focus), then the exit macro ehook-xxxx is executed.


## EXAMPLE

## OBSCURE INFORMATION


  This section includes some low-level information which is so obscure it is
  not relevant to the typical user.


## Resolving Loading Order Problems 


  There is a potential loading order problem involving auto-loading of file
  libraries and the setting up of __bhook__ and __ehook__. E.g. if the main fhook
  function has been defined as a [define-macro-file(2)](define-macro-file(2)), but the bhook or
  ehooks have not the when a buffer is created as only the fhook is define,
  only the fhook is set, the rest remain disabled even though the execution
  of the macro file will define these extra hooks.

  To solve this problem simply define the bhook/ehooks as well. Note that
  automatically loaded hooks do not suffer from this problem as the macro
  file is executed before the hooks are assigned, thereby ensuring the all
  the hooks are defined.

## NAME


|osd-bind-key
  osd-bind-key - Create key binding for OSD dialog
|osd-unbind-key
  osd-unbind-key - Remove key binding from OSD dialog
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __osd-bind-key__ _n_ "_command_" "_key_"
  __osd-unbind-key__ _n_ "_key_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __osd-bind-key__ creates a local key binding for a given [osd dialog](osd(2)), binding
  the command _command_ to the keyboard input _key_. Only the current root
  dialog's local bindings are used, local bindings of included dialogs or
  other root dialogs currently displayed are ignored.

  Osd local bindings take priority over default osd bindings, local bindings
  created using [ml-bind-key(2)](ml-bind-key(2)) are also used, but any current buffer local
  bindings created using [buffer-bind-key(2)](buffer-bind-key(2)) are ignored.


## NOTES


  The prefix commands cannot be rebound with this command.

  Key response time linearly increases with each osd binding added.

  As only the root dialog's bindings are used, creating note-book page
  specific bindings can be awkward. Typically all required keys are bound to
  the same command which, depending on the page that is currently being
  displayed, checks if the key pressed is bound on the current page and if
  so calls the required command. See [organizer(3)](organizer(3)), defined in `organize.emf`
  for an example of this operation.

## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __global-mode__ "_mode_" (__esc m__)  
  __add-global-mode__ "_mode_"  
  __delete-global-mode__ "_mode_"  


## DESCRIPTION


  __global-mode__ changes the state of one of the hereditary global modes. A
  buffer's modes are initialized to the global modes when first created.
  This command is very useful in changing some of the default behavior such
  as case sensitive searching (see the example below). See [Operating Modes](Operating Modes)
  for a full list and description of modes. Also see [buffer-mode(2)](buffer-mode(2)) for a
  full description of the use of the argument _n_.

  The [about(2)](about(2)) command gives a list of the current global and buffer modes.

  __add-global-mode__ and __delete-global-mode__ are macros defined in meme3_8.emf
  which use global-mode to add or remove a global mode. They are defined for
  backward compatibility with MicroEMACS v3.8 and for ease of use; they are
  simple macros, add-global-mode is defined as follows:

```{.emf}
        define-macro add-global-mode
            ; Has the require mode been given as an argument, if so add it
            !force 1 global-mode @1
            !if &not $status
                ; No - use 1 global-mode to add a mode
                !nma 1 global-mode
            !endif
        !emacro

```

## EXAMPLE


  The following example globally disables [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) and [magic(2m)](magic(2m)) modes, if
  these lines are copied to the user setup file then are searches will be
  simple and case insensitive by default:

```{.emf}
        -1 global-mode "exact"
        -1 global-mode "magic"

```

## NOTES


  Globally adding [binary(2m)](binary(2m)), [crypt(2m)](crypt(2m)) and [rbin(2m)](rbin(2m)) modes is strongly
  discouraged as any file loaded would be assigned these modes. Instead use
  the numeric argument of command [find-file(2)](find-file(2)) or commands [find-bfile(3)](find-bfile(3)) and
  [find-cfile(3)](find-cfile(3)).

  [auto(2m)](auto(2m)), [autosv(2m)](autosv(2m)), [backup(2m)](backup(2m)), [exact(2m)](exact(2m)), [magic(2m)](magic(2m)), [quiet(5)]($quiet(5)), [tab(2m)](tab(2m))
  and [undo(2m)](undo(2m)) modes are present on all platforms by default. On Windows and
  DOS platforms [cr(2m)](cr(2m)) and [lf(2m)](lf(2m)) is also present and on DOS [ctrlz(2m)](ctrlz(2m)) is
  also present.

          -27      27      155     wrap


  Note that when omitted the default argument is 0, i.e. prompt for and
  toggle a mode.

  __named-buffer-mode__ changes the state of a given buffer mode for a given
  buffer which may not be the current buffer.

  __add-mode__ and __delete-mode__ are macros which use buffer-mode to add and
  remove a buffer mode. 
  
  __unmark-buffer__ is also a macro which removes the edit
  flag from the current buffer. They are defined for backward compatibility
  with MicroEMACS v3.8 and can be found in meme3_8.emf; add-mode is defined
  as follows:

```{.emf}
        define-macro add-mode
            ; Has the require mode been given as an argument, if so add it
            !force 1 buffer-mode @1
            !if &not $status
                ; No - use 1 buffer-mode to add a mode
                !nma 1 buffer-mode
            !endif
        !emacro

```

## NOTES


  When a buffer is created it inherits the current global mode state.

## NAME


  add-next-line - Define the searching behavior of command output
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __add-next-line__ "_buffer-name_" [ "_string_" ]


## DESCRIPTION


  __add-next-line__ is used to set up the _next-line_ functionality which is used
  by the [get-next-line(2)](get-next-line(2)) command. The _next-line_ feature is aimed at giving
  the user easy access to file locations which are stored in another buffer.
  This buffer may typically be the output from the __grep(1)__ command or a
  compiler (e.g. __cc(1)__) and needs to contain the file name and line number
  of the required location.

  As long as the format of the buffer is consistent and there is a maximum
  of one location per line, the _next-line_ feature can be successfully
  configured.

  The first argument, "_buffer-name_", gives the name the aforementioned
  buffer, this is "__*grep*__" for the [grep(3)](grep(3)) command etc. There is no limit on
  the number of next-line formats, nor on the number of __add-next-line__
  strings which are given. While there is no real need to initialize each
  new type, it is advised that the first __add-next-line__ is called with a
  numerical argument of zero, e.g.:

```{.emf}
        0 add-next-line "*grep*"
        add-next-line "*grep*" "....."

```
  
  This tells MicroEmacs to reinitialize the type by freeing off any strings
  currently stored, note that the "_string_" argument is not used in this
  case. Resetting the next-line type safe guards against duplicate strings
  being added to it, a common problem if MicroEmacs is reinitialized.

  Following is a typical output from grep:

       foo.c: 45:      printf("hello world\n") ;
       foo.c: 46:      printf("hello again\n") ;


  If we replace the file name with "`%f`" and the line number with "`%l`", this
  becomes:

       %f: %l:      printf("hello world\n") ;


  [get-next-line](get-next-line(2)) works on a left to right basis, as soon as it has enough
  information from the line it does not need to continue. Therefore the
  previous example can be reduced to just "`%f: %l:`". This is the string
  argument that should be given for the above example, i.e.:

```{.emf}
        add-next-line "*grep*" "%f: %l:"

```

  [get-next-line](get-next-line(2)) takes the given string and replaces the "%f" with
  [$file-template(5)]($file-template(5)) and the "%l" with the [$line-template(5)]($line-template(5)) and then uses
  the resultant string as a regular expression search string to find the
  next location. Crudely these could be set to "`foo.c`" and "`45`" respectively
  to find the first example, but this would fail to find any other. As a
  result the templates are usually magic search strings which will match any
  file and line number.

  Similarly, following is an example output of the __gcc(1)__ compiler:

       basic.c:522: warning: `jj' might be used uninitialized in this command
       display.c:833: warning: implicit declaration of function `ScreenPutChar'


  In this case the __add-next-line__ given needs to be:

```{.emf}
        add-next-line "*compile*" "%f:%l:"

```

  If a negative numerical argument is given to __add-next-line__ the given
  'next-line' is ignored, this can be useful when some warnings are to be
  ignored. For example a common warning from gcc is given when a variable
  might be used uninitialized, given as follows:

       bind.c:578: warning: `ssc' might be used uninitialized in this function


  These warnings can be ignored using the following:

```{.emf}
        -1 add-next-line "*compile*" ...
            ... "%f:%l: warning: `.*' might be used uninitialized in this function"

```

  Some versions of __grep(1)__ give the file name first and then the lines on
  the following lines. This is not a major problem as __get-next-line__
  remembers the last file name. The only problem occurs when skipping some
  parts of the list at which point the last file name parsed may not be the
  current file. Following is an example output of such a __grep__ and the setup
  required:

       File foo.c:
       Line 45:      printf("hello world\n") ;
       Line 46:      printf("hello again\n") ;


  The configuration to locate the lines is defined as:

```{.emf}
        0 add-next-line "*grep*"
        add-next-line "*grep*" "File %f:"
        add-next-line "*grep*" "Line %l:"

```

## NOTES


  The reinitialize command format of this command changed in January 2001,
  the format changed from:

```{.emf}
        add-next-line "*grep*" ""

```

! 2 save-registry
## NAME


  save-registry - Write a registry definition file
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __save-registry__ ["_root_" "_file_"]


## DESCRIPTION


  __save-registry__ saves a registry tree, defined by _root_, to a registry file
  _file_ in the [erf(8)](erf(8)) format. By default the user is prompted for the
  registry _root_ to save, which must already exist. If the _file_ given is the
  empty string `""`, the registry node _root_ must be a root node with an
  associated file name stored, this file name is used.

  The argument _n_ may be used to control the effect of the command, _n_ is a
  bit based flag defined as follows:-

  __0x01__
 
  >  Enables prompting before saving, only used when saving all registries.

  __0x02__

  >  Save all changed registries except the history node which should be
     saved using the command [save-session(3)](save-session(3)).


## NOTES


  This command is called to save all registry changes whenever MicroEmacs is
  exited.

## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __command-apropos__ "_string_" (__C-h a__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __command-apropos__ compiles a list of all commands with _string_ in their name,
  also giving their current key bindings. Only commands that are not hidden
  are displayed, if a numeric argument of 0 is supplied then all commands
  are displayed, irrespective of their visibility.


## EXAMPLE


  To find all of the commands with "`command`" in their name space then issue
  the command "`C-h a command`" which generates a list of commands such as:-

       abort-command ................. "C-g"
                                          "esc C-g"

! 2 end-kbd-macro
## NAME


|start-kbd-macro
  start-kbd-macro - Start/stop recording keyboard macro
|end-kbd-macro
  end-kbd-macro - Stop recording keyboard macro
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __start-kbd-macro__ (__C-x (__)  
  __end-kbd-macro__ (__C-x )__)


## DESCRIPTION


  A keyboard macro is a short hand way to repeat a series of characters. In
  effect, a _recording_ is made of the sequence of keys that you hit while
  defining a keyboard macro. The recording is started with __start-kbd-macro__
  and ended with __end-kbd-macro__. The recording is then repeated whenever you
  execute the keyboard macro using [execute-kbd-macro(2)](execute-kbd-macro(2)).

  Since it is key-strokes that are being saved, you can freely intermix
  commands and text to be inserted into the buffer.

  You can save a keyboard macro for later using the [name-kbd-macro(2)](name-kbd-macro(2))
  command, which saves the keyboard macro as a named macro. Otherwise if you
  start another keyboard macro recording session, the previously defined
  macro is lost. So make sure that you are done with the current keyboard
  macro before defining another one. If you have a series of commands that
  you would like to _record_ for later use, [insert-macro(2)](insert-macro(2)) can be used to
  insert the macro into a text file and can be reloaded using the
  [execute-file(2)](execute-file(2)) or [execute-buffer(2)](execute-buffer(2)) commands.
  Using the command [save-kbd-macro(3)](save-kbd-macro(3)) the named recorded macro can
  saved to the users emf file.
  
  Recording commences with __start-kbd-macro__ (`C-x (`) and terminates when an
  __end-kbd-macro__ (`C-x )` is encountered.


## NOTES


  Once __start-kbd-macro__ has been executed, the mouse is disabled until
  __end-kbd-macro__ is executed. This is because the mouse events cannot be
  successfully recorded in macros. The main menu can still be used, but only
  via the keyboard bindings and hot-keys (note that the layout of the menu
  may change).

## NAME


|global-bind-key
  global-bind-key - Bind a key to a named command or macro
|global-unbind-key
  global-unbind-key - "Unbind a key from a named command or macro"
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __global-bind-key__ "_command_" "_key_" (__esc k__)  
  _n_ __global-unbind-key__ "_key_" (__esc C-k__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __global-bind-key__ takes one of the named commands and binds it to a key.
  Thereafter, whenever that key is struck, the bound command is executed. If
  an argument _n_ is given then the bound command is executed _n_ times when the
  key is struck. (i.e. the command is passed the numeric argument '_n_').

  __global-unbind-key__ unbinds (detaches) a user entered _key_ sequence (i.e. C-x
  C-f) from any command to which it may be bound. This does not work with
  [buffer](buffer-bind-key(2)) or [message line](ml-bind-key(2)) key bindings, see [buffer-unbind-key(2)](buffer-unbind-key(2)) and
  [ml-unbind-key(2)](ml-unbind-key(2)). If an argument of 0 is given to global-unbind-key, only
  a single key is obtained for the user, if the character is currently bound
  to the [prefix](prefix(2)) command, the prefix binding and any sub-bindings are
  removed. __global-bind-key__ calls __global-unbind-key__ first if the key to be
  bound is already bound to something else.

  If a negative argument is given to __global-unbind-key__ then all bindings are
  removed, __caution__ - removing all bindings interactively will render the
  current MicroEmacs session unusable. This can only be used within macro
  development where new bindings are created immediately afterwards.

  The __global-bind-key__ command, currently bound to `esc k`, prompts the user
  for the named command and the key to which it is to be bound. This help
  file gives a complete list of all built in commands, and some useful
  macros, a complete list of all commands and macros can be obtained by
  using the command completion (type `esc x` `tab` `tab`, see [ml-bind-key(2)](ml-bind-key(2))) or
  using the command [describe-bindings(2)](describe-bindings(2)).

  The mouse buttons are considered to be _keys_, there is a _key_ for each
  button press and release event, use [describe-key(2)](describe-key(2)) to get the binding key
  string.

  The non-ASCII standard keys such as the cursor keys have 'standard' key
  names to make cross platform binding support easy. Some systems such as
  _termcap_ do not have fixed key-bindings, for these key the users must use
  the command [translate-key(2)](translate-key(2)) to convert the system key binding to the
  standard key binding.

  Permanent changes are done indirectly through the `me.emf` file. This is a
  file that MicroEmacs 2009 reads and executes (see [execute-file(2)](execute-file(2))) during
  startup and hence results in the appearance of a permanent change in the
  key bindings. The syntax of commands in the `me.emf` file is described under
  the [execute-file](execute-file(2)) command. Of principal concern here are the two commands
  __global-bind-key__ and __global-unbind-key__. The primary difference between the
  way parameters are passed to these commands in the `me.emf` file is that the
  keys are not typed in directly (as in the _control-I_ key when you want `C-i`)
  but by symbolic names. Every key has a unique name which can be easily
  obtained with the current binding by using the command [describe-key(2)](describe-key(2)).

  See help on [Key Names](keyNames(2)) for a description of the symbolic naming system and
  a complete list of valid key names. Also see [Bindings](Bindings(2)) for a complete list
  of default key bindings.


## EXAMPLE


  __Alt P__

```{.emf}
        global-bind-key "func" "A-p"

```

  __Control F2__

```{.emf}
        global-bind-key "func" "C-f3"

```

  __Shift Alt Left Cursor__

```{.emf}
        global-bind-key "func" "A-S-left"

```
  __Control Alt Delete__

```{.emf}
        global-bind-key "func" "C-A-delete"

```

  Note that binding __Control-Alt-Delete__ is not recommended for MS-DOS
  systems for obvious reasons.


## NOTES


  Some ASCII keys, such as `<CR>` (C-m), `<tab>` (C-i), `<BACKSPACE>` (C-h) have
  non-ASCII key bindings, namely "__return__", "__tab__", "__backspace__" etc. this is
  to allow separate key-bindings for the real "__C-m__" etc.

  Be very careful in binding and unbinding keys since you could get into
  some very peculiar situations such as being unable to abort out of a
  command (if you unbind CTRL-G or bind it to something else) or recover
  from the bad binding/unbinding if you unbind [execute-named-command(2)](execute-named-command(2)) or
  the __global-unbind-key__ command. As long as you leave yourself the
  opportunity to do both of the last two commands, you can recover from
  disastrous bindings/unbindings.

## NAME

$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __change-frame-depth__ [ "_depth_" ]  
  _n_ __change-frame-width__ [ "_width_" ]


## DESCRIPTION


  __change-frame-depth__ changes the depth of the current frame, if the numeric
  argument _n_ is given then the frame depth is changed by _n_ lines. If _n_ is
  not specified the user is prompted for the new _depth_ and the frame depth
  will be changed to this value. It is assumed that the screen can draw the
  requested _n_ lines and MicroEmacs draws the lines at the users peril.

  A change in depth causes all of the internal windows currently displayed
  in the frame to be re-sized, the vertical position of the windows are
  modified to match the new screen dimension, the horizontal position of the
  windows remains unaltered. If the window is down-sized and the currently
  displayed windows are not able to fit into the new screen space then all
  windows are deleted with the exception of the current window.

  __change-frame-width__ changes the width of the current frame, if the numeric
  argument _n_ is given then the frame width is changed by _n_ characters. If _n_
  is not specified the user is prompted for the new _width_ and the frame
  width will be changed to this value. It is assumed that the screen can
  draw the requested _n_ columns and MicroEmacs draws them at the users peril.
  The windows are reorganized as __change-frame-depth__ working horizontally
  rather than vertically.


## NOTES


  Within windowing environments such as __X-Windows__ and __Microsoft Windows__
  these commands cause the canvas window to be re-sized to accommodate the
  change in screen size.

  In MS-DOS and UNIX Termcap environments the physical size of the screen is
  determined by the characteristics of the display adapter.
  __change-frame-depth__ may be used to correct anomalies (usually on portables)
  in the displayable screen area and the graphics mode. e.g. In DOS the
  graphics mode utilizes 50 lines, and only 47 lines are viewable. In this
  case change the screen depth to 47 and MicroEmacs will not utilize the
  remaining lines which are not viewable.

! 2 search-buffer
## NAME


  search-buffer - Search the current buffer for a string
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __search-buffer__ "_flags_" "_string_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __search-buffer__ searches for a _string_ from the current cursor position, in a
  forwards or backwards direction, to the end or start of the buffer,
  respectively. The search direction and mode is specified by the by _flags_
  argument.

  The __search-buffer__ command is designed to be used from the macro language
  rather than the command line as the search may be defined independently of
  the buffer setting of [magic(2m)](magic(2m)) mode, which allows regular expression
  pattern matching, or [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) mode, which makes the search case
  sensitive. The _flags_ argument is used to explicitly set the [magic(2m)](magic(2m)) and
  [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) search modes.

  The _flags_ argument is defined as a character string which defines the
  search behavior:

  `b` - backward search
  
   > Specifies the direction of the search as backwards, when omitted then
     a forward search is performed.

  `e` - enable exact search
  
  >  A [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) mode search is performed, the characters are matched case
     sensitively.

  `E` - disable exact search

   > A [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) mode search is not performed, the characters are matched
     case insensitively.

  `m` - enable magic
 
  >  A [magic(2m)](magic(2m)) mode search is performed, the search _string_ is interpreted
     as a regular expression.

  `M` - disable magic

  >  A [magic(2m)](magic(2m)) mode search is not performed, the search string is
     searched for literally.

  When the _flags_ are not specified then the default behavior is to search in
  a forwards direction inheriting the [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) and [magic(2m)](magic(2m)) modes of the
  buffer. Within macros it is suggested that the search modes are explicitly
  specified unless the buffer modes are to be inherited.

  The numeric argument _n_ is interpreted in the same way as a
  [search-forward(2)](search-forward(2)) command:-

  __n > 0__
  
  >  The _n_th occurrence of the _string_ is located.

  __n < 0__
  
  >  The first occurrence of the _string_ is located in the next _n_ lines.


## DIAGNOSTICS


  The command returns a status of `FALSE` if the _string_ could not be located
  (or _n_th _string_ where _n_ occurrences are requested). If the _string_ is found
  within the given search criteria the return status is `TRUE`.


## EXAMPLE


  The following examples show the use of the __search-buffer__ command. The
  __search-buffer__ is usually used with the [!force(4)](!force(4)) directive which traps any
  `FALSE` return status and may be subsequently tested using the [!if(4)](!if(4))
  directive on the status [$status(5)]($status(5)) variable. If the __!force__ directive is
  omitted then the macro will abort with a failure status if the search
  fails (sometimes this behavior may be required).

  Case sensitive search forward for the word "`foo`", this is not a magic
  regular expression.

```{.emf}
        !force search-buffer "eM" "foo"
        !if $status
            ; found string
        !else
            ; not found
        !endif

```

  Case sensitive search bacward for the word "`foo`", this is not a magic
  regular expression.

```{.emf}
        search-buffer "beM" "foo"

```

  Regular expression search forward for ``<`' or ``>`'.

```{.emf}
        search-buffer "m" "[<>]"

```

  Regular expression search catching the regular expression. A[a-z]*. The
  macro variable __@s1__ returns the regular expression string that has been
  found.

```{.emf}
        !force search-buffer "em" "\\(A[a-z]*\\)"

## NOTES


  __Search-buffer__ was added in November 2004 to simplify macro writing and to
  speed up macro execution. It replaces the macro commands __regex-forward(3)__
  and __regex-backward(3)__. The command simplifies macro development by
  allowing the [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) and [magic(2m)](magic(2m)) modes to be specified on the command
  line, this ensures that the buffer mode does not need to be saved, set and
  then restored in order to modify the behaviour of a search operation.

## NAME


|compare-windows
  compare-windows - Compare buffer windows, ignore whitespace.
|compare-windows-exact
  compare-windows-exact - Compare buffer windows, with whitespace.
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __compare-windows__  
  __compare-windows-exact__


## DESCRIPTION


  __compare-windows__ compares the textural content of ALL the current windows
  from their current cursor position. These commands are generally used to
  locate the next difference in the windows displayed. Returns `TRUE` if the
  buffers of the windows do not differ from the current position to the end
  of the file (inclusive), else returns `FALSE` setting the cursor of each
  buffer to the first point of difference.

  The default mode of operation ignores white-space, a numeric argument _n_ of
  zero (0) then an exact white-space match is performed.

  __compare-windows-exact__ is a macro short cut for _0 compare-windows_, forcing
  a white space comparison.

! 2 set-scroll-with-mouse
## NAME


  set-scroll-with-mouse - Scroll the window with the mouse
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __set-scroll-with-mouse__


## DESCRIPTION


  The __set-scroll-with-mouse__ command controls the scrolling of a window by
  the mouse. This is a two stage process, the first stage locks the cursor
  to the mouse, the second stage scrolls the screen.

  The first stage (locking) is performed when the mouse is located on the
  scroll-box (typically when the left button is depressed i.e.
  __pick-mouse-1__). __set-scroll-with-mouse__ is invoked with an argument _n_, this
  causes the mouse position to be recorded ready for a scroll. Depending on
  the scroll method, the blank lines present at the end of the buffer are
  scrolled off the screen.

  Subsequent calls to the __set-scroll-with-mouse__ are made with no argument,
  the window is scrolled by the relative displacement of the mouse from it's
  locked position, motion is limited at the end of the scrolling region.
  Scrolling is proportional to the buffer length. The command is typically
  bound to __move-mouse-1__ which results in an update whenever the mouse is
  moved by the user.

  When the button is released __drop-mouse-1__ then the scrolling is stopped by
  unbinding __move-mouse-1__, thereby breaking the binding between the mouse
  moving and the scroll command.

  The scrolling utilizes fractional mouse positional information (i.e. units
  smaller than a character cell), if available, resulting in a smoother
  scrolling motion.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example shows how the command is used.

```{.emf}
        0 define-macro mouse-scroll-pick
            1 set-scroll-with-mouse         ; Lock mouse position to scroller
            global-bind-key set-scroll-with-mouse "mouse-move-1"
        !emacro

        0 define-macro mouse-scroll-drop
            global-unbind-key "mouse-move-1"
        !emacro

        global-bind-key mouse-scroll-pick "mouse-pick-1"
        global-bind-key mouse-scroll-drop "mouse-drop-1"

```

  When the left button is 'picked', __mouse-scroll-pick__ lock the cursor to the
  mouse and binds mouse movement to __set-scroll-with-mouse__ so that whenever
  the mouse is moved the cursor will be repositioned appropriately. When the
  button is 'dropped', the mouse movement is unbound so that the cursor will
  no longer be locked to the mouse.

! 2 copy-region
## NAME


  copy-region - Copy a region of the buffer
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __copy-region__ (__esc w__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __copy-region__ copies all the characters between the cursor and the mark set
  with the [set-mark(2)](set-mark(2)) command into the kill buffer (so they can later be
  [yanked](yank(2)) elsewhere).

  If the last command also entered text into the kill buffer (or the [@cl(4)](@cl(4))
  variable is set to one of these commands) the __copy-region__ text is appended
  to the last kill.

  The numeric argument _n_ determines how the copy operates when a narrow
  region, defined by [narrow-buffer(2)](narrow-buffer(2)), is encountered. The default
  operation, when the number argument is `1`, is to copy all of the text
  contained within the narrowed region. When the numeric argument is `0` then
  narrowed region is NOT copied and the text is copied as it appears in the
  buffer.


## USAGE


  To copy text from one place to another, using the __copy-region__ command, the
  following operations are performed:

  - Move to the beginning of the text you want to copy.
  - Set the mark there with the [set-mark](set-mark(2)) (__esc-space__) command.
  - Move the point (cursor) to the end of the text.
  - Use __copy-region__ to copy the region you just defined. The text will
        be saved in the kill buffer. (If you accidentally delete the text
        use [yank](yank(2)) (C-y) immediately or [undo](undo(2)) (C-x u) to restore the text).
  - Move the point to the place you want the text to appear.
  - Use the [yank](yank(2)) (__C-y__) command to copy the text from the kill buffer to
        the current point.

  Repeat the last two steps to insert further copies of the same text.


## NOTES


  Windowing systems such as X-Windows and Microsoft Windows utilize a global
  windowing kill buffer allowing data to be moved between windowing
  applications (_cut buffer_ and _clipboard_, respectively). Within these
  environments MicroEmacs 2009 automatically interacts with the windowing
  systems kill buffer, the last MicroEmacs 2009 __copy-region__ entry is
  immediately available for a paste operation into another windowing
  application.

  The numeric argument _n_ was introduced in the '04 release.

## NAME


  count-words - Count the number of words in a region
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __count-words__ (__esc C-c__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __count-words__ Counts the number of words between the [set-mark(2)](set-mark(2)) position
  and the current cursor position. The command also gives statistics on the
  number of characters and the average characters per word. The output
  appears on the message line in a format such as:-

     `54 Words, 345 Chars, 8 Lines`

  [$result(5)]($result(5)) is set to the same output string.

! 2 create-callback
## NAME


  create-callback - Create a timer callback
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __create-callback__ "_command_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __create-callback__ creates a timer based callback command. The given _command_
  is called back in _n_ milliseconds time. This can be used by the user to
  monitor system events (such as incoming mail). The command is called only
  once, but if the command creates a callback of itself a loop is created.

  If a negative argument _n_ is given any pending callback for _command_ is
  cancelled.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example creates a callback that is invoked every 10 minutes.
```{.emf}
        define-macro Example-callback
            ml-write "It was 10 minutes since you last saw me!"
            600000 create-callback Example-callback
        !emacro
        Example-callback

```

## NOTES


  A call-back cannot interrupt while MicroEmacs is active, instead the
  call-back is delayed until MicroEmacs becomes inactive. MicroEmacs is
  considered to be inactive when it is waiting for user input, this could be
  during the execution of another macro. If a command or macro requires no
  user input then once execution has started, it cannot be interrupted by a
  call-back macro.

  The resolution of the clock is platform dependent, some platforms limit
  the minimum timer period to 10 milliseconds.

  MicroEmacs does not guarantee to service the callbacks within any set time
  constraints, the resultant callback intervals may be of a slightly
  different duration than requested.

  When a callback macro is executed, the key given by [@cck(4)](@cck(4)) is "`callback`".
  If the current buffer has a [$buffer-input(5)]($buffer-input(5)) command set, this command
  will be called instead of the callback command with __@cc__ and __@cck__ set
  appropriately. It is the responsibility of the input macro to deal with
  the callback.

! 2 list-registry
## NAME


  list-registry - Display the registry in a buffer
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __list-registry__ ["_path_"] ["_buffer_"]


## DESCRIPTION


  __list-registry__ lists the contents of the registry in the a buffer in a
  hierarchical format. The key name and any associated string is optionally
  shown as a hierarchical tree, the resultant information that is displayed
  is controlled by the numeric argument _n_ and mode of the registry node.

  The registry listing is generated in the buffer "`*registry*`" by default,
  the buffer may be modified with the _buffer_ argument.

  The numerical argument _n_ is interpreted as a bit-mask as follows:-

  _1_
  
  >  If bit `0x1` is clear then the listing buffer is specified by the
     argument _buffer_. The default (when set) used buffer `*registry*`.

  _2_
  
  >  If bit `0x2` is set the path of the root of the registry is defined by
     argument _path_. The default when clear is to list the whole registry.

  The visibility of the node is controlled by the attributes assigned by
  [mark-registry(2)](mark-registry(2)). The node value may be hidden (modes !, i and h) and are
  not displayed in the resultant listing.


## HISTORY


  The numeric argument to __list-registry__ with associated parameters and
  extended hidden modes were added in January 2005.

! 2 change-font
## NAME


  change-font - Change the screen font
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _[X-Windows]_  
  __change-font__ "_fontName_"  

  _[IBM-PC / MS-DOS]_  
  __change-font__ "_mode-no_" "_spec_"  

  _[Microsoft Windows]_  
  _n_ __change-font__ "_name_" _charSet_ _weight_ _width_ _height_


## DESCRIPTION


  __change-font__ is a platform specific command which allows the displayable
  font to be modified. The selection of font is determined by the monitor
  resolution and the capabilities of the graphics adapter.

  This command is available on all systems except termcap. While MS-DOS does
  not support the concept of different fonts, it does (or at least the
  graphics card does) support the concept of changing screen resolution,
  which has the effect of changing the font. Each platform takes different
  arguments and are considered independently, as follows:


## X-Windows 


  The X-Windows UNIX environments accept a single argument which is a fully
  qualified font name. Simply give the font X name and the font will change
  if it is available. The window size changes to attempt to retain the same
  number of rows and columns so ensure that when changing to a larger font
  then there is enough room (or a way) to resize a window which is larger
  than the actual screen.

  The X font string describes the attributes of the font in terms of it's
  size name etc. as follows:-

  > _foundry_-_family_-_weight_-_slant_-_width_--_pixels_-_point_-_hres_-_vres_-_space_-_av_-_set_

  Where

  _foundry_
 
  >  The type of foundry that digitized and supplied the font.

  _family_
  
  >  Font Family.

  _weight_
  
  >  Modifies the appearance of the font, the _weight_ is usually __medium__ or
     __bold__.

  _slant_
 
  >  Determines the orientation of the font. _slant_ is usually __r__oman
     (upright), __i__talic or __o__blique.

  _width_
 
  >  Describes the proportionate width of the font. Typical widths include
     __normal__, __condensed__, __narrow__, __double__.

  _pixels_
 
  >  Pixel size of the font

  _point_
  
  >  The resolution of the font in tenths of a __dpi__ (i.e. dpi*10)

  _hres_
  
  >  Horizontal resolution of the font in dpi.

  _vres_
  
  >  Vertical resolution of the font in dpi.

  _space_
  
  >  The spacing of the font. Typical spacing values include __m__onospaced
     (i.e. fixed width), __p__roportional and __c__haracter cell.

  _av_

  >  Mean width of all font characters, measured in tenths of a pixel.

  _set_
 
  >  Character set - character set standards e.g. __iso8859-1__.

  The default font used by MicroEmacs 2009 is

      -*-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-*-*-*-c-90-iso8859-1


  A good font to try is:

```{.emf}
     change-font "-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-*-*-*-c-80-iso8859-1"

```

  The font may also be changed in your __.Xdefaults__ file by inserting the
  line:-

      MicroEmacs.font "-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-*-*-*-c-80-iso8859-1"


## IBM-PC / MS-DOS 


  MS-DOS may only change the screen resolution, the standard screen
  resolution is either 80 columns by 25 rows or 80 by 50. A more advanced
  graphics card can typically support up to 132 by 60, MicroEmacs in theory
  has no limit but it has only been tested up to this size.

  The main problem with MS-DOS machines is that there is no standard and
  this is no exception. The graphics mode needed to get a 132 by 60 screen
  (if available) varies from one card to the next so MicroEmacs 2009 needs
  to know the graphic mode number your card uses to get your required screen
  resolution.

  MicroEmacs 2009 can also attempt a little bit of magic to double the
  number of rows on the screen for a given screen resolution. This is how 50
  lines are obtained from the standard 25 line mode 3. If the value of
  "_spec_" is non-zero then this is attempted, to the authors knowledge this
  will either work or not depending on the direction of the wind and no harm
  will befall the users equipment. However the author also quickly disclaims
  anything and everything, the user uses this at their own peril, like
  everything else.

  MicroEmacs 2009 attempts to determine the new screen width and depth
  itself, in case this fails the commands [change-frame-width(2)](change-frame-width(2)) and
  [change-frame-depth(2)](change-frame-depth(2)) may be used to correct the problem.

  Following are the standard MS-DOS text modes:

```{.emf}
        change-font "2" "0"       ; Simple monochrome or EGA monitor, 80 by 25.
        change-font "3" "0"       ; Simple EGA/VGA monitor, again 80 by 25.
        change-font "3" "1"       ; Simple EGA/VGA monitor using spec, 80 by 50.

```

  Most Trident cards support the following text mode:

```{.emf}
        change-font "86" "0"      ; Sweet 132 by 60

```

  A Diamond Stealth supports the following mode:

```{.emf}
        change-font "85" "1"      ; Nice 132 by 50

```

  Cirrus video cards (1MB) seem to support:

```{.emf}
        change-font "84" "1"      ; PT-526 (132x50)

```

  Time to start digging out your graphics card manual!


## Microsoft Windows 


  The Microsoft Windows environments utilize font files to drive the
  display. When __change-font__ is invoked with no arguments, or a negative
  argument then a font dialog is presented to the user to allow the font to
  be selected. The current font is not changed if a negative argument is
  given, in both cases the variable [$result(5)]($result(5)) is set the the user selected
  font. The format of the returned string is "`OWwwwwhhhhhFontName`", where:-

  __O__

  >  The type of character set (0 for OEM and 1 for ANSI).

  __W__
 
  >  The font weight (0 - 9).

  __wwww__

  >  The font width.

  __hhhh__
    
  >  The font height.

  __FontName__
 
  >  The font name.

  If a positive argument is specified with __change-font__ then the arguments
  are explicitly entered, arguments are defined as follows:-

  _font_
  
  >  The name of the font - maximum of 32 characters. Select Fixed mono
     fonts only. Proportional fonts may be specified but the cursor will
     not align with the characters on the screen.

  >  An empty name ("") may be specified resulting in the selection of the
     default system OEM font. No other arguments are required when
     specified.

  >  Note that __Courier New__ is not actually a fixed mono font as might be
     expected.

  _charSet_
  
  >  The type of character set required, this is an integer value of:-

              0 - ANSI or Western (True Type etc)
            161 - Greek
            162 - Turkish
            204 - Russian
            255 - OEM (or bitmapped)

  _weight_
  
  >  The weight of the font. The values are defined as:-

            0 - Don't care (Automatically selected).
            1 - Thin
            2 - Extra Light
            3 - Light
            4 - Normal
            5 - Medium
            6 - Semi-Bold
            7 - Bold
            8 - Extra-Bold
            9 - Heavy

  Note that you may request a weight and it is not honored. Typically 4
  and 7 are honored by most font definitions. 4 is typically used.

  _width_

  >  The width of the font. Specifies the average width, in logical units,
     of characters in the requested font. If this value is zero, the font
     mapper chooses a "closest match" value. The "closest match" value is
     determined by comparing the absolute values of the difference between
     the current device's aspect ratio and the digitized aspect ratio of
     available fonts.

  >  Note that if the width is specified as zero then the height should be
     specified and the width will be automatically selected.

  _height_

  >  The height of the font. Specifies the desired height, in logical
     units, of the requested font's character cell or character. (The
     character height value is the character cell height value minus the
     internal-leading value.) If this value is greater than zero, the font
     mapper matches it against available character cell height values; if
     this value is zero, the font mapper uses a default height value when
     it searches for a match; if this value is less than zero, the font
     mapper matches it against available character height values.

  >  Note: as with the weight the width and height may not be honored if
     the font cannot support the specified width/height in which case the
     closest matching height is automatically selected


## Notes on the Standard Windows Configuration 


  For releases prior to '99, the __Terminal__ font is the standard MS-DOS font
  used for the MS-DOS window. This is an OEM fixed width character set which
  contains all of the conventional symbols found in the DOS shell.

  Releases of MicroEmacs post '99 may utilise any of the windows fonts,
  typically `Courier New` or `Lucida Console` are used, these provide the best
  screen rendering of characters. `Lucida Console` is slightly better with a
  smaller font size as this allows a '`1`' (one) and '`l`' (lower case L) to be
  distinguished.

  The __Terminal__ fonts are the same as shown in the DOS window the last 2
  arguments are the width x height, the terminal equivalents (Bit Mapped)
  are commented here.

  __7x12__
  
  >  Regular weight seems to offer the best resolution for 14/15" monitors.

  __6x8__
 
  >  Regular weight is more suitable for 17-21" monitors which offer better
     resolutions.

  The best options for the fonts are defined as follows:-

```{.emf}
        ;Standard Terminal Fonts - standard weight
        ;change-font "Terminal" 0 4  4  6
        change-font "Terminal" 0 4  6  8
        ;change-font "Terminal" 0 4  8  8
        ;change-font "Terminal" 0 4  5 12
        ;change-font "Terminal" 0 4  7 12
        ;change-font "Terminal" 0 4  8 12
        ;change-font "Terminal" 0 4 12 16
        ;change-font "Terminal" 0 4 10 18

        ;Standard Terminal Fonts - heavy weight
        ;change-font "Terminal" 0 7  4  6
        ;change-font "Terminal" 0 7  6  8
        ;change-font "Terminal" 0 7  8  8
        ;change-font "Terminal" 0 7  5 12
        ;change-font "Terminal" 0 7  7 12
        ;change-font "Terminal" 0 7  8 12
        ;change-font "Terminal" 0 7 12 16
        ;change-font "Terminal" 0 7 10 18

```

  The "__Courier New__" font is not actually a fixed mono font as might be
  expected.

                       interactive menu if no arguments are given

  __change-font-xfontsel__  allow to chose the font if the X11 tool  xfontself
                        is installed
    
  The font-size is increased in case of C-+ and decreased in case of the C--
  minus    key     bindings.     For    Unix    systems    the     variables
  [.change-font.sz-font(5)](.change-font.sz-font(5)) and [.change-font.sz-size(5)](.change-font.sz-size(5))  are  used to cycle
  through two standard fonts, Adobe courier and  lucidatypewriter.  The user
  can define  their own short fonts using just the family and the weight and
  give the their list of available sizes through which they like to cycle through. 

## EXAMPLE

```{.emf}
        ; Call to change the resize font to Ubuntu mono bold
        ; could be placed in your user.emf file
        ; arguments are: short font-string (family-weigth) startsize
        change-font-type ; interactice selection from courier, lucida etc
        ; change-font-type "ubuntu mono-bold" 22
        ; change-font-type "courier" ; should always work
        ; change-font-type "lucidatypewriter" - should always work
```

## SYNOPSIS


  _[X-Windows, Microsoft Windows]_  
  _n_ __change-font-size__  
  _1_ __change-font-size__  (__C-+__)      
  _-1_ __change-font-size__  (__C--__)         
  _0_ __change-font-size__  (__C-=__)      
  set-variable  _.change-font.sz-font_  "_fontname_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __change-font-size__  is a command  which  allows to resize the  current
  MicroEmacs font using standard key-bindings, `C-+`, `C--` and `C-=`.
  The font-size is increased in case of `C-+` and decreased in case of the `C--`
  minus key  bindings.  For Unix systems the  variables   [.change-font.sz-font(5)](.change-font.sz-font(5))
  and [.change-font.sz-size(5)](.change-font.sz-size(5)) are used to cycle through some standard (Adobe
  courier and Lucidatypewriter) fonts  or through a list of user  defined  fonts. On Windows  simply
  the current font-size of the current font is changed.

! 2 prefix
## NAME

|prefix
    prefix - Key prefix command
|prefix2
    prefix2 - Control(2) prefix
|prefix3
    prefix3 - Control(3) prefix
|prefix4
    prefix4 - Control(4) prefix
$a


## SYNOPSIS


    n prefix

    Default prefix bindings:

    prefix 1 (esc)
    prefix 2 (C-x)
    prefix 3 (C-h)
    prefix 4 (C-c)


## DESCRIPTION


  prefix sets up to 8 prefix key sequences, allowing two stroke key
  bindings. The command does not do anything, it is used to create double
  barrel key bindings such as such as [goto-line(2)](goto-line(2)) (esc g). This binding may
  be redefined, redefining ALL meta bindings. If the meta bindings are not
  required the command should first be unbound using the
  [global-unbind-key(2)](global-unbind-key(2)).

  The prefix key can only be defined using the [global-bind-key(2)](global-bind-key(2)), passing
  the command the prefix number required, for example:

```{.emf}
        1 global-bind-key "prefix" "esc "
        2 global-bind-key "prefix" "C-x"

```

  Binds the first prefix to the Escape key and the second prefix to
  Control-x.

  The first prefix key (__prefix 1__) differs from the other prefixes since it
  permits entry of the numeric argument at the message line, e.g. "esc 1 0  C-f"
  will move forward 10 characters.
  

## NOTES


  Invocating this command via [execute-named-command(2)](execute-named-command(2)) or by a macro has no
  effect. It can be bound to only one key sequence which must be a single
  key stroke such as __C-x__ etc. Re-binding the command to another key will not
  only unbind the new key but also the current __prefix ?__ key bindings.

! 2 define-macro
## NAME


  define-macro - Define a new macro
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __define-macro__ _macro-name_  
     _Macro body_  
  __!emacro__


## DESCRIPTION


  __define-macro__ starts the definition of an macro named _macro-name_, only used
  within macro files or buffers. After the above header line, the body of
  the macro is added, one command or expression on a line. The macro
  definition is completed by the [!emacro](!emacro(4)) directive.

  The numeric argument _n_, specified as zero, defines the macro as private
  such that it does not appear on a command completion list. A zero argument
  is generally used on helper macro's that form part of a larger macro. If
  the argument is omitted, or non-zero, then the macro appears in the
  command completion list.

  See [execute-file(2)](execute-file(2)) for a complete definition and examples of the
  MicroEmacs 2009 macro language.

  Once the macro has been defined, it becomes indistinguishable from a
  standard MicroEmacs 2009 command, i.e. [execute-named-command(2)](execute-named-command(2)) (`esc x`)
  can be used to execute the macro and [global-bind-key(2)](global-bind-key(2)) can be used to
  globally bind the command to a key combination.

  There are no restrictions on the number of macros that may be defined,
  provided that the name space is managed properly. Consideration must be
  given as to when any additional macros that are created are loaded into
  MicroEmacs 2009. We usually like start-up to be rapid and macros are
  loaded as and when requested by the user, or by the buffer hooks as new
  files are loaded (see [add-file-hook(2)](add-file-hook(2)) and [define-macro-file(2)](define-macro-file(2))).

  User defined macros may be documented with on-line help by including a
  [define-help(2)](define-help(2)) construct within the macro file.


## EXAMPLE


  The following are two standard macros provided with MicroEmacs 2009. The
  first is a macro called __clean__, this strips trailing white space from the
  ends of lines in a file and removes blank lines from the end of the file.

```{.emf}
        define-macro clean
            ;
            ; Prepare to clean up file.
            ; Remember line & magic mode
            set-variable #l0 $window-line
            set-variable #l1 &not &bmod magic
            !if #l1
                1 buffer-mode "magic"
            !endif
            ;
            ; Get rid of trailing white space on EOL
            beginning-of-buffer
            replace-string "[\t ]+$" "\\0"
            beginning-of-buffer
            replace-string "[ ]+\t" "\t"
            ;
            ; Strip trailing blank lines.
            end-of-buffer
            backward-line
            !while &and &gre $window-line 1 &sequal @wc "\n"
                kill-line
                backward-line
            !done
            ;
            ; Clean up - restore buffer modes etc.
            ; Move back to starting line & restore original magic mode
            !force goto-line #l0
            !if #l1
                -1 buffer-mode "magic"
            !endif
            screen-update
            ml-write "Cleaned up file."
        !emacro

```

  The second example converts all of the `<tab>` characters in the file to
  their `<SPACE>` character equivalent.

```{.emf}
        ;
        ; tabs-to-spaces.
        ; Convert all of the tabs to spaces.
        define-macro tabs-to-spaces
            ; Remember line
            set-variable #l0 $window-line
            beginning-of-buffer
            !force search-forward "\t"
            !while $status
                set-variable #l1 $window-acol
                backward-delete-char
                &sub #l1 $window-acol insert-space
                !force search-forward "\t"
            !done
            goto-line #l0
            screen-update
            ml-write "[Converted tabs]"
        !emacro

```

  Both of these commands are available from the command line, they are
  indistinguishable from the built in commands.

  Macros may also be nested, as shown in the next example, this macro
  contains a __define-macro__ within itself, when executed the macro creates
  another macro dynamically - dynamic macros are generally given a prefix of
  __%__ and are highlighted differently in [describe-bindings(2)](describe-bindings(2)).

  The following example is taken from the [alarm(3)](alarm(3)) macro, executing __alarm__
  the user is prompted for a message, and the time interval before the alarm
  expires in hours and minutes. It then creates a new macro with a callback
  so that the new macro will be called at the correct time.

```{.emf}
        !if &seq %alarm-numb "ERROR"
            set-variable %alarm-numb 0
            set-variable %osd-alarm &pinc %osd 1
        !endif

        define-macro alarm
            set-variable %alarm-numb &add %alarm-numb 1
            set-variable #l0 &cat "%alarm-" %alarm-numb
            !force set-variable #l2 @3
            !if &not $status
                set-variable &ind #l0 @ml "Message"
                set-variable #l1 @ml "Hours"
                set-variable #l2 @ml "Minutes"
            !else
                set-variable &ind #l0 @1
                set-variable #l1 @2
            !endif
            set-variable #l1 &mul 60000 &add &mul 60 #l1 #l2
            define-macro #l0
                !bell
                set-variable #l0 &add &len &ind @0 10
                osd %osd-alarm 0 "bat" 9 3
                osd %osd-alarm 1 ""
                osd %osd-alarm 2 "c" "ALARM"
                osd %osd-alarm 3 ""
                osd %osd-alarm 4 "" &ind @0
                osd %osd-alarm 5 ""
                osd %osd-alarm 6 "Bcf" " OK " f void
                %osd-alarm osd
            !emacro
            #l1 create-callback #l0
        !emacro

```

## SYNOPSIS

## DESCRIPTION


  __delete-blank-lines__ deletes all the blank lines before and after the
  current cursor position. Note that the deleted lines are not added to a
  kill buffer.

## NAME


  delete-buffer - Delete a buffer
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __delete-buffer__ "_buffer-name_" (__C-x k__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __delete-buffer__ disposes of buffer _buffer-name_ in the editor and reclaim the
  memory. This does not delete the file that the buffer was read from.

  If the buffer has been edited and its name does not start with a '__*__' then
  the user is prompted as to whether the changes should be discarded. Also
  if the buffer has an active process running in it then confirmation is
  sort from the user before the process is killed.

  The argument _n_ can be used to change the default behavior of delete-buffer
  described above, _n_ is a bit based flag where:-

  __0x01__
  
  >  Enables loss of work checks (default). These include a check that the
     buffer has not been modified, if so the user is prompted. Also if a
     process is running then user must confirm that the process can be
     killed. If this flag is not supplied then the buffer is killed without
     any user prompts (useful in macros).

! 2 directory-tree
## NAME


  directory-tree - Draw the file directory tree
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __directory-tree__ ["_directory_"]


## DESCRIPTION


  __directory-tree__ creates or manipulates a view of the file systems directory
  structure. The command is quite complex to use directly so is largely used
  but macros such as [file-browser(3)](file-browser(3)).

  The argument _n_ is a bit based flag which is used to control the command,
  where the bits have the following meaning:-

  __0x01__
  
  >  If set, the focal directory of the command is set by the given
     "_directory_" argument. Otherwise the argument is not required and the
     command must be executed within the "_*directory*_" buffer; the current
     line sets the focal directory.

  __0x02__
  
  >  Specifies that the current line in resultant "_*directory*_" window
     should be set to the focal directory. If this bit is not set then the
     current line will be the last selected directory, or if none have been
     selected, the first line in the buffer.

  __0x04__

  >  Specifies that any evaluations required during the commands operation
     should be performed. Without this flag an open operation on a
     directory which has not previously been evaluated will not be perform
     an evaluation and the results will likely be incomplete.

  __0x08__

  >  Specifies that the current focal directory should be opened. This
     means that sub-directories within the current focal directory will
     also be drawn in the directory tree.

  __0x10__
  
  >  Specifies that the current focal directory should be closed. This
     means that sub-directories within the current focal directory will not
     be drawn in the directory tree.

  __0x20__

  >  Specifies that the current focal directory's open state should be
     toggled. This means that if the sub-directories are currently hidden
     they will now be drawn and vice-versa.

  __0x40__

  >   When specified any directory opened will be re-evaluated, ensuring the
     accuracy of the information.

  __0x80__
 
  >  Enables a recursive behavior, for example if this flag was specified
     with the open then not only will the focal directory be opened, but
     all of it's children, and their children etc. Note that if the
     Evaluation flag is not specified then only the already evaluated
     directories can be opened.

  directory-tree creates a new buffer "_*directory*_" and draws the known
  directory tree. Every drawn directory is preceded by a character flag
  giving the user an indication of the directory state, where:

  __?__
  
  >  Directory has not been evaluated.

  __-__
 
  >  Directory has been evaluated and is visible.

  __+__
  
  >  Directory has been evaluated but is currently hidden.

  Directories which have been evaluated and found to have no children use
  the '-' [$box-chars(5)]($box-chars(5)) instead of a '-' character.

  On UNIX platforms, if a directory is a symbolic link to another directory,
  the link name is given after the directory name.


## EXAMPLE


  The best example of the use of directory-tree is [file-browser(3)](file-browser(3)) which can
  be found in hkdirlst.emf.

! 2 indent
## NAME


  indent - Manage the auto-indentation methods
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _0_ __indent__ "_ind-no_" "_flags_" [ "_look-back_" ] [ "_indent-scheme_" ]  
  __indent__ "_ind-no_" "_type_" "_token_" [ "_close_" "_ignore_" ] [ "_indent_" ]  
  __indent__ "_ind-no_" "__t__" "_token_" [ "_token_" ] "_indent-scheme_"  
  __indent__ "_ind-no_" "__x__" | "__w__" "_token_" "_indent_" "_indent-scheme_"


## DESCRIPTION


  The __indent__  command creates and manages the  auto-indenting  methods, the
  process of creating a new  indentation  method is best described in 
  [Language Templates](languageTemplates(2))  The command  takes various forms as defined
  by the arguments. Each of the argument configurations is defined as follows:-


## Indentation Method Creation 


  _0_ __indent__ "_ind-no_" "_flags_" "_look-back_" [ "_indent-scheme_" ]

  With an argument of `0`, __indent__ creates a new indentation method with the
  integer handle _ind-no_. The indentation method is assigned to a buffer by
  setting [$buffer-indent(5)]($buffer-indent(5)) to _ind-no_. _ind-no_ cannot be 0 as setting
  __$buffer-indent__ to zero disables indentation. If the indentation method
  with the same _ind-no_ already exists, then the existing method is deleted
  and a new method may be created.

  _flags_ Sets the indent bit flags where:-

  `0x01`
  
  >  Indent method is case insensitive. Note that __indent__ tokens must be
     specified in lower case.

  `0x02`
  
  >  Defines a __fast look-back__ indentation scheme to be used in conjunction
     with the current indentation scheme. The fast look-back scheme is used
     to identify a change in the current buffer's indent scheme, for
     example the starting of embedded script in html. The _indent-scheme_
     argument is required when this flag bit is set and identifies the
     handle of the fast look-back indentation scheme to be used.

  >  This feature is only used when indent is required to support multiple
     complex indentation schemes within a single file, for example
     indentation of scripts within html, asp or php pages etc. When defined
     the given _indent-scheme_ must also be defined using __indent__, the
     scheme's _look-back_ argument is typically set to look back a long way
     to ensure correctness, i.e. 500 lines, but it should therefore contain
     few tokens to maintain performance.

  `0x04`
  
  >  Defines C mode of indentation. C styling is built into the editor and
     is enabled through the __indent__ command. The C form is discussed in more
     detail in the next section.

  `0x08`
  
  >  Ring the bell if [goto-matching-fence(2)](goto-matching-fence(2)) fails.

  `0x10`
  
  >  Comment continuation mode. This is only valid when C mode is defined
     and is defined further in the next section.

  _look-back_ specifies the maximum number of lines, prior to the current
  line, considered when calculating the indentation of a line, i.e. if there
  are _look-back_ number of lines between the line to be indented and the
  previous non-blank line then the current indentation is lost.

  If _look-back_ is set to 0 then the indentation is effectively disabled as
  the current indentation can never be found. The maximum value has been
  increase as of January 2004 from 255 to an integer (large number), a value
  of 10 is typically sufficient for a normal indent scheme and 500 for a
  fast look-back scheme.


## C Indentation 


  _0_ __indent__ "_ind-no_" "_flags_"  
  __indent__ "_ind-no_" `s` "_statement_"  
  __indent__ "_ind-no_" `c` "_continue_"  
  __indent__ "_ind-no_" `x` "_max_"  
  __indent__ "_ind-no_" `b` "_brace_"  
  __indent__ "_ind-no_" `e` "_braceStatement_"  
  __indent__ "_ind-no_" `w` "_switch_"  
  __indent__ "_ind-no_" `a` "_case_"  
  __indent__ "_ind-no_" `m` "_margin_"  
  __indent__ "_ind-no_" `u` "_comcont_"  

  C mode is built into the editor by default and is enabled by setting the
  indent intialization flag bit `0x04`. With this bit enabled then the
  indentation for 'C' mode is defined through the additional arguments.
  _ind-no_ and _flags_ have the same meaning as defined in the previous section.
  C mode is typically initialized with the value 12. The remaining C
  arguments are defined as follows:

  __indent__ "_ind-no_" "`s`" "_statement_" (=t)
 
  >  The indent of the current line is derived from _statement_ value plus
     the indent of the last c token (_if_, _else_, _while_ etc.) or the last '`{`'
     (which ever was found first). i.e. if the last '`{`' was found at column
     16 then the current line will be indented to 20:-

                    {
                        xxxxxxxxxx
                        xxxxxxxxxx


     or

                    if(xxxxx)
                        xxxxxxxxxx


  C tokens are only used to indent the next line, whereas '`{`' are used
  in indenting every line to it's partnering '`}`'.

  __indent__ "_ind-no_" "`c`" "_continue_" (=3/2t)
  
  >  _continue_ sets the indent to be added to a split line, i.e. for an
     indent of 20, a continued statement would be indented to 30. A
     continued statement is a single c statement which is spread over 2 or
     more lines, the 2nd and any following lines would be indented to 30.
     For example

                    thisIsAVeryLongVariableWhichMeansAssignmentsAreSplit =
                              ThisIsTheFirstContinuedStatementLine +
                              ThisIsTheSecondContinuedStatementLine + etc ;


  >  The indent is changed if there is an open bracket, continued
     statements are indented to the depth of the open bracket plus one,
     e.g.

                    func(firstFuncArg,
                         secondFuncArg,
                         anotherBracketForFun(firstAnotherBracketForFunArg,
                                              secondAnotherBracketForFunArg),
                         thirdFuncArg) ;


  __indent__ "_ind-no_" "`x`" "_max_"

  >  _max_ sets an upper limit of the indentation where an open bracket is
     encountered, in the case where the leading indent of the function name
     and open bracket exceeds _max_, then the continuation is reduced to the
     continuation indent.

  >  The effect of _max_ is described as follows; if _max_ is set to a large
     value then the default open brace offset appearence is:-

  The standard indent rule for setting up C and Java is defined as:-

```{.emf}
            0 indent .hilight.c 12
            indent .hilight.c "s" t     ; Default may be omitted
            indent .hilight.c "e" t     ; Default may be omitted
            indent .hilight.c "c" 3/2t  ; Default may be omitted
            indent .hilight.c "x" 0     ; Default may be omitted
            indent .hilight.c "b" 0     ; Default may be omitted
            indent .hilight.c "w" 0     ; Default may be omitted
            indent .hilight.c "a" -t    ; Default may be omitted
            indent .hilight.c "m" -1    ; Default may be omitted
            indent .hilight.c "u" " * "

```

  This is typically written with the defaults omitted.

```{.emf}
            0 indent .hilight.c 12
            indent .hilight.c "u" " * "

```
  If GNU Emacs indentation is required then the following definition may be
  used:-

```{.emf}
            0 indent .hilight.c 12            ; if (a == b)
            indent .hilight.c "e" t           ;   {
            indent .hilight.c "b" t           ;     c = d;
            indent .hilight.c "s" t           ;   }
            indent .hilight.c "u" " * "

```

  The default configuration scheme is defined as:-

```{.emf}
            0 indent .hilight.c 12            ; if (a == b)
            indent .hilight.c "e" t           ; {
            indent .hilight.c "b" 0           ;   c = d;
            indent .hilight.c "s" t           ; }
            indent .hilight.c "u" " * "

```

  Where comments are to be aligned at the end of a statement then the margin
  parameter may be defined in `<user>.emf`.

```{.emf}
            indent .hilight.c "m" 40

```

## Indentation Rule Creation 


  __indent__ "_ind-no_" "_type_" "_token_" [ "_close_" [ "_ignore_" ]] [ "_indent_" ] [
  "_indent2_" ] [ "_indent-scheme_" ]

  With the default argument of `1`, __indent__ creates a new rule for the
  indentation method _ind-no_ which must have previously been defined and
  initialized.

  The indentation of a line in a buffer, which is using an indentation
  method, is affected by the token types matched on the line (_type_ `f`, `o`, `s`)
  and the current indentation (if line is not of type `f`).

  The current indentation is determined by searching the previous lines
  (look-back) for the indentation of the last indented line. This may not
  simply be the indentation of the last non-blank line, the exact
  indentation is determined by searching for tokens in the line and
  assessing their effect on the indentation of the current line.

  The format of the regex valid in the "_token_" and "_close_" arguments are the
  same as at used by hilight token creation, see [hilight(2)](hilight(2)) for more
  information.

  The _indent_ argument specifies the indent to apply in characters. The
  indent may be specified as a literal integer value, a positive value
  increases the indent a negative value reduces the indent. The _indent_ may
  be specified in terms of buffer specific generic value
  [$buffer-indent-width(5)]($buffer-indent-width(5)) using the value t, indicating a tab width. The
  value of __t__ may be prefixed with a signed integer or vulgar fraction which
  adjusts the size of the indentation width by the appropriate amount.
  Modifying the value of [$buffer-indent-width]($indent-width(5)) modifies the indent width that
  is applied allowing the indentation method to be specified independently
  of the indentation width.

  The indent tokens may be assigned one of the following types, using the
  _type_ argument. If the type is specified in upper case then the token must
  be surrounded by non-alpha-numeric characters:

  __Fixed__ (_type_ = '`f`' or '`F`')

  >  A line containing a fixed indent token will be indented to the given
     _indent_ column from the left-hand edge. _indent_ is the only argument
     specified. e.g. MicroEmacs macro `!goto` labels:-

```{.emf}
            indent .hilight.emf f "*" 0

```
  
  >  producing

                .....
            *label
                .....


  >   The fixed token must be the first non-white character on the line, the
     rest of the line is ignored. The indentation of the previous line has
     no effect.

  __Indent-from-next-line-onward__ (_type_ = '`n`' or '`N`')

  >  The indentation changes by _indent_ from the next line onwards from the
     current line. _indent_ is the only argument specified. e.g. MicroEmacs
     macro `!if`:-

```{.emf}
            indent .hilight.emf n "!if" t

```

  >  Keeps the indentation of the `!if` line the same as the previous
     indentation, change the indentation on the following lines by an extra
     [$buffer-indent-width]($indent-width(5)) characters, to produce:

            ....
            !if
                ....


  __Indent-from-current-line-onward__ (_type_ = '`o`' or '`O`')

  >  Increment the current and following lines indentation by _indent_.
     _indent_ is the only argument specified. e.g. MicroEmacs macro `!endif`

```{.emf}
            indent .hilight.emf o "!endif" -t

```

  >  decrement the indent of the `!endif` line and following lines by
     [$buffer-indent-width]($indent-width(5)) spaces producing:

                ....
            !endif
            ....


  __Universal-indent__ (_type_ = '`u`' or '`U`')

  >  Independent control of the current line and next line indent.
     Increment the current line indentation by _indent_ and the following
     line indentation by _indent2_. Where _indent_ represents indent with the `o`
     option and _indent2_ represents indent with the `n` option. This command
     is useful where the indentation of both the current and next line need
     to be controlled independently given a single token.

```{.emf}
            indent .hilight.emf u "<cfelse" -t 3/2t

```

  >  This has been used in the _ColdFusion_ indentation to control the
     `<cfelse>` condition which requires control of both the current line and
     next line with different values from the same token. Note that a
     __Indent-single__ could be implemented with this command using an argument
     of `-t t`.

  __Indent-single__ (_type_ = '`s`' or '`S`')

  >  Changes the indentation of the current line ONLY by _indent_. _indent_ is
     the only argument specified. e.g. MicroEmacs macro `!elif`:-

```{.emf}
            indent .hilight.emf o "!elif" -t

```

  >  decrements the indentation of the `!elif` line by [$buffer-indent-width]($indent-width(5))
     characters, but restores the previous indentation after the current
     line, producing:

                ....
            !elif
                ....


  __Bracket__ (_type_ = '`b`' or '`B`')

  >  A bracket should be used when a starting token pairs with a closing
     token which may span multiple lines. i.e. the opening and closing
     braces of a programming language. Note that the opening and closing
     tokens must be different otherwise they cannot be differentiated. A
     bracket has two main effects:

  >  When the previous line has an unmatched open bracket
  
            In this situation the current line is indented to the right of the
            mismatched bracket.

  >  When the previous line has an unmatched close bracket
   
            In this situation the matching open bracket is hunted for in
            previous lines until either the look-back limit (See Indentation
            Method Creation) is exhausted or the bracket is matched, in which
            case the indent of that line is used.

  >   For a bracket the only other argument given is the _close_. e.g. tcl's
     '`(`' and '`)`' brackets

```{.emf}
            indent .hilight.tcl b "(" ")"

```

  >  Which produces:

            ....
            .... (....
                  ....
                  ....)
            ....


  __Continue__ (_type_ = '`c`' or '`C`')
  
  >  Indicates that when _token_ is found on the current line, the next line
     is a continuation of the current line. The indentation of the next
     line is the indentation of the first continuation line plus the given
     _indent_. _indent_ is the only argument specified. e.g. tcl's '\'

```{.emf}
            indent .hilight.tcl c "\\" 3/2t

```
  
  >  A simple example is

            ....
            12345678901234567890      \
                     ....
            ....


  >  When used in conjunction with brackets, the following effect is
     observed:

            ....
            12345678901234567890      \
                      ....(....       \
                           ....)      \
                      ....            \
                      ....
            ....


  >  This shows why the first continuation line (the `123456...` line) must
     be located and used as the base line from which the indentation is
     derived; again the _look-back_ limits the search for this line.

  __Exclusion__ (_type_ = '`e`' or '`E`')
  
  >  Used to exclude text between start _token_ and _close_ token from the
     indentation calculation, typically used for quotes. The _ignore_
     argument is also specified (see [hilight(2)](hilight(2)) `type 0x004` type bracket)
     e.g. MicroEmacs macro quotes:-

```{.emf}
            indent .hilight.emf e "\"" "\"" "\\"

```
  
  >  e.g. tcl's quotes

```{.emf}
            indent .hilight.tcl e "\"" "\"" "\\"

```

  >  producing:-

            ....
            ".... ignore { ... \" ... ignore another { token ... "
            ....


  __Ignore__ (_type_ = '`i`' or '`I`')
  
  >  Text to the right of a line containing _token_ is to be ignored;
     typically used for comments. e.g. MicroEmacs macro '`;`' comment:-

```{.emf}
            indent .hilight.emf i ";"

```

  >  Or tcl's '`#`' comment

```{.emf}
            indent .hilight.tcl i "#"

```

  >  producing

            ....
            # ... ignore this { indent token
            ....


  __Type__ (_type_ = '`t`' or '`T`')
 
  >  Used in a __fast look-back__ indentation scheme (see bit `0x02` of __0 indent__
     above) to define the scheme change tokens. The fast look-back token
     typically shadows the `x` and `w` types and identifies the indentation
     scheme. The token itself does not change the indentation, it simply
     identifies the indentation scheme. The '`x`' or '`w`' types are used to
     perform the actual indentation of the line if required.

  >  If the _indent-scheme_ is defined as zero (`0`) then the indentation
     scheme is set to the same value as the [$buffer-indent(5)]($buffer-indent(5)) variable.

  >  The following example is taken from the XML language definition . A
     fast-look back scheme is used (`hilight.xmlT`) to search for the
     alternative indentation schemes for _javascript_ and _vbscript_. The `t`
     indent type defines the start of script tokens and to switch the
     indentation to the new indent type.

```{.emf}

  __Change__ (_type_ = [`x`|`X`|`w`|`W`|`v`|`V`])
  
  >  Change the indentation scheme from the current scheme to the new
     _indent-scheme_. If the _indent-scheme_ is specified as zero (`0`) then the
     indentation scheme is set to the same handle value as the
     [$buffer-indent(5)]($buffer-indent(5)) variable. indent specifies the indent value, when
     the _type_ is `w` then the current line onwards is indented (similar to
     `o`), a _type_ of `x` indents the next line onwards (similar to `n`), a _type_
     of `v` indents both the current line and next time onwards (similar to
     `u`).

  >  Refer the the _type_=`t` for an example of indentation switching.


## EXAMPLE


  Examples of indentation method creations can be found in macro files
  `hkemf.emf`, `hktcl.emf` and `hkvrml.emf`. The following example is taken from
  `hkemf.emf`:-

```{.emf}
        !if &not &exist .hilight.emf
            set-variable .hilight.emf &pinc .hilight.next 1
        !endif

        ...

        0 indent  .hilight.emf 0 10
        indent .hilight.emf N "define-macro" t
        indent .hilight.emf n "!if" t
        indent .hilight.emf s "!eli" -t
        indent .hilight.emf s "!els" -t
        indent .hilight.emf o "!end" -t
        indent .hilight.emf n "!whi" t
        indent .hilight.emf o "!don" -t
        indent .hilight.emf n "!rep" t
        indent .hilight.emf o "!until" -t
        indent .hilight.emf o "!ema" -t
        indent .hilight.emf e "\"" "\"" "\\"
        indent .hilight.emf i ";"
        indent .hilight.emf f "*" 0

```

  Note that a __.hilight__ command variable is typically used as a buffer with
  indentation rules will almost certainly have hilighting and the same
  variable is used to define the hilighting scheme.


## NOTES


  The variables [$indent-width(5)]($indent-width(5)), [$buffer-indent-width(5)]($buffer-indent-width(5)) and the __t__ indent
  notation were introduced in the November 2004 version of MicroEmacs.

  The electric C mode __cmode(2m)__ was removed in December 2004, as were the
  variables __$c-brace(5)__, __$c-case(5)__, __$c-contcomm(5)__, __$c-continue(5)__,
  __$c-margin(5)__ and __$c-statement(5)__. All replaced by the C Indent
  initialisation method.

  The Universal indent (`u`) was introduced in the 2006 release.

! 2 forward-delete-char
! 2 backward-delete-char
## NAME


|forward-delete-char
  forward-delete-char - Delete next character at the cursor position
|backward-delete-char
  backward-delete-char - Delete previous character at the cursor position
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __forward-delete-char__ (__C-d__)  
  _n_ __backward-delete-char__ (__backspace__)  


## DESCRIPTION


  __forward-delete-char__ deletes the next _n_ characters from the current cursor
  position. If the cursor is at the end of a line, the next line is joined
  onto the end of the current line. If a numeric argument is given the
  character(s) are added to the kill buffer, otherwise the kill buffer
  remains unaltered.

  __backward-delete-char__ deletes the next _n_ characters immediately to the left
  of the cursor (e.g. more conventionally backspace). If the cursor is at
  the beginning of a line, this joins the current line to the end of the
  previous line. If an argument is given then the character is added to the
  kill buffer, otherwise the kill buffer remains unaltered.

  Where the numeric argument is `0` the command has no effect. A negative
  argument changes the direction.


## NOTES


  __forward-delete-char__ is also bound to __delete__ and __S-delete__.

  __backward-delete-char__ is also bound to __S-backspace__.


## HISTORY


  As of December 2004 the mode __letter(2m)__ which controlled whether the
  deleted character is added to the kill buffer was removed. Letter mode
  used to be disabled by default, the behavior of the old letter mode, when
  enabled, may be achieved through the key bindings:-

```{.emf}
        1 global-bind-key backward-delete-char "backspace"
        1 global-bind-key forward-delete-char "delete"

```
 
  The use of the numeric argument of 1 in the global binding has the has the
  same effect as the existing __letter(2m)__ mode (when enabled).

## NAME


|forward-kill-word
  forward-kill-word - Delete next word at the cursor position
|backward-kill-word
  backward-kill-word - Delete previous word at the cursor position
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __forward-kill-word__ (__esc d__)  
  _n_ __backward-kill-word__ (__esc backspace__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __forward-kill-word__ deletes the next _n_ words starting at the current cursor
  position, the deleted text is added to the kill buffer. See
  [forward-word(2)](forward-word(2)) for a description of word boundaries. If no argument n is
  given and the current character is a non-word character then only the
  characters from the current position to the start of the next word are
  removed. If the argument _n_ is `0` the command has no effect. If a negative
  argument is specified, _n_ words are deleted backwards (i.e. this is the
  same as __-n backward-kill-word__).

  __backward-kill-word__ deletes the previous _n_ words before the cursor, the
  deleted text is added to the kill buffer. The numeric argument has the
  same effect as with __forward-kill-word__.


## NOTES


  __backward-kill-word__ is also bound to __esc backspace__.

  The negative argument is typically used by macro scripts where the kill
  buffer is more precisely controlled.


## HISTORY


  The interpretation of the numeric argument was changed in the 2005 release
  to kill _n_ words in a forwards or backwards direction. In previous releases
  then the negative argument controlled the kill buffer behavior. If kill
  buffer control is required then [kill-region(2)](kill-region(2)) should be used instead.

! 2 delete-window
! 2 delete-other-windows
## NAME


|delete-window
  delete-window - Delete the current window
|delete-other-windows
  delete-other-windows - Delete other windows
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __delete-window__ (__C-x 0__)  
  _n_ __delete-other-windows__ (__C-x 1__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __delete-window__ attempts to delete the current window (remove window from
  the screen), retrieving the lines for use in the window adjacent to it.
  The command fails if there is no other window or if the current window is
  protected from deletion (see [$window-flags(5)]($window-flags(5))). The deletion protection
  can be overridden by giving the command a numerical argument _n_ of 2.

  The window deletion policy is determined by the formation of the windows
  displayed on the screen. The bias is for the _previous_ window (above) the
  current window to be merged when split vertically, and for the left window
  to be merged when split horizontally.

  __delete-other-windows__ deletes all of the other windows, the current window
  becomes the only window, using the entire available screen area. Windows
  can be protected from deletion by using the [$window-flags]($window-flags(5)) variable, giving
  the command a numerical argument _n_ of 2 overrides this protection.

! 2 describe-bindings
## NAME


  describe-bindings - Show current command/key binding
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __describe-bindings__ (__C-h b__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __describe-bindings__ pops up a window with a list of all the named commands,
  and the keys currently bound to them. Each entry is formatted as:

     __keyCode__ `...........` __command__

  __describe-bindings__ is buffer context sensitive and shows the bindings for
  the currently active buffer (i.e. the buffer that is active when the
  command is invoked). The resultant command list is divided into three
  sections as follows:

  __Buffer Bindings__
  
  >  The bindings for the active buffer when __describe-bindings__ was invoked.
     These are the buffer bindings set by [buffer-bind-key(2)](buffer-bind-key(2)).

  __Ml Bindings__
  
  >  The message line bindings as set by [ml-bind-key(2)](ml-bind-key(2)).

  __Global Bindings__
 
  >  Global binding of keys as set by [global-bind-key(2)](global-bind-key(2)).


## EXAMPLE


  The following is an example of the displayed output from
  __describe-bindings__. This was invoked while editing buffer __m2fun038.2__ which
  is the __Nroff__ file for this manual page; the local bindings for the buffer
  are all Nroff related.

## NAME


  describe-key - Report keyboard key name and binding
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __describe-key__ (__C-x ?__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __describe-key__ allows a key to be typed and it will report the name of the
  command bound to that key (if any) and the internal key-code. This command
  is useful when trying to locate the identity of keyboard keys for binding.


## NOTES


  __describe-key__ is also bound to __C-h k__.

! 2 describe-variable
## NAME


  describe-variable - Describe current setting of a variable
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __describe-variable__ (__C-h v__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __describe-variable__ describes the current setting of the given variable (__%__,
  __:__ and __$__ variables), returning `ERROR` if the variable is undefined. If a `$`
  variable is not found then it is tested for an environment variable, i.e.

```{.emf}
        describe-variable $PATH

```

  returns your environment `$PATH` setting. This is the easiest and best way
  of determining the current platform from within a Macro file.

  The returned value of any undefined variable is the string `ERROR`.


## NOTES


  Completion is enabled on the command line for variable names.

! 2 delete-dictionary
## NAME


  delete-dictionary - Remove a spelling dictionary from memory
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __delete-dictionary__ ["_dictionary_"]


## DESCRIPTION


  __delete-dictionary__ removes the given _dictionary_ from memory, where _n_ is a
  bitwise flag determining the removal mode, defined as follows:-

  __0x01__
  
  >  Prompt the user before loosing any changes (except to the ignore
     dictionary).

  __0x02__
 
  >  Delete all the dictionaries other than the ignore dictionary.

  __0x04__
  
  >  Delete the ignore dictionary.

  If the argument does not have bit 0x02 or 0x04 set, which specify the
  dictionaries to be deleted, the user is prompted for the "_dictionary_". The
  default argument is 1.


## NOTES


  The ignore dictionary is a temporary dictionary that exists in memory for
  duration of the MicroEmacs session; the dictionary holds words that have
  been ignored during any previous spell checks (see [spell(2)](spell(2))). All of the
  words that have been ignored may be discarded with:-

```{.emf}
        4 delete-dictionary

```

  i.e. __esc 4 esc x delete-dictionary__.

! 2 set-registry
## NAME


  set-registry - Modify a node value in the registry.
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __set-registry__ "_root_" "_value_"  
  _2_ __set-registry__ "_root_" "_new-name_"


## INTRODUCTION


  The _registry_ is a hierarchical tree of node names optionally with
  associated node values that is used for storing and retrieving values. The
  registry mechanism is used for saving and retrieving persistent user
  information between sessions.


## DESCRIPTION


  __set-registry__ adds a new value or modifies an existing value in the
  registry. _root_ is an absolute path node name to the new entry. The first
  path component MUST exist or the call fails, subsequent path components (a
  '`/`' separated path) are created if they do not already exist. _value_ is the
  value to assign to the node.

  If a numeric argument of 2 is specified the _root_ is renamed to _new-name_,
  the _root_ must exist or the call fails. If the _new-name_ contains a path
  (i.e. "`new/path/name`") the registry node is moved to the new path which
  must be an existing absolute path, i.e. not relative to its current
  location.

  The value assigned to a node with __set-registry__ may be retrieved using
  [&reg(4)](&reg(4)).


## EXAMPLE


  The following call (where the registry node `/history` already exists):

```{.emf}
        set-registry "/history/foo/win32/printer" "foo-bar"

```

  constructs a registry hierarchy of the form:-

     "history" {
          "foo" {
            "win32" {
              "printer"="foo-bar";
            }
          }
     }


  The value of the registry node may be retrieved using:-

```{.emf}
        &reg "/history/foo/win32/printer"

```

  which would return the value "`foo-bar`".


## HISTORY


  The __get-registry(2)__ command was removed in January 2005 in preference to
  the [&reg(4)](&reg(4)) function, the existing get command was never used.

! 2 exchange-point-and-mark
## NAME


  exchange-point-and-mark - Exchange the cursor and marked position
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __exchange-point-and-mark__ (__C-x C-x__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __exchange-point-and-mark__ moves the cursor to the current marked position
  (see [set-mark(2)](set-mark(2))) in the current window and moves the mark to where the
  cursor was. This is very useful in finding where a mark was, or in
  returning to a position previously marked.

  The current buffer mark line and column position may be obtained from
  within a macro using the variables [$window-mark-line(5)]($window-mark-line(5)) and
  [$window-mark-col(5)]($window-mark-col(5)).

## NAME


|execute-buffer
  execute-buffer - Execute script lines from a buffer
|execute-line
  execute-line - Execute a script line from the command line
|execute-region
  execute-region - Execute marked script lines from a buffer
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __execute-buffer__ "_buffer-name_"  
  __execute-line__ ["_command-line_"]  
  __execute-region__   

## DESCRIPTION


  __execute-buffer__ executes script lines in the named buffer _buffer-name_. If
  the buffer is off screen and an error occurs during execution, the cursor
  is left on the line causing the error.

  __execute-line__ executes a in script line entered from the command line.
  Typically this is used in macros.

  __execute-region__ executes Macro commands in a marked buffer region.
  Typically this is used in macro development. Please note that all possible
  narrows, hidden regions,  are removed after execution, so show up again.
  __execute-region__ is implemented in misc.emf and was introduced in ME09 v09.12.22.

## DESCRIPTION


  __execute-file__ executes script lines from the given _file_ _n_ times in
  succession, this is the normal way to execute a MicroEmacs 2009 script.
  The command prompts for a file name, and will then search for <_file_>[.emf]
  in the search path. If the file is found then the file is loaded and the
  buffer is executed _n_ times.

## NAME


  execute-kbd-macro - Execute a keyboard macro
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __execute-kbd-macro__ (__C-x e__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __execute-kbd-macro__ executes a keyboard macro. The entire sequence of
  recorded key-strokes is repeated starting at the current point. The result
  is exactly as if you were retyping the sequence all over again. A numeric
  argument _n_ prefixing the __execute-kbd-macro__ command repeats the stored
  key-strokes _n_ times.

  Keyboard macros are recored with [start-kbd-macro(2)](start-kbd-macro(2)); recording is
  terminated with [end-kbd-macro(2)](end-kbd-macro(2)).

! 2 execute-string
## NAME


  execute-string - Execute a string as a command
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __execute-string__ "_string_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __execute-string__ executes the given _string_ _n_ times as if it is being typed.
  This is the writable format of a keyboard macro, it can be placed in any
  __emf__ file. Any characters may form the _string_ (unprintables as `\xXX`) and
  key-strokes that are bound to a command will execute that command. This
  command is used by macros to store user defined keyboard macros.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example uses keyboard strokes with __execute-string__ in a macro
  to format __nroff(1)__ text located between `.` commands:

```{.emf}
        define-macro nroff-para
            beginning-of-line
            !if &not &sequal @wc "."
                1 buffer-mode "magic"
                execute-string "\CXS^\\.\CM\CB\CM\CX\CH\CN\CM"
                -1 fill-paragraph
                execute-string "\CD\CX\CH\CN\CD\CXH\CB"
            !endif
            forward-line
        !emacro

```

  __execute-string__ has the advantage that execution is very fast as the amount
  of parsing and decoding to be performed is limited. The disadvantage is
  that you cannot quickly discern which operations are being performed !!


## NOTES


  Try to avoid using named key, such as "`up`" and "`return`", as the keyboard
  macro equivalent is not readable and is likely to change in future
  releases.

  For this reason the following special abbreviations may be used

  __\E__
  
  >  The "__escape__" key.

  __\N__
  
  >  The "__return__" key.

  __\T__
 
  >  The "__tab__" key.

  __\b__
 
  >  The backspace character (0x08).

  __\d__
  
  >  The delete character (0x7f).

  __\e__

  >  The escape character (0x1b).

  __\f__
   
  >  The form-feed character (0x0c).

  __\n__
  
  >  The carriage-return character (0x0a).

  __\r__
  
  >  The line-feed character (0x0d).

! 2 exit-emacs
## NAME


  exit-emacs - Exit MicroEmacs
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __exit-emacs__ [_exitCode_]


## DESCRIPTION


  Exit MicroEmacs back to the operating system. If no argument _n_ is given
  and there are any unwritten, changed buffers, the editor prompts the user
  to discard changes. If an argument is specified then MicroEmacs exits
  immediately.

  The numeric argument is defined as a bit-mask as follows:

  `0x01`
  
  >  Prompting the user before saving any files, writes out all changed
     buffers to the files they were read from. Saves all changed
     dictionaries, killing any running commands and exits the editor.

  `0x02`
  
  >  Writes out all changed buffers to the files they were read from, saves
     all changed dictionaries, killing any running commands and exits the
     editor. The behavior is modified by flags `8` and `16`.

  `0x04`

  >  Define the exit code _exitCode_ from MicroEmacs, the default when
     omitted is 0.

  `0x08`

  >  Discard changed buffers (except the history and registry) and delete
     any backup files associated with the edited buffer(s). This mode does
     not operate when bit `1` is set.

  `0x10`
 
  >  Discard changed buffers (except the history and registry) and create a
     auto save file(s) with the changes from unsaved buffers. This mode
     does not operate when bit `1` is set.

  `0x20`
 
  >  Forces the program exit status to be 1 (non-zero), which is
     interpreted by any parent task as an error status.

  __exit-emacs__ may be used to reproduce the behavior of
  [save-buffers-exit-emacs(2)](save-buffers-exit-emacs(2)) and [quick-exit(2)](quick-exit(2)) as follows:

 
     3 exit-emacs == save-buffers-exit-emacs
     2 exit-emacs == quick-exit


## MACRO INTERACTION


  If the macro [shut-down(3)](shut-down(3)) is defined then it is invoked by the editor when
  it is closed. A user defined shutdown action may be associated with the
  close operation. It is the callers responsibility that the macro
  terminates correctly otherwise the editor will hang.


## NOTES


  All buffers with a name starting with a '`*`' are assumed to be system
  buffers (i.e. __*scratch*__) and are not saved.

  Modes `8` and `16` may be used where the user wishes to discard edited buffers
  on exiting and does not want to confirm the exit. Dictionaries should be
  configured to auto-save in [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)).

  An emergency exit command which forces the editor to quit may be
  implemented as `0x28 exit-emacs` i.e. Force quit and exit with failed
  status. Internally this is what MicroEmacs uses to perform an emergency
  quit operation caused by signal fault etc.

## DESCRIPTION


  __expand-abbrev__ expands an abbreviation to an alternate form. The
  abbreviation must be an alpha-numeric string and the cursor must be one
  position to the right of the abbreviation (which must not be
  alpha-numeric) when this command is called. If the abbreviation is found,
  it is deleted and the alternate form is inserted leaving the cursor at the
  end of the insertion unless `\p` is used. If not found, a space is inserted.

! 2 fill-paragraph
## NAME


  fill-paragraph - Format a paragraph
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __fill-paragraph__ (__esc o__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __fill-paragraph__ this takes all the text in the current paragraph (as
  defined by surrounding blank lines, or a leading indent) and attempts to
  fill it from the left margin to the current fill column as defined by
  [$buffer-fill-col(5)]($buffer-fill-col(5)). When an argument n is supplied n paragraphs are
  filled. If _n_ is positive then MicroEmacs 2009 performs indented filling
  (i.e. indentation for a bullet mark etc). If _n_ is negative then indented
  filling is disabled. If no argument _n_ is supplied then the paragraph is
  filled and the _point_ and _mark_ positions are retained. This allows
  paragraphs to be filled, whilst in the middle of the paragraph and the
  word position is maintained.

  If __justify mode__ is enabled the variable [$buffer-fill-mode(5)]($buffer-fill-mode(5)) determines
  how the paragraph is filled (i.e. _left_, _right_, _both_ or _center_). The
  variable [$fill-eos-len(5)]($fill-eos-len(5)) determines the trailing space used after a
  period (`.`) character (the trailing characters are specified by
  [$fill-eos(5)]($fill-eos(5))), typically defined as 2.

  A set of characters defined by [$fill-bullet(5)]($fill-bullet(5)) enable bullet markers to be
  placed in the text at the beginning of the paragraph causing the left
  margin to be moved to the right of the bullet. The search depth for fill
  to locate a bullet character is defined by [$fill-bullet-len(5)]($fill-bullet-len(5)). When the
  paragraph is formatted and one of the bullet characters is encountered
  then the user is prompted as to whether the paragraph should be indented
  following the marker or not. The point of indentation is shown with a `<<<<`
  marker.

  Filling is automatically disabled on paragraphs which start with
  characters in the [$fill-ignore(5)]($fill-ignore(5)) set.

  The simple text formatting is generally used for mail messages, ASCII text
  README files etc.


## EXAMPLE


  The following examples show how the text is formatted with indented
  filling enabled and both justification enabled:-

     This  is  regular  text  that  is on the
     margin

            This is a regular  paragraph that is
            offset  from  the  margin.  Note how
            MicroEmacs 2009 retains the indent.

            * With  the  introduction  of one of
              the  special  characters,  in this
              case a  bullet,  a  format  of the
              paragraph  offsets  the text  from
              the bullet.

            1) Numbered  lists   are  the  same.
               Note that the  paragraphs are all
               separated with a blank line.

            1. Numbered  lists  ending  with   a
               period.

            label - Or labeled lists, separated
                    with a dash.

            >  '>' might be an ignore
            >  character so it skips the paragraph
            >
            >          it is up to the user to
            >   format these.

## NAME


  filter-buffer - Filter the current buffer through an O/S command
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __filter-buffer__ "_command_" (__C-x #__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __filter-buffer__ executes one given operating system command, using the 
  contents of the current buffer as input, sending the results back to the
  same buffer, replacing the original text.

  This would typically be used in conjunction with __sort(1)__, __awk(1)__ or __sed(1)__
  or __iconv(1)__ to translate the contents of the buffer.

! 2 find-file
## NAME


  find-file - Load a file
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __find-file__ "_file-name_" (__C-x C-f__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __find-file__ finds the named file _file-name_. If it is already in a buffer,
  make that buffer active in the current window, otherwise attempt to create
  a new buffer and read the file into it.

  The numeric argument _n_ is used to modify the default behavior of the
  command, where the bits are defined as follows:

  __0x01__
  
  >  If the file does not exist and this bit is not set the command fails
     at this point. If the file does not exist and this bit is set (or no
     argument is specified as the default argument is `1`) then a new empty
     buffer is created with the given file name, saving the buffer
     subsequently creates a new file.

  __0x02__
  
  >  If this bit is set the file will be loaded with [binary(2m)](binary(2m)) mode
     enabled. See help on __binary__ mode for more information on editing
     binary data files.

  __0x04__
 
  >  If this bit is set the file will be loaded with [crypt(2m)](crypt(2m)) mode
     enabled. See help on __crypt__ mode for more information on editing
     encrypted files.

  __0x08__
 
  >  If this bit is set the file will be loaded with [rbin(2m)](rbin(2m)) mode enabled.
     See help on __rbin__ mode for more information on efficient editing of
     binary data files.

  __0x10__
 
  >  If this bit is set then the file hook evaluation is not performed when
     the file is loaded (i.e. the [buffer's file hook](fileHooks(2)) is not executed).

  Text files are usually thought of as named collections of text residing on
  disk (or some other storage medium). In MicroEmacs 2009 the disk based
  versions of files come into play only when reading into or writing out
  buffers. The link between the physical file and the buffer is through the
  associated file name.

  MicroEmacs 2009 permits full file names, i.e. you can specify:

     disk:\directories\filename.extension


  or (UNIX)

     /directories/filename.extension


  If the disk and directories are not specified, the current buffers disk/
  directory is used. Several points should be noted in respect to the
  methods that MicroEmacs utilizes in the handling of files:-

  - Without explicitly saving the buffer(s) to file, all edits would be
          lost upon leaving MicroEmacs - you are asked to confirm whenever you
          are about to lose edits.

  - MicroEmacs has a mechanism for "protecting" your disk-based files
          from overwriting when it saves files. When instructed to save a
          file, it proceeds to dump the file to disk, making a backup of the
          existing file when [backup(2m)](backup(2m)) mode is enabled.

  - Auto-saving files can be performed on edited buffers by setting the
        [$auto-time(5)]($auto-time(5)) variable. The file is saved in the same place with a
          '#' appended to the file name. This can be used directly by the user
          or in the unlikely event of MicroEmacs crashing (or system crash),
          the files are automatically recovered next time it is edited.

  If you do not wish to perform any edits but merely browse the file(s), add
  the [view(2m)](view(2m)) mode to the buffer or ask for the file to be read in for
  [viewing](view-file(2)) only.


## RCS Support 


  If the file does not exist and the variable [$rcs-file(5)]($rcs-file(5)) is set then the
  existence of the RCS file is tested. If the rcs file exists then it will
  be checked out using a command-line created from the variable
  [$rcs-co-com(5)]($rcs-co-com(5)). If the check-out is successful then this file is loaded.

  This raw interface for supporting file revision control systems has been
  adapted to support SCCS and Visual Source Safe see help on variable
  __$rcs-file__ for more information and examples.


## HTTP Support 


  MicroEmacs supports http file loading, this is available by default on
  UNIX systems but must be compiled in on win32 platforms (socket libraries
  not available on all win95 machines so cannot be compiled in by default).
  When available a http file can be loaded by simply executing __find-file__ and
  giving the http file name, i.e. "`http://user:password@address:port/file`".
  Only the` http://`, `address` and `/file` components are mandatory, the rest can
  usually be omitted. e.g.:

     find-file "http://www.jasspa.com/index.html"


  See help page on [%http-proxy-addr(5)](%http-proxy-addr(5)) for information on HTTP proxy server
  support.


## FTP support 


  MicroEmacs supports ftp file loading, this is identical to http except the
  prefix `ftp://` is used as opposed to` http://`. The user name and password
  defaults to _guest_ in the absence of both these fields. If the user name is
  supplied but not the password the password will be prompted for; this can
  be useful as the password will not be stored or written to the history
  file. Connection is by default on port 21.

     find-file "ftp://<me>:<password>@members.xoom.com/jasspa/index.html"


  See also [ftp(3)](ftp(3)).

  The progress of the FTP transfer, and the FTP commands issued, may be
  viewed in the `*ftp-console*` buffer. This is popped up depending on the
  setting of the [%ftp-flags(5)](%ftp-flags(5)) variable.


## NOTES


  The base name part (i.e. not the path) of `file-name` can contain wild-card
  characters compatible with most file systems, namely:-

  __?__
 
  >  Match any character.

  __[abc]__
 
  >  Match character only if it is _a_, _b_ or _c_.

  __[a-d]__
 
  >  Match character only if it is _a_, _b_, _c_ or _d_.

  __[^abc]__
 
  >  Match character only if it is not _a_, _b_ or _c_.

  __*__
 
  >  Match any number of characters.

  If the name matches more than one file, a buffer will be created for each
  matching file. Note that these are not the same wild-card characters used
  by [regex](RegularExpressions(2)).

  For _ftp_ and _http_ then a ftp console window is opened up to show the
  progress of the transfer (when configured), this is described in [ftp(3)](ftp(3)).

! 2 find-tag
## NAME


  find-tag - Find tag, auto-load file and move to tag position
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __find-tag__ "_string_" (__esc t__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __find-tag__ finds the current or given tag (_string_) in a __tags__ file and goes
  to the given point, loading the file if necessary. The tag is either the
  current word under the cursor or a user supplied word if the cursor is not
  in a word. The buffer containing the tag is popped up in another window
  and the cursor moved to the tag in the new window.

  A __tags__ file is usually created by an external program (e.g. __ctags(1)__)
  which stores word references (or tags) and the name of the file containing
  the tag, with a search string to go to its local. It is an indexing system
  which is often used in programming.

  The argument _n_ can be used to change the default behavior of find-tag
  described above, _n_ is a bit based flag where:-

  __0x01__
 
  >  Use popup-window to display the tag in a different window (default)
     when this flag is not given the current window is used to display the
     tag.

  __0x02__
 
  >  Disable the use of the current cursor position to determine the tag.
     Instead the tag must always be supplied through "_string_".

  __0x04__
 
  >  Find the next definition of the last tag (multiple tag support). This
     feature can only be used if multiple tag support is enabled (see flag
     '__m__' of variable [%tag-option(5)](%tag-option(5))) and __find-tag__ has already been
     successfully executed. In this situation the last invocation of
     find-tag defines the current tag and executing again with an argument
     of `4` will jump to the next definition of the current tag or return the
     message "`[No more "<current>" tags]`".

  >  The next tag is typically bound to `M-C-t`.

  The __tags__ file is, by default, assumed to reside in the current directory
  of the currently viewed file. The user variable [%tag-option(5)](%tag-option(5)) may be
  specified with a value of '`r`' (recursive) and '`c`' (continue) flags, which
  ascends the directory tree from the current directory and attempts to
  locate a _recursively_ generated tags file at a higher directory level.
  Recursive tag files are generally easier to maintain where project source
  files are located in a number of project sub-directories, and enable the
  whole of the project tree to be taggable.

  Two user variables must be defined before __find-tag__ will execute, if either
  [%tag-file(5)](%tag-file(5)) or [%tag-template(5)](%tag-template(5)) are not defined the error message 
  "[tags not setup]" is signaled.


## NOTES


  A __tags__ file may be generated by MicroEmacs 2009 from the menu (Tools->XX
  Tools->Create Tags File). Alternatively a __tags__ file may be generated by
  the __ctags(1)__ utility. This is typically standard on UNIX platforms. For
  Windows and DOS platforms then the __Exuberant Ctags__ is recommended, this is
  available from:-

    ` http://darren.hiebert.com`

  A MicroEmacs 2009 compatible tags file may be generated using the command
  line "`ctags -N --format=1 ."` cataloging the current directory. To generate
  __tags__ for a directory tree then use "`ctags -NR -format=1 .`". Refer to the
  __Exuberant Ctags__ documentation for a more detailed description of the
  utility.

## NAME


  get-next-line - Find the next command line
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __get-next-line__ (__C-x `__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __get-next-line__ is typically used in conjunction with the [compile(3)](compile(3)) and
  [grep(3)](grep(3)) commands to enable the user to step through errors/locations one
  by one. The command looks for lines in the form defined by
  [add-next-line(2)](add-next-line(2)) in the order of definition. If a match is found the
  command attempts to find the next error or warning found from the current
  location (See [compile(3)](compile(3))). If the buffer was not found then the next
  buffer set is searched for, and if found then the next expression from the
  cursor is automatically located. The command fails if none of the buffers
  exist, or the end of the buffer is reached.

! 2 goto-alpha-mark
## NAME


  goto-alpha-mark - Move the cursor to a alpha marked location
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __goto-alpha-mark__ "_?_" (__C-x a__)  
  _0_ __goto-alpha-mark__


## DESCRIPTION


  __goto-alpha-mark__ prompts user for an alpha character and sets the cursor
  position to the preset location. Alpha marks are specified on a per buffer
  basis, thus the current buffer is not changed, merely the current location
  in the buffer. The alpha mark must already be defined using
  [set-alpha-mark(2)](set-alpha-mark(2)). This functionality is useful for rapidly returning back
  to locations in large files.

  __goto-alpha-mark__ with a numeric argument of zero (0) returns a string
  containing all of the alpha marks that exist in the current buffer. The
  alpha mark string is returned in [$result(5)]($result(5)), this is an empty string if
  there are no alpha marks in the buffer.

! 2 goto-line
## NAME


  goto-line - Move the cursor to specified line
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __goto-line__ (__esc g__)  
  __goto-line__ "_num_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __goto-line__ moves the cursor to the specified line in the buffer. The user
  is prompted for the new line number on the command line, which may be
  entered as a relative displacement ([`+`|`-`]_number_) from the current
  position, or as an absolute line number (_number_). If the number is
  preceded by `+` or `-` then this is treated as a relative displacement from
  the current line, otherwise it is an absolute line number.

  If a positive argument _n_ is supplied, __goto-line__ moves to this line, e.g.
  to move the cursor to line 240:

```{.emf}
        240 goto-line

```

  A special case of __goto-line__ is operative if an argument of `0` is supplied,
  argument "_num_" must also be given as above except __goto-line__ treats the
  line number or displacement as an absolute move, i.e. includes narrowed
  out sections when calculating the new position. If the new line lies
  within a narrowed out section (i.e. a section that has been hidden and is
  not visible on the screen) the narrow is automatically expanded. See
  [narrow-buffer(2)](narrow-buffer(2)) for more information on narrowing.

  Supplying a negative argument to goto-line results in an error.


## NOTES


  After successfully calling goto-line, variable [$window-line(5)]($window-line(5)) is set to
  the required line number.

!! me-id: m2cmd061
! 2 goto-matching-fence
## NAME


  goto-matching-fence - Move the cursor to specified line
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __goto-matching-fence__ (__esc C-f__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __goto-matching-fence__ moves the cursor to the opposing fence character of
  the character currently under the cursor. The set of fence characters
  include `[ ... ]`, `{ ... }`, `( ... )` and `< ... >`. i.e. if the character under
  the cursor is ``{`' then __goto-matching-fence__ moves the cursor to the
  matching closing ``}`' fence, and visa versa.

  __goto-matching-fence__ can also be used to move to a matching `' ... '` and 
  "... " fence, but, as the start and end fence is the same, bit `0x04` must be
  used to indicate whether the current fence is the open or close fence, see
  below.

  __goto-matching-fence__ can also be used to move the cursor between the start
  and end of a C/C++ `/* ... */` style comment. It can also be used to move to
  matching C/C++ `#if`, `#elif`, `#else` and `#endif` constructs, cycling through
  them in the given order.

  The numeric argument _n_ is used to modify the default behavior of the
  command, where the bits are defined as follows:

  __0x01__
 
  >  When this bit is set (the default) the terminal bell is rung if the
     matching fence cannot be found.

  __0x02__
 
  >  When this bit is set the command moves the cursor to the matching
     fence, updates the screen and pauses for [$pause-time(5)]($pause-time(5)) before moving
     the cursor back again. When omitted the cursor is simply moved to the
     matching fence.

  __0x04__
 
  >  When this bit is set the fence the cursor is current at is treated as
     the close fence so __goto-matching-fence__ moves backwards through the
     file looking for the matching open fence. When this bit is omitted the
     fence is assumed to be the open fence, this bit is only used for `'` and
     `"` type fences.

  When the [fence(2m)](fence(2m)) buffer mode is enabled the matching open fence is
  automatically displayed when the closing fence is typed. The length of
  time the matching fence is displayed for can be controlled by the
  [$pause-time(5)]($pause-time(5)) variable.

! 2 list-commands
## NAME


  list-commands - List available commands
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __list-commands__ (__C-h c__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __list-commands__ constructs a list of all known built in commands and macros
  that are currently defined by MicroEmacs 2009 and presents a list of those
  commands in the buffer "__*commands*__". Each entry is formatted as:-

       command ......................... keyCode

  Where multiple keys are bound to the same command, then each of the
  _keyCode_'s is shown.

  __list-commands__ only displays visible commands, if a numeric argument _n_ of 0
  is given then all commands are displayed, irrespective of their hidden
  status.

  __list-commands__ is similar to [describe-bindings(2)](describe-bindings(2)) except that the commands
  are presented in alphabetical order (as opposed to key binding order).


## EXAMPLE


  The following is an example of the output of __list-commands__:-

     backward-char ................. "C-b"
                                     "left"
     backward-delete-char .......... "backspace"
                                     "S-backspace"
     backward-delete-tab ........... "S-tab"
     backward-kill-word ............ "esc backspace"

                                     "C-up"
     backward-paragraph ............ "esc ["
                                     "esc p"

  _n_ __grow-window-vertically__  
  _n_ __shrink-window-vertically__  
  _n_ __resize-window-vertically__


## DESCRIPTION


  __change-window-depth__ changes the depth of the current window, if the
  numeric argument _n_ is given then the window depth is changed by _n_ lines.
  If _n_ is not specified the user is prompted for the new _depth_ and the
  window depth will be changed to this value. The command aborts if the
  requested size cannot be achieved (the window becomes too small or a
  neighbouring one does).


## NOTES


  Commands __grow-window-vertically__, __shrink-window-vertically__ and
  __resize-window-vertically__ were replaced by the new __change-window-depth__
  command in April 2002. Following are macro implementations of the old
  commands:

```{.emf}
        define-macro grow-window-vertically
            @# change-window-depth
        !emacro

        define-macro shrink-window-vertically

  __help-variable__ "_variable_" (__C-h C-v__)  
  __help-item__ "_item_" (__C-h C-i__)  


## DESCRIPTION


  The help commands provide a quick on-line help facility within MicroEmacs
  2009 without invoking a third party documentation system (e.g. a browser
  such as __Netscape(1)__ or __winhelp(1)__).

  The on-line help is assisted by a set of macros which enable key words
  within the help buffers to be located by either tagging (`esc t`) or by
  selection with the left mouse button. The tag mechanism supports command
  completion.

  __help__ provides general help on the philosophy and functionality of
  MicroEmacs 2009, if an argument _n_ of 0 is given to the command it changes
  the current buffer to the internal help buffer, typically named "*on-line help*". 
  This is a [hidden](hide(2m)) system buffer used to store all the on-line help
  and can be used for a variety of things. Note that access to this buffer
  must be via the __help__ command, not __find-buffer__ and the help command will
  also ensure the system help file is loaded first.

  __help-command__ describes the purpose of the given _command_.

  __help-variable__ Describes the purpose of the given _variable_, similar to
  __help-command__, only for variables.

  __help-item__ Describes the purpose of any given item, where item could be a
  command, variable or any aspect of MicroEmacs 2009.


## FILES


  The help files are ASCII text files located in the MicroEmacs 2009 home
  directory. The files are defined as follows:-

  `me.ehf` - Help text file.
  `hkehf.emf` - Help macros.

## DESCRIPTION


  The __osd__ command manages the On-Screen Display, menu and dialogs. The
  command takes various forms as defined by the arguments. Each of the
  argument configurations is defined as follows:-


## Main Menu-Bar Status 


  __osd__ __-1__ _flag_

  This invocation determines the state of the top main menu bar. The state
  is set by the argument _flag_ defined as:-

             1 - enable.
             0 - disable.
            -1 - disable and destroy.


## Dialog Creation and Redefinition 


  __osd__ _n_ __0__ _flags_ ["_scheme_"] ["_x-pos_" "_y-pos_"] ["_min-width_" "_min-depth_"
  "_max-wid_" "_max-dep_"] ["_default-button_"] ["_initial-item_"]
  [["title-bar-scheme"] ["Text"]] ["resize-command"] ["control-command"]
  ["init-command"]

  This invocation creates or resets the base properties of dialog _n_. The
  _flags_ argument determines the arguments and are defined as follows:

  >   __A__
 
  > >        Defines dialog as an alpha type dialog, items are added according
            to their string text value. Alpha dialogs may not have separator
            or child items.

  >   __i__
 
  > >        Used with the A flag, sets the alpha ordering to be case
            insensitive.

  >  __G__

  > >       Create a Grid dialog. Every item in the dialog is given a single
            character boarder around it. If one of the dialogs items is also
            given a 'G' flag, the boarder is drawn as a box around it,
            otherwise spaces are used.

  >  __N__

  > >       Create a Note-Book (or tabs) dialog. The dialog can only contain
            one dialog inclusion item ('I') and Note-Book pages ('P'). Pages
            added before the Inclusion item (page item number is lass than the
            inclusion page item number) will be drawn at the top of the
            note-book, those added after will be drawn at the bottom.

  >  __b__

  > >       Draw boarder, draws a boarder around the outside of the dialog.
            See also flag t (title) as flag effects the boarder.

  >  __a__

  > >       Defines the absolute start-up position of the dialog in the
            arguments x-pos and y-pos, which are the column and row positions
            respectively of the dialog from the top left-hand corner of the
            display. The arguments must be specified. e.g. the main menu is
            defined with an absolute position of (0,0). If the dialog can not
            be fully drawn on the screen at the given position it will be
            moved to a position which shows the most.

          dialog is closed.  
          The command dialog is typically used to create status messages.
          e.g. a "Busy - Please Wait" dialog box, such a dialog may be
          implemented when saving the current buffer then create the simple
          dialog and sent the control-command to [save-buffer(2)](save-buffer(2)).

## Dialog Destruction 


  __-1__ __osd__ _n_

  This invocation destructs a dialog _n_. The dialog is only destroyed if it
  is not currently being displayed.


## Dialog Item Creation and Redefinition 


  __osd__ _n_ _i_ _flags_ ["_item-scheme_"] ["_width_" "_depth_"] ["_text_"] 
  ["_argument_" "_command_"]

  This invocation type adds a new item _i_ to a dialog _n_, the operation of the
  invocation is controlled by the _flags_ as follows:-

  >  __D__

  > >       Disable item i, the item is ignored and is not rendered in the
            dialog.

  >  Note that for a non-sub-menu item type, if an argument is given with
     no command then it is assumed that the number given is the item number
     to be executed, see flag __S__ for an example.


## Dialog Execution 


  _n_ __osd__

  This invocation with a single positive numeric argument executes the _n_th
  dialog.


## Returning Command Control 


  _-4_ __osd__

  An invocation of __osd__ with an argument of -4 returns control back to the
  __osd__ from a _control-command_. Refer to the __C__ flag in the create/reset dialog
  property for information and an example.


## Current Dialog Redraw 


  _-2_ __osd__

  Calling osd with an argument of -2 forces the complete redrawing of
  current dialog and any sub-dialogs. This is very useful when the execution
  of one item may effect the appearance of another.


## Redraw All Active Dialogs 


  _-3_ __osd__

  Calling osd with an argument of -3 forces the complete redrawing of all
  currently active osd dialogs. This is better than calling [screen-update(2)](screen-update(2))
  when only the osd dialogs need updating as it suffers less from
  flickering.


## EXAMPLE


  Refer to `osd.emf`, `userstp.emf`, `search.emf`, `spell.emf` and `organize.emf` for
  examples of the OSD.


## NOTES


  In December 2004 the __d__ default item flag in dialog creation was replaced
  with two new flags, __D__ and __I__. At the same time the dialog tab order was
  changed to an automated calculation so a tab index value is no longer
  required with the item tab __t__ flag.

! 2 show-cursor
## NAME


  show-cursor - Change the visibility of the cursor
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __show-cursor__


## DESCRIPTION


  __show-cursor__ hides the cursor if a negative argument is given and restores
  it if a positive or no argument is given. Note that this is not supported
  on all platforms.

  __show-cursor__ internally performs a counting operation, if the cursor is
  hidden _m_ times then it must also be shown _m_ times before the cursor
  becomes visible again, giving no argument will restore the count ensuring
  it is visible.

! 2 narrow-buffer
## NAME


  narrow-buffer - Hide buffer lines
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __narrow-buffer__  
   n __narrow-buffer__ [_line-scheme_] ["_out-markup-line_" |
         "to-top-markup-line" "to-bottom-markup-line"] ["markup-command"]


## DESCRIPTION


  The __narrow-buffer__ command allows lines in a buffer to be hidden
  (effectively folded up) the scope of the narrow is defined by a region. A
  region is the text located between the __point__ (the current cursor position)
  and the __mark__ defined by [set-mark](set-mark(2)).

  __narrow-buffer__ supports two types of information hiding. A simple _Narrow_ or
  _Narrow_ _Out_ hides lines of the region from display and optionally inserts a
  new line, called a mark-up line. The mark-up line allows the narrow
  position to be annotated with a line scheme color and annotation text
  providing a visual representation of the narrow i.e.

     Before Narrow Out           After Narrow Out
     ________________________________________________________________

     ... buffer text ...        ... buffer text ..
     <region start>              <Optional Narrow Out line mark-up>
     .... region text ...       ... more buffer text ...
     <region end>
     ... more buffer text ...


  The second narrow form is a _Narrow To_ hides text around the region leaving
  the region displayed only. A _Narrow Out_ will optionally show a mark-up
  line at both the top and bottom of the region. The mark-up line allows the
  _Narrow_ _To_ position to be annotated in the buffer with a line scheme color
  and annotation text providing a visual representation of the narrow i.e.

     Before Narrow To            After Narrow To
     ________________________________________________________________

     ... buffer text ...        <Optional Narrow Out top mark-up>
     <region start>              <region start>
     .... region text ...       .... region text ...
     <region end>                <region end>
     ... more buffer text ...   <Optional Narrow Out bottom mark-up>


  Once a narrow has been created and information has been hidden
  __narrow-buffer__ may be used to subsequently reveal the hidden text on a line
  or complete buffer basis.

  Narrowed regions do not delete the text contained within the buffer the
  information is simply hidden. Saving the buffer using [save-buffer(2)](save-buffer(2)), by
  default, writes both the displayed and hidden information the command may
  be optionally invoked to save only the visible representation.

  While information is hidden in a narrow [copy-region(2)](copy-region(2)) and [kill-region(2)](kill-region(2))
  operate as expected. If a narrow is copied then all of the information
  that is contained within the narrow is also copied to the new location.
  Similarly killing or deleting a narrow removes all of the information that
  is contained within the narrow.

  __narrow-region__ performs the low-level information hiding and is used from
  the macro command language, the command is not generally invoked directly
  by the user. Within the macro environment the location of narrows in any
  buffer may be determined using the line variable [$line-flags(5)]($line-flags(5)). This
  variable allows the narrow state of the current line in a buffer to be
  determined. The narrow state of a buffer may be determined with
  [narrow(2m)](narrow(2m)). When a narrow is created the buffer mode [narrow(2m)](narrow(2m)) is
  automatically set, when the last narrow is removed the mode is deleted.

  The effect of __narrow-buffer__ depends on the given argument and is defined
  as follows:-

  `1`
  
  >  Removes all narrows in the current buffer (the default), it aborts if
     there are no narrows in the buffer.

  `2`
  
  >  Removes the current line's narrow, it aborts if there is no narrow at
     the current line.

  `3`

  >   Narrow to region hides all but the lines of text in the current buffer
     from the [mark](set-mark(2)) position to the current cursor position, effectively
     'narrowing' the buffer to the remaining text.

  `4`
 
  >  Narrow out region hides the lines of text in the current buffer from
     the [mark](set-mark(2)) position to the current cursor position. This is the inverse
     effect of argument __3__.

  The second form of the command takes a variable number of arguments which
  are determined by the value of _n_ when bits in the range `0x0ff0` are
  defined. These bits are interpreted as a bit-mask and determine how the
  narrow is to be visually displayed to the user. When these bits are set
  then a mark-up line is created.

  `0x0010` - _line-scheme_
  
  >  Bit `0x0010` specifies the line [hilight(2)](hilight(2)) color scheme to be used on
     the narrow line when it is an open or closed narrow. The scheme colors
     used are defined by the scheme variables `scheme.fold-open` and
     `scheme.fold-closed`.

  `0x0020` - "_out-markup-line_" | "_to-top-markup-line_" "_to-bottom-markup-line_"
  
  >  Bit `0x0020` specifies that mark-up text is used, the text mark up is
     passed into the call. The number of arguments is determined by the
     type of markup operation (_to_/_out_). The arguments are placed on the
     mark-up lines.

  `0x0040` - "_markup-command_"
  
  >  Bit `0x0040` specifies that a mark-up line is used to represent the
     narrow region. When the narrow region is created then the
     _markup-command_ macro is executed to annotate the narrowed region. The
     macro is invoked when the narrow is created and is passed a numeric
     argument _n_ which identifies the operation of the narrow. The numeric
     argument to the mark-up macro is defined below, generally a positive
     argument means that a narrow is being added and negative means that
     the narrow is being removed.

  >  `1` - This is a _Narrow Out_ line.  
     `2` - This is the top of a _Narrow To_.  
     `3` - This is the bottom of a _Narrow To_.

  >  When the macro is executed then the current line is the start of the
     narrow region, the text of the line is available to the macro via
     [@wl(4)](@wl(4)). The markup-command aborts, using [!abort(4)](!abort(4)) if the mark-up line
     is to be removed, otherwise returns a mark-up line in the variable
     [$result(5)]($result(5)).


## EXAMPLE


  For example, if the buffer contains the following text:

     1 Richmond
     2 Lafayette
     3 Bloomington
     4 Indianapolis
     5 Gary
     6


  If the mark is on line 2 and the current point is on line 4, executing:-

```{.emf}
        4 narrow-buffer

```

  Creates one narrow, narrowing out lines 2 and 3, line 4 becomes the narrow
  anchor line. When the narrow is removed lines 2 and 3 will be inserted
  before line 4. The buffer will become:-

     1 Richmond
     4 Indianapolis
     5 Gary


  If instead the following command was executed:-

```{.emf}
        3 narrow-buffer

```

  Two narrows are created, the first narrowing out lines 4 and 5 (line 6,
  the last line, being the anchor line) the second narrowing out line 1
  (line 2 being the anchor line). The buffer will become:-

     2 Lafayette
     3 Bloomington
     6


  Executing __narrow-buffer__ with an argument of __2__ will only work on the anchor
  lines, namely 4 in the first example and 2 and 6 in the second.


## Marking Up 


  A pseudo line may be created by __narrow-buffer__ which is hilighted and
  annotated to show that a narrow exists. This markup is used in the
  language templates in the collapse operations (`collapse.emf`) to show that
  a narrow exists. The narrow region is applied using the __narrow-buffer__
  command as follows:-

```{.emf}
        0x34 narrow-buffer .scheme.fold-close collapse-markup

```

  This defines a narrow region with a color scheme mark-up. The mark-up line
  is annotated by the macro `collapse-markup` once the narrow is created. The
  macro is defined as follows:-

```{.emf}
        0 define-macro collapse-markup
            !if &les @# 0
                ; no markup line modificaton
                !abort
            !endif
            set-variable $result &cat &trr &lef @wl 40 " ..."
        !emacro

```
 
  The `collapse-markup` macro process the numeric argument [@#(4)](MacroArguments(4)) to determine
  the mark-up type to be applied to the buffer. When the numeric argument is
  negative then [!abort(4)](!abort(4)) is called to remove the mark-up. When the numeric
  argument is positive then a mark-up line annotation is created by taking
  the first 40 characters of the line and appending "`...`" to indicate that
  this is a narrow. The original __narrow-buffer__ call included a [hilight(2)](hilight(2))
  line scheme so the resultant mark-up line will be hilighted and show the
  first 40 characters of the defined followed by an ellipsis.


## NOTES


  Alpha mark set by [set-alpha-mark(2)](set-alpha-mark(2)) in text which is subsequently narrowed
  out will automatically remove the narrow if the user returns to the mark
  using [goto-alpha-mark(2)](goto-alpha-mark(2)).

  [get-next-line(2)](get-next-line(2)) operates on the unnarrowed buffer and will remove any
  narrows hiding the 'next' line.

  When copying a region containing a narrowed region(s) with [copy-region(2)](copy-region(2))
  then the content of the narrowed region(s) is also copied. A numeric
  argument to [copy-region(2)](copy-region(2)) may be used to change the behavior to copy the
  visual representation only.


## FURTHER EXAMPLES


  [c-hash-eval(3)](c-hash-eval(3)) macro defined in cmacros.emf uses narrow-buffer to hide
  regions of source code which have been `#defined` out, improving
  readability.

  [vm(3)](vm(3)) defined in vm.emf uses narrow-buffer with appropriate arguments to
  [append-buffer(2)](append-buffer(2)) and [write-buffer(2)](write-buffer(2)) to write out only parts of the
  current buffer.

## NAME


  hilight - Manage the buffer hilighting schemes
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _0_ __hilight__ "_hil-no_" "_flags_" [ "_nol_" ] [ "_buffer-scheme_" [ "_trunc-scheme_" ] ]

  __hilight__ "_hil-no_" "_type_" "_token_" [ ["_rtoken_"] [ ( [ "close" ["rclose"] "ignore" ] ) 
    | ( ["continue"] ) | ( ["b-hil-no"] ) ] "_schemeNum_"

  __hilight__ "_hil-no_" "_0x400_" "_from-col_" "_to-col_" "_schemeNum_"  

  _-1_ __hilight__ "_hil-no_" "_type_" "_token_"  


## DESCRIPTION


  The __hilight__ command creates and manages the buffer hilighting, the process
  of creating a new hilighting scheme is best described in 
  [File Language Templates](languageTemplates(2)). 
  The command takes various forms as defined by the arguments.
  Each of the argument configurations is defined as follows:-


## Hilight Scheme Creation 


  _0_ __hilight__ "_hil-no_" "_flags_" [ "_nol_" ] [ "_buffer-scheme_" [ "_trunc-scheme_" ] ]

  With an argument of `0`, __hilight__ initializes or re-initializes the hilight
  scheme _hil-no_ (1-255). Every buffer has a hilight scheme, the default is 0
  which means no hi-lighting and only the [$global-scheme(5)]($global-scheme(5)) etc. are used.
  The hilighting scheme must be defined before use and is used to specify
  how the buffer is to be hilighted. MicroEmacs 2009 supports the following
  hilighting concepts:-

  - __hilight string__, a user specified string is hilighted in any color
        scheme.
  - __Tokens__, same as a hilight string except that the string must be
        enclosed in non alpha-numeric characters.
  - __Start-of-line hilights__, the start of the hilight must be the first
        non-white character of the line.
  - __End-of-Line hilights__, the hilight starts from the current position
        and continues until the end of the line. Optionally, the hilight may
        continue onto the next line if the current line ends in a given
        string. A bracket may also be searched for within the line.
  - __Bracket hilight__, hi-lights from the current position until the
        closing bracket token is found.
  - __Replace string __, allows the hilight string to be replaced with a
        different user specified string. (i.e. the displayed representation
        is different from the buffer contents)

  Terminals that cannot display color directly may still be able to take
  advantage of the hi-lighting. A terminal that has fonts (i.e. _Termcap_) can
  use them in the same way using the [add-color-scheme(2)](add-color-scheme(2)) command. The
  hi-light scheme is also used in printing (see [print-buffer(2)](print-buffer(2))). If your
  terminal cannot display color in any way, it is recommended that
  hi-lighting is disabled (except when printing) as it does take CPU time.

  The "_hil-no_" argument specifies which hi-lighting scheme is being
  initialized. Once a hilighting scheme has been initialized, hi-light
  tokens can be added to it and it can be used by setting the current
  buffer's [$buffer-hilight(5)]($buffer-hilight(5)) variable to "_hil-no_". The "_flags_" argument is
  a bit based flag setting global hi-light characteristics, 
  where:- 


  __0x01__

  > The hi-light scheme is case insensitive, i.e. the following tokens
    become equivalent:-

            house == HOUSE == hOuSe

  >  When the hilight scheme is attributed as case insensitive then the
     tokens must __all__ be specified in __lower__ case.

  __0x02__

  >  Set a hi-light look-back. During the process of determining the window
     hilighting then the hilight process has to determine whether the top
     of the window starts in a hi-light bracket or not. The look-back
     command tries looking "_nol_" lines backwards for an open bracket. If an
     open bracket is found then the top of the window is assumed to start
     with that bracket, else it is assumed that the top of the window is
     not in a bracket. For example, in `C', a comment starts with "`/*`" and
     ends with "`*/`" so if the hilight was initialized with

```{.emf}
            0 hilight 1 2 10 $global-scheme

```

  >  of the following, only the first would begin hi-lighted which is
     correct (assuming the "`/*`" is 10 or less lines away).

             /* ........         /*.........           .........
                ........           .........*/         .........
            ----------------    ---------------     --------------- top of
                ........*/         .........           .........    window


  The optional argument "_buffer-scheme_" specifies the default scheme to use
  if there is no specific hi-light, when omitted the value of
  [$global-scheme(5)]($global-scheme(5)) is used. The buffer-scheme is a reference to a set of
  foreground and background color pairs previously defined with
  [add-color-scheme(2)](add-color-scheme(2)). The last argument "trunc-scheme" is also optional and
  specifies the line truncation scheme, when omitted the value of
  [$trunc-scheme(5)]($trunc-scheme(5)) is used.

  The hi-lighting scheme required is based on the type of file being edited
  and so is usually directly related to the file extension, thus it can be
  automatically set using file hooks (see [add-file-hook(2)](add-file-hook(2))).


## Hilight Scheme Token Creation 


  __hilight__ "_hil-no_" "_type_" "_token_" [ ["_rtoken_"]
       [ ( [ "close" ["rclose"] "ignore" ] ) |
            ( ["continue" ["rcontinue"] ] ) |
            ( ["b-hil-no"] ) ]
     "_schemeNum_"  
  __hilight__ "_hil-no_" "_0x200_" "_token_"  
  __hilight__ "_hil-no_" "_0x400_" "_from-col_" "_to-col_" "_schemeNum_"  

  With the default argument of `1`, __hilight__ creates a hilight token to be used
  in hilight color scheme identified by "_hil-no_" (1-255) (see the section on
  __Hilight Scheme Creation__ for a overview of hi-lighting). The second
  argument "_type_" specifies the token type and must always be specified, it
  determines which other arguments required.

  Typically the last argument, _schemeNum_, is also required. This identifies
  the color scheme to use when hilighting the token, defining the
  foreground, background and selection color schemes. This is an index
  generated from [add-color-scheme(2)](add-color-scheme(2)). If the _schemeNum_ argument is omitted
  the default hilght color scheme is used.

  The token "__type__" is a bit based flag of which 0, 1 or more of the bits may
  be set, the effect of the bits are defined as follows:

  __0x001__

  >  The "_token_" must be surrounded by non-word characters (word characters
     are typically the alpha-numeric characters), e.g. the following
     defines "`if`" as a token:

```{.emf}
            hilight 1 1 "if" .scheme.keyword

```

  >  this hilights the 'if' in "` if `" but not in "`aifa`".

  __0x002__

  >  Color this to the end of the line, often used for comments etc. For
     example in MicroEmacs macro language a '`;`' character signifies the
     rest of the line as a comment, hilighting is defined as follows:

```{.emf}
            ; this is a comment line
            hilight 1 2 ";" .scheme.comment

```

  __0x004__

  >  This is a bracket token, the closing bracket string "_close_" and an
     ignore character "_ignore_" must also be supplied. The ignore character
     indicates that when found it should ignore the next character; this
     prevents an early end on bracket miss-match. For example, in C a '`"`'
     character can be inserted into a string by 'protecting' it with a '`\`'
     character, such as "_this is a string with a \" in it_". In this example
     the ignore character should be '_\_' so the mid string '`"`' is correctly
     ignored, as follows:

```{.emf}
            hilight 1 4 "\"" "\"" "\\" .scheme.string

```

  >  An empty value, "", effectively disables the ignore feature. If
     replacing bit `0x040` is set the replacement close bracket "_rclose_" must
     be supplied.

  __0x008__

  >  The token has a continuation string, usually used with 0x02 but cannot
     be used with token types `0x004` and `0x080`. The argument "_continue_" must
     be supplied and if the replacing bit `0x040` is set the replacement
     continue string "_rcontinue_" must also be supplied. The best example of
     its use can again be found in C; macros defined using the `#define`
     pre-processor construct may be constructed on single or multiple
     lines. The macro continues onto another line if the current line ends
     with a backslash '`\`' character, e.g.:

            #define a_single_line_macro() printf("hello world\n")

            #define a_four_lined_macro()          \
            do {                                  \
                printf("hello world\n") ;         \
            } while(0)


  >   This can be correctly hilighted with the pre-processor scheme using:

```{.emf}
            ; use to-end-of-line (2) and continuation (8), i.e. 2+8=10
            hilight 1 10 "#" "\\" .scheme.prepro

```

  __0x010__


     If this is an end of line token (`0x002`) then  
            The rest of the line is checked for any valid brackets.

     Else if this is a bracket token (`0x004`) then
            This is still searched for after an end of line token is found.

     Else
            Ignored

  >  This feature enables the searching and hilighting of specific brackets
     contained within a to-end-of-line scheme. For example, consider the
     following C code:

            #define My_Token 0x01  /* This is a multi-lined comment
                                    * describing My_Token */


  >  With the '`#`' pre-processor hilight (see bit 0x08 above) the #define
     line would all be hilighted with the pre-process scheme, the comment
     would be missed causing incorrect hilighting of the next line. Instead
     this feature may be used by both the pre-processor and comment hilight
     tokens to correctly hilight the above example:

```{.emf}
            hilight 1 26 "#" "\\" .scheme.prepro
            hilight 1 20 "/\\*" "*/" "" .scheme.comment

```

  __0x020__

  >  This token must be the first non-white character of the line.

  __0x040__

  >  The token (and closing bracket tokens) are to be replaced by the given
     replacement strings. This is often utilized when displaying formated
     text such as MicroEmacs on-line help [ehf(8)](ehf(8)) pages, the output from
     UNIX __man(1)__ etc. In MicroEmacs help pages, the start of bold text is
     delimited with the character sequence "`\C[cD`" and ends with the
     character sequence "`\C`", e.g.

            "the word \C[cDbold\C[cA is in \C[cDbold\C[cA"


  >  Obviously the hilight delimiters should not appear so the character
     sequence may be correctly drawn using a bracket token, starting with
     "`\C__`" and ending with "`\C__`", replacing both with an empty string:

```{.emf}
            hilight 1 0x44 "\C[cD" "" "\C[cA" "" "" .scheme.bold


```
  __0x080__

  >  This is a branch token. When this token is found, the token (or the
     replace string) is colored using the given color _schemeNum_ and then
     the current hilighting scheme is changed to "_b-hil-no_" (which MUST be
     defined by the time it is first used). The "_b-hil-no_" hi-light scheme
     should also contain a branch token which branches back to "_hil-no_" or
     "`0`" (which branches to [$buffer-hilight(5)]($buffer-hilight(5))). A branch does not have to
     branch back to "_hil-no_", it may branch to any other hi-light scheme.
     The branches are not stacked and there is no limit on the nesting.

  __0x100__

  >  The token must be at the start of the line.

  __0x200__

  >  This is an invalid token in its own right, which is used for
     optimizing a hi-lighting scheme.

  >  This has the second highest precedence (see __0x400__) and all other bits
     are ignored. Only the first 3 arguments are required. For example, if
     there are 11 tokens starting with "`delete-`" as with the hi-lighting of
     this buffer, then adding the token "`delete-`", while invalid in its own
     right, means that "`delete-`" is only checked for once. This also
     reduces the size of the internal hilighting tables so if the message
     "__Table full__" appears, the hilighting scheme should be reduced by
     removal of the common components.

  __0x400__

  >  This is a column hilighting token, which allows absolute columns
     within a window to be hilighted (irrespective of the contents). This
     bit takes precedence over all other bits and all other bits are
     ignored. Column highlighting is a different concept to token in that
     it requires a "_from-col_" and a "_to-col_" column positions and a line
     will be hilighted in the given scheme between these two columns.

  __0x800__

  >  The flag is used with bracket tokens (`0x04`) and indicates that the
     bracket is typically contained on a single line. This information is
     used by MicroEmacs in trying to avoid hilighting anomalies caused when
     the start and end tokens of the bracket are the same (e.g. a string's
     start and end token is '`"`'). Problems arise when the bracket starts on
     one line and closes on a later line, even with a large look-back,
     eventually the start bracket will become too far back and only the end
     bracket is found. But as this is the same as the open token it is
     mistaken for an open bracket and the strings become out of synch. This
     test can reset this if further down the file an open and close bracket
     is found on the same line. For this to have any effect, the hilighting
     scheme must use look-back (flag `0x02` of __Hilight Creation__).

  __0x1000__

  >  Flag is typically used with a branch token (`0x04`) and indicates that
     the hilight exists to the end of the line or is terminated by the new
     line (i.e. encountering the end of line will removes the branch
     hilight).

  Note that `0x004`, `0x008` and `0x080` are mutually exclusive and more than 1
  should not be set in any one hilight token, if 2 or more are set the
  effect is undefined. Other than this there is no restrictions placed on
  the types of token used, although strange combinations like `0x006` may lead
  to unexpected results -- hopefully not a core dump, but not guaranteed !

  The token and close token of brackets may contain a limited subset of
  regular expression tokens as follows:-

  __^__

  >  When specified as the first character of the token, the token must be
     at the start of the line.

  __$__

  >  The token must be at the end of the line, must be the last character.

  __\{__

  >  Indicates the start of the hilighted part of the token, only one may
     be used per token. This token use is different from regex. The __\{__
     hilight start marker must be at a fixed point from the start of the
     token, that is a wild card sequence may NOT proceed the "`\{`" token,
     i.e. "`A\{ *B`" is correct, "`A *\{B`" is incorrect as it is proceeded by
     a wild card character.

  __\}__

  >  Indicates the end of the hilighted part of the token, only one may be
     used per token. The rest of the token must be matched for it to be
     used but is not considered part of the token, i.e. hilighting
     continues on the character immediately after the "_\}_", not at the end
     of the token. Similar to the __\<__ token, the length of the rest of the
     token must be fixed. This token use is different from regex.

  __\(.\)__

  >  Groups are supported in hilighting, but they must only enclose a
     single character, closures ('*', '?' and '+') must come after the
     closure, i.e. use "\(.\)*", not "\(.*\)". Alternatives ("`\|`") are not
     supported.

  >  Groups are used to capture a single, this single character may be
     tested again within the string using the syntax `\1`..`\9` as with regular
     expressions. Where the inverse character is required then the syntax
     `\!1`..`\!9` may be used. This NOT syntax is special to highlighting and
     is not present in the regular expression general syntax.

  __.__

  >  Matches any character.

  __[...]__

  >  Matches a single buffer character to a range of characters, for
     example to hilight MicroEmacs register variables (i.e. `#g0`-`#g9`,
     `#p0`-`#p9`, `#l0`-`#l9`) the following regex string may be used:

```{.emf}
            hilight 1 1 "#[gpl][0-9]"

```
 
  >  This matches a token which starts with a '`#`', followed by a '`g`', '`p`'
     or '`l`' character and ends with a numerical digit. If the user required
     the replacement (bit 0x40) of the "`#`" to "#register" to aid
     readability, the replacement string some now needs to know whether the
     second character was a '`g`', '`p`' or '`l`' and which digit. Up to 9 groups
     ("`\(.\)`") can be use to store a store a single search character, which
     can be used later in the search string and in the replacement string
     by using the form "\`#`", where `#` is the range test number counting from
     the left, e.g. for the given example use:

```{.emf}
            hilight 1 65 "#\\([gpl]\\)\\([0-9]\\)" "#register\\1\\2"

```

  >  The content of the brackets (__[__...__]__) include a set of special short
     cuts and regular expression syntax definitions as follows:-

  >  `[abc]`
  
  > >       A list of characters.

  >  `[a-z]`
   
  > >      A range of characters.

  >  `[-.0-9]`
   
  > >      A combination of character lists and ranges.

  >  `[[:space:]]`

  > >      A white space character. See [set-char-mask(2)](set-char-mask(2)) for a full
           description on MicroEmacs character range support.

  >  `[[:digit:]]`
   
  > >      A digit, 0-9.

  >  `[[:xdigit:]]`
   
  > >       A hexadecimal digit, 0-9, a-f, A-F.

  >  `[[:lower:]]`
  
  > >      A lower case letter, by default a-z.

  >  `[[:upper:]]`
   
  > >      An upper case letter, by default A-Z.

  >  `[[:alpha:]]`
   
  > >      A lower or upper case letter.

  >  `[[:alnum:]]`
   
  > >      A lower or upper case letter or a digit.

  >  `[[:sword:]]`
    
  > >     A spell word character.

  >  __[^...]__
   
  > >     Matches all characters except the given range of characters, e.g.
         "[^[:space:]]".

  `\#`
 
  >  The same character which matched the #th group token. This
     functionality is best explained using UNIX __man(1)__ output as an
     example, to create a bold character '__X__' it produces "`X\CHX`" where `\CH`
     is a backspace character thereby overstriking the first '`X`' with
     another creating a bold character. This can be checked for and
     simulated in MicroEmacs using the following:

```{.emf}
            hilight 1 64 "\\(.\\)\CH\\1" "\\1" .scheme.bold

```

  >  The use of "`\1`" in the search string ensures that the second character
     is the same as the first. This is replace by a single character drawn
     in the bold scheme.

  `\!#`
 
  >  The inverse character that matched the #th group token, i.e. NOT `\1`.

  __?__ __+__ __*__
 
  >  Matches 0 or 1, 1 or more and 0 or more of the previous character or
     character range respectively.

  `\a \A \w \W \l \L \m \u \U \d \D \h \H \x \s \S \e \g \n \r`
  
  >  Marches (`a`)lphabetic lower, the special word characters (`w`)ord,
     (`l`)ower, (`m`)alhpanumeric, (`u`)pper, (`d`)igit, (`h`)exdigit (`x`xx) literal
     hexdecimal digit, white(`s`)pace, (`e`escape, (`n`)ewline, (`g`}bell,
     (`r`)formfeed. The uppercase letters are the inverse. 
     (see ([Regular Expressions]RegularExpressions(2))).

  Following is a list of hilighting regular expression restrictions:

  >  The number of characters to the left of a __{__ and to the right of a __}__
     token must be fixed, i.e. the '__?__', '__+__' and '__*__' tokens cannot be used
     before this token. Consider the hilighting of a C function name
     defined to be a token at the start of a line followed by 0 or more
     spaces followed by a '('. The following hilight token looks valid but
     the variable space match is incorrect as it is to the right of the __}__:

```{.emf}
            hilight 1 0 "^\\w+\\}\\s*(" .scheme.function

```

  >  Instead either the space match must be include in the function token
     hilighting (which may cause problems, particularly if printing with
     underlining) or by fixing the number of spaces as follows:

```{.emf}
            ; include the spaces in the function hilighting
            hilight 1 0 "^\\w+\\s*\\}(" .scheme.function
            ; or fix the number of spaces to 0, 1 ...
            hilight .hilight.c    0 "^\\w+\\}(" .scheme.function
            hilight .hilight.c    0 "^\\w+\}\\s(" .scheme.function

```

  >  The __+__ and __*__ tokens match the longest string and do not narrow, e.g.
     consider the hilighting of a C goto label which takes the form of an
     alpha-numerical name at the start of a line followed by a ':'
     character. The token "`^.*:`" cannot be used as `.` will also match and
     move past the ending ':', ending only at the end of the line. As no
     narrowing is performed the final '`:`' in the token will not match and
     the label will not be hilighted. Instead a character range which
     excludes a ':' character must be used, e.g. "__^[^:]*:__".

  >  A group should not be followed by a __?__ or __*__ closure, it should either
     be a fixed single character or followed by a __+__ closure (in which case
     the last matching character is stored).


  Following is a list of hilight type bit / token regex equivalents:

  __0x01__

  >  "`[^word]\{????\}[^word]`"

  __0x02__

  >  "`????.*`"

  __0x20__

  >  "`^\s*\{????`" - (note that this is strictly incorrect as the `\s*` is to
     the left of the `\{`, it is correctly handled for the ease of use).

  __0x100__

  >  "`^????`"


## Hilight Scheme Token Deletion 


  _-1_ __hilight__ "_hil-no_" "_type_" "_token_" With a negative argument __hilight__
  deletes the given "_token_" from a hi-light color scheme identified by
  "_hil-no_". The token "_type_" must also be specified to distinguish between
  normal and column token types.


## EXAMPLE


## Example 1 


  Hilighting a MicroEmacs character given in hex form, checking its validity
  (i.e. "`\x??`" where `?` is a hex digit):

```{.emf}
        hilight 1 0 "\\x[[:xdigit:]][[:xdigit:]]" .hilight.variable

```

  Hilighting a C style variable length hex number (i.e. "`0x???`"):

```{.emf}
        hilight 1 1 "0[xX][[:xdigit:]]+" .hilight.variable

```

## Example 2 


  Replacing a quoted character with just the character (i.e. `'x'` -> `x`)

```{.emf}
        hilight 1 64 "'\\(.\\)'" "\\1" %magenta

```


## Example 3 


  The following example uses the branch hilighting feature to hilight each
  window line a different color to its neighbors by cycle through 3
  different color schemes:

```{.emf}
        0 hilight .hilight.line1 0                        $global-scheme
          hilight .hilight.line1 0x80 "\\n" .hilight.line2 .scheme.no1
        0 hilight .hilight.line2 0                        .scheme.no1
          hilight .hilight.line2 0x80 "\\n" .hilight.line3 .scheme.no2
        0 hilight .hilight.line3 0                        .scheme.no2
          hilight .hilight.line3 0x80 "\\n" .hilight.line1 $global-scheme

```

## Example 4 


  Simulate the hilighting from the output of a UNIX man page (taken from
  hkman.emf):

```{.emf}
        0 hilight  .hilight.man 0                                $global-scheme
        ; ignore
        hilight .hilight.man 64 ".\CH" ""                        $global-scheme
        ; normal underline/italic
        hilight .hilight.man 64 "_\CH\\(.\\)\\}[^\CH]" "\\1"     .scheme.italic
        hilight .hilight.man 64 "\\(.\\)\CH_\\}[^\CH]" "\\1"     .scheme.italic
        ; bold - first is for nroff -man
        hilight .hilight.man 64 "\\(.\\)\CH\\1\\}[^\CH]" "\\1"   .scheme.bold
        hilight .hilight.man 64 "_\CH_\CH_\CH_\\}[^\CH]" "_"     .scheme.header
        hilight .hilight.man 64 "\\(.\\)\CH\\1\CH\\1\CH\\1\\}[^\CH]" "\\1" .scheme.header
        ; bold underline
        hilight .hilight.man 64 "_\CH_\CH_\CH_\CH_\\}[^\CH]" "_" .scheme.italic
        hilight .hilight.man 64 "_\CH\\(.\\)\CH\\1\CH\\1\CH\\1\\}[^\CH]" "\\1" .scheme.italic

```

  This replaces the complex nroff character string with a single hi-lighted
  character (if you do not believe me then try it!).


## NOTES


  MicroEmacs hilight was written with speed and flexibility in mind, as a
  result the user is assumed to know what they are doing, if not the effects
  can sometimes be fatal.

  Within MicroEmacs macro language then a single backslash "`\`" is the escape
  character of the macro pre-processor. When writing a regular expression
  search string in the macro language then search string backslashes should
  be escaped. Hence a regular expression defined as "`\x41\\x41`" searches for
  the character '`A`' ('`A`' is hexadecimal 0x41 i.e. "`\x41`") followed by a
  single hexadecimal character ("`\\x`") followed by the literal string "`41`".


## HISTORY


  The March 2005 release modified the NOT replacement pattern with "`\s!D`"
  where `D` is the numeric group identifier `1..9`.

  The token `0x1000` was undocumented before March 2005 and is now a fully
  supported hilight mode.

## NAME


|hunt-forward
  hunt-forward - Resume previous search in forward direction
|hunt-backward
  hunt-backward - Resume previous search in backward direction
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __hunt-forward__ (__C-x h__)  
  _n_ __hunt-backward__ (__C-x C-h__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __hunt-forward__ repeats the last search with the last search string in a
  forwards direction, from the current cursor position. [magic(2m)](magic(2m)) and
  [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) modes are operational.

  __hunt-backward__ repeats the last search with the last search string in a
  backwards direction, as per __hunt-forward__.

  The numeric argument _n_ is interpreted as follows:-

  __n > 0__
 
  >   The _n_th occurrence of the pattern is located.

  __n < 0__

  >  The first occurrence of the pattern is located in the next _n_ lines.


## DIAGNOSTICS


  The command returns a status of `FALSE` if no previous search string has
  been established, or if the pattern could not be located (or _n_th pattern
  where _n_ occurrences are requested). If the pattern is found within the
  given search criteria the return status is `TRUE`.

## NAME


  shell - Create a new command processor or shell
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __shell__ (__C-x c__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __shell__ creates a new command processor or shell. Upon exiting the shell,
  MicroEmacs 2009 redraws its screen and continues editing. The exceptions
  to this are as follows:

  __X-Windows__

  >  A new __xterm__ is spawned off and editing control is returned to
     MicroEmacs 2009 once the __xterm__ has initialized.

  __Microsoft Windows__

  >  A new MS-DOS shell is created and control is returned to MicroEmacs
     2009 once the DOS console window has initialized. The shell created is
     determined by the MS-DOS environment variable `COMSPEC`, this may be a
     replacement shell e.g. `4DOS`.

! 2 find-registry
## NAME


  find-registry - Index search of a registry sub-tree.


## SYNOPSIS


  __find-registry__ "_root_" _index_


## DESCRIPTION


  __find-registry__ performs an indexed search of a registry sub-tree allowing
  the caller to determine the names of the children that exist as sub-nodes
  of the specified node. _root_ defines position in the hierarchy whose
  children are to be determined. _index_ is a value from `0..n` and identifies
  the index number of the child node. The name of the child node is returned
  in [$result(5)]($result(5)) if one exists, otherwise an error status is returned.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example comes from `addrbook.emf` and shows how __find-registry__
  is used to iterate through entries in the address book. Note that
  __find-registry__ is used with [!force(4)](!force(4)) and the [$status(5)]($status(5)) of the call is
  tested to determine if the invocation succeeded.

```{.emf}
        !force find-registry "/AddressBook/Names" #l0
        !if $status
            set-variable #l1 $result
            76 insert-string "_"
            2 newline
            insert-string &spr "Section: %s" #l1
            newline
            ; Iterate through all of the entries.
            set-variable #l2 0

            !repeat
                !force #l2 ab-buffer
                !if $status
                    set-variable #l2 &add #l2 1

## NAME


  insert-file - Insert file into current buffer

## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __insert-file__ "_file-name_" [ _byte-offset_ _byte-length_ ] (__C-x C-i__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __insert-file__ inserts the named file _file-name_ _n_ times into the current
  buffer at the beginning of the current line. The buffer mark is set to the
  start of the insertion and the cursor is moved to the end. If the
  _file-name_ is a directory then a directory listing is inserted into the
  buffer.

  If the numeric argument _n_ is negative then __insert-file__ reads and inserts
  _byte-length_ bytes from the byte file offset _byte-offset_.

## NAME


  insert-macro - Insert keyboard macro into buffer
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __insert-macro__ "_command_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __insert-macro__ inserts the named _command_ into the current buffer in the
  MicroEmacs 2009 macro language, thus enables it to be saved, re-load and
  therefore re-used at a later date. This is often used in conjunction with
  [start-kbd-macro(2)](start-kbd-macro(2)), [end-kbd-macro(2)](end-kbd-macro(2)) and [name-kbd-macro(2)](name-kbd-macro(2)). The given
  _command_ must have been defined either by a keyboard macro or in MicroEmacs
  2009 macro code.


## NOTES


  The __insert-macro__ provides a good method of identifying unknown low level
  key codes. Simply record the unknown key as a macro and insert the macro
  into the scratch buffer. The low level key code appears within the string.

! 2 insert-string
## NAME


  insert-string - Insert character string into current buffer
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __insert-string__ "_string_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __insert-string__ inserts a string _n_ times into the current buffer, moving the
  cursor position.

  __insert-string__ allows text to be built in a buffer without reading it from
  a file. Some special escape characters are interpreted in the _string_, as
  follows:

     `\n` - Enters a new line
     `\t` - A tab character
     `\b` - Backspace
     `\f` - Form-feed
     `\\` - Literal backslash character '`\`'
     `\xXX` - Hexadecimal value of character ASCII value


## NOTES


  If a negative argument _n_ is given to __insert-string__ the given string is
  inserted 0-_n_ times into the buffer. The behavior is the same as if a
  positive argument is given except that if the string contains a new-line
  character (ascii char 0x0a), rather than splitting the string over
  multiple lines the character is inserted into a single line of the buffer.

  This is highly irregular and can break MicroEmacs (for example [undo(2)](undo(2))
  will fail and could lead to a crash); the feature has been added to
  support bit `0x100` of the [shell-command(2)](shell-command(2)) process spawning group of
  commands. It's use outside of this context is to be avoided.

## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __ipipe-shell-command__ "_command_" ["_buffer-name_"] ["_buffer-ipipe-command_"]
 (__esc \__)  
  _n_ __ipipe-write__ "_string_"  
  _n_ __ipipe-kill__


## PLATFORM


  UNIX - _irix_, _hpux_, _sunos_, _freebsd_, _linux_.

  Windows NT - _win32_.


## DESCRIPTION


  __ipipe-shell-command__ executes the given system command _command_, opening up
  a __*icommand*__ buffer into which the results of the command execution are
  displayed. Unlike the [pipe-shell-command(2)](pipe-shell-command(2)), the user may continue editing
  during command execution. The command may be terminated by deleting the
  buffer or issuing a __ipipe-kill__ command.

  The argument _n_ can be used to change the default behavior of
  pipe-shell-command described above, _n_ is a bit based flag where:-

  __0x01__

  >  Enables the use of the default buffer name __*icommand*__ (default). If
     this bit is clear the user must supply a buffer name _buffer-name_. The
     buffer naming allows another command to be started without effecting
     any other existing command buffer.

  __0x02__

  >  Hides the output buffer, the default action pops up a window and
     displays the output buffer in a new window.

  __0x04__

  >  Disable the use of the command-line processor to launch the program
     (MS Win32 versions only). By default the "_command_" is launched by
     executing the command:

            %COMSPEC% /c command


  >  Where `%COMSPEC%` is typically `command.com`. If this bit is set "_command_"
     is launched directly.

  __0x08__

  >  Detach the launched process from MicroEmacs (MS Win32 versions only).
     By default the command is launched as a child process of MicroEmacs
     with a new console. With this bit set the process is completely
     detached from MicroEmacs instead.

  __0x10__

  >  Disable the command name mangling (MS Win32 versions only). By default
     any '`/`' characters found in the command name (the first argument only)
     are converted to '`\`' characters to make it Windows compliant.

  __0x20__

  >  Displays the new process window (win32 versions only), by default the
     window is hidden.

  __0x40__

  >  Raw ipipe, disable text annotation at the start and end of the pipe
     output and force [wrap(2m)](wrap(2m)) mode off.

  __0x80__
  
  >  Supply a function _buffer-ipipe-command_ to be invoked when the pipe
     receives data and terminates. This is equivalent to setting the buffer
     variable [$buffer-ipipe(5)]($buffer-ipipe(5)) but allows the pipe to be set when the ipipe
     is created. Setting the _$buffer-ipipe_ on invocation allows the pipe
     exit status to be trapped properly.

  __0x100__

  >  When set the command-line to be run is the first line of buffer
     _string_, this feature can be used to overcome the default 1024
     character command-line limit. When a multiple-line command-line is
     required, a negative argument can be given to [insert-string(2)](insert-string(2)).

  __0x200__

  >  When set prevents the lines from wrapping.

  Many other macro commands (see [compile(3)](compile(3)), [grep(3)](grep(3)), etc.) use this
  command.

  __ipipe-write__ writes a string _string_ to an open ipipe, _n_ times.

  __ipipe-kill__ terminates an open ipipe and is automatically invoked when the
  ipipe buffer is deleted using [delete-buffer(2)](delete-buffer(2)) or when MicroEmacs is
  exited. The numeric argument _n_ may be used to change the signal generated,
  where _n_ takes the following values:

  __1__

  >  Sends a Terminate process signal, literally a `SIGKILL` signal on UNIX
     or a `WM_CLOSE` on Windows. This is the default signal and is typically
     bound to `C-c C-k`.

  __2__

  >  Sends an interrupt signal, writes a _Ctrl-C_ to the _<stdin>_ pipe on UNIX
     or sends _Ctrl-C_ key events on Windows. This is typically bound to C-c
     C-c.


## NOTES


  On UNIX platforms the TERM environment variable of the new process may be
  set by setting the user variable __%ipipe-term__ to the required value, e.g.:

            set-variable %ipipe-term "TERM=vt100-nam"


  Ipipe shells support a large sub-set of vt100 terminal commands, notable
  exceptions are color, font support and auto-margins. Using the terminal
  type "`vt100-nam`" disables the use of auto-margins, thereby providing
  better support.

  On platforms which do not support __ipipe-shell-command__, such as MS-DOS,
  executing __ipipe-shell-command__ automatically invokes [pipe-shell-command](pipe-shell-command(2)).
  Therefore macros may safely use ipipes without explicitly checking the
  platform type. __ipipe-shell-command__ does not run reliably on __Windows__ __3.11__
  and __Windows__ __95__; __Windows__ __NT__ does support ipipes.

  While the pipe command is running, mode [pipe(2m)](pipe(2m)) is enabled. Modes
  [lock(2m)](lock(2m)) and [wrap(2m)](wrap(2m)) effect the output behavior of an
  __ipipe-shell-command__.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example is the [xgrep(3)](xgrep(3)) command macro which utilizes the
  __ipipe-shell-command__, diverting the output to a buffer called __*grep*__.

```{.emf}
        define-macro xgrep
            !force set-variable #l0 @1
            !if &not $status
                set-variable #l0 @ml00 %xgrep-com
            !endif
            !if @?
                1 pipe-shell-command &cat %xgrep-com #l0 "*grep*" @mna
            !else
                1 ipipe-shell-command &cat %xgrep-com #l0 "*grep*" @mna
            !endif
        !emacro

```

  Note that if an argument is passed to __grep__ then it uses pipe-shell-command
  instead. This is useful if another command is using __grep__ which must finish
  before the calling command can continue, see [replace-all-string(3)](replace-all-string(3)) for an
  example.


## BUGS


  On MicroSoft Windows platforms, __ipipe-shell-command__ spawns the shell (e.g.
  `command.com`) with the appropriate command line to make it execute the
  given command. If the command to be run detaches from the shell and
  creates its own window, for example `me.exe`, __ipipe-kill__ will only kill the
  shell, it will not kill the actual process, i.e. the `me.exe`.

  On MicroSoft Windows platforms __ipipe-shell-command__ does not work on
  Novell's Intranet Client v2.2 networked drives, version 2.5 does appear to
  work.

! 2 isearch-forward
! 2 isearch-backward
## NAME


|isearch-forward
  isearch-forward - Search forward incrementally (interactive)
|isearch-backward
  isearch-backward - Search backwards incrementally (interactive)
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __isearch-forward__ [ "_arg_" ] (__C-s__)  
  _n_ __isearch-backward__ [ "_arg_" ] (__C-r__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __isearch-forward__ provides an interactive search in the forward direction.
  This command is similar to [search-forward(2)](search-forward(2)), but it processes the search
  as each character of the input string is typed in. This allows the user to
  only use as many key-strokes as are needed to uniquely specify the string
  being searched. The string argument _arg_ is not supplied when invoked
  interactively.

  The follow keys can be used at the start of an incremental search only:

     `C-s` - Search for last string.
     `C-m` - Perform a search-forward instead.
     `esc p`,
     `esc n` - Scroll through history list etc (See [ml-bind-key(2)](ml-bind-key(2))).

  Several control characters are active while isearching:

  __C-s__ or __C-x __

  >  Skip to the next occurrence of the current string

  __C-r__

  >  Skip to the last occurrence of the current string

  __C-h__

  >  Back up to the last match (possibly deleting the last character on the
     search string)

  __C-w__

  >  Insert the next word into the search string.

  __C-g__

  >  Abort the search, return to start.

  __esc __or __C-m__

  >  End the search, stay here

  __isearch-backward__ is the same as __isearch-forward__, but it searches in the
  reverse direction.

  For both commands when the end of the buffer is reached, an alarm is
  raised (bell etc.) a further search request (`C-s`) causes the search to
  commence from the start of the buffer.

  The numeric argument _n_ controls the behavior of __isearch-*__ at the end of
  the buffer. When specified as `0` then the search exits when the start/end
  of the buffer is reached and the search is exhausted. When omitted (or
  specified as `1`) then the search recommences again at the start/end of the
  buffer, this is the default behavior.

  When __isearch-*__ is invoked from a macro then the string argument _arg_
  specifies the search string. __isearch__ is primarily designed for for
  interactive use and is not typically used from within a macro. When
  embedded in a macro then it is typically invoked with the `0` argument so
  that the calling macro may handle the start/end of buffer condition. The
  macro [page-file(3)](page-file(3)) uses __isearch-*__ and performs exactly this operation, for
  a comprehensive example refer to macro file `pagefile.emf`.


## NOTES


  The [ml-bind-key(2)](ml-bind-key(2)) bindings are used.

  The incremental search supports buffer modes [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) and [magic(2m)](magic(2m)).


## HISTORY


  The numeric argument to __isearch-*__ was first introduced into MicroEmacs '04.


## BUGS


  Due to the dynamic nature of active [ipipe-shell-command(2)](ipipe-shell-command(2)) buffers the
  search history cannot be stored in the same way (list of fixed locations).
  As a result the search history is stored as a list of searches which are
  not guaranteed to be consistent.

! 2 kbd-macro-query
## NAME


  kbd-macro-query - Query termination of keyboard macro
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _[Definition]_  
  __kbd-macro-query__ (__C-x q__)  

  _[Execution]_  
  __kbd-macro-query__ "__y__"|"__n__"|"__C-g__"


## DESCRIPTION


  __kbd-macro-query__ queries the termination state of keyboard macro recording.
  If the command is executed during a keyboard macro definition, at that
  point during its execution the user is prompted as to whether to continue
  the macro execution. A reply of "__y__" continues the execution as normal, "__n__"
  stops execution at that point once, if executing the macro _n_ times the
  macro will still executed a further _n-1_ times. If the "`C-g`" abort command
  is entered then all keyboard macro execution is aborted, regardless of the
  number of repetitions.

! 2 kill-paragraph
## NAME


  kill-paragraph - Delete a paragraph
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __kill-paragraph__


## DESCRIPTION


  __kill-paragraph__ deletes the next _n_ paragraphs from the current cursor
  position, the paragraphs that are killed are added to the kill buffer. If
  the cursor is in the middle of a paragraph then the text from the current
  cursor position to the end (or start, depending on direction) of the
  paragraph is deleted.

  If _n_ is positive then the kill direction is forwards, if _n_ is negative
  then the kill direction is backwards. If _n_ is `0` (zero) the command simply
  returns. The default value for _n_ is `+1`.


## DIAGNOSTICS


  The following errors can be generated, in each case the command returns a
  FALSE status:

  __[end of buffer]__

  >  The positive argument _n_ is greater than the number of remaining
     paragraphs, all of the remaining paragraphs to the end of the buffer
     are still removed.

  __[top of buffer]__

  >  The negative argument _n_ is greater than the number of previous
     paragraphs, all of the previous paragraphs to the top of the buffer
     are still removed.


## NOTES


  A paragraph is terminated by a blank line. All text residing between two
  blank lines is considered to be a paragraph - regardless of the text
  layout.


## HISTORY


  The behavior of __kill-paragraph__ was modified in November 2004 after which
  the numeric argument _n_ was interpreted to control the number and direction
  of paragraphs to delete. Previous releases interpreted a negative value as
  a control to disable the deleted text from entering the kill buffer. If
  the existing behavior is required then [kill-region(2)](kill-region(2)) with a negative
  argument should be used to delete a region of marked text,
  [forward-paragraph(2)](forward-paragraph(2)) and [backward-paragraph(2)](backward-paragraph(2)) may be used to move to the
  appropriate kill position.

!! me-id: m2cmd081
! 2 kill-region
## NAME


  kill-region - Delete all characters in the marked region
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __kill-region__ (__C-w__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __kill-region__ deletes all characters from the cursor to the mark set with
  the [set-mark(2)](set-mark(2)) command. The characters removed are copied into the kill
  buffer and may be extracted using [yank(2)](yank(2)). If a numeric argument of `0` is
  given the command has no effect. If a negative argument is given the
  characters are not placed in the kill buffer, therefore the text is
  effectively lost (this does not effect the [undo(2)](undo(2)) operation).

  The mark position may be ahead or behind the current cursor position.

  Where the region contains a narrowed region, defined by [narrow-buffer(2)](narrow-buffer(2)),
  then __kill-region__ deletes all text contained within the narrow, this text
  is added to the kill buffer.


## USAGE


  To move text from one place to another:

  - Move to the beginning of the text you want to move.
  - Set the mark there with the [set-mark](set-mark(2)) (__esc space__) command.
  - Move the point (cursor) to the end of the text.
  - Use the __kill-region__ command to delete the region you just defined.
        The text will be saved in the kill buffer.
  - Move the point to the place you want the text to appear.
  - Use the [yank](yank(2)) (__C-y__) command to copy the text from the kill buffer to
        the current point.

  Repeat the last two steps to insert further copies of the same text.


## NOTES


  If a region is accidentally removed then [yank](yank(2)) the text back immediately or
  use [undo(2)](undo(2)).

  Windowing systems such as X-Windows and Microsoft Windows utilize a global
  windowing kill buffer allowing data to be moved between windowing
  applications (_cut buffer_ and _clipboard_, respectively). Within these
  environments MicroEmacs 2009 automatically interacts with the windowing
  systems kill buffer, the last MicroEmacs 2009 __kill-region__ entry is
  immediately available for a paste operation into another windowing
  application.

! 2 kill-line
## NAME


  kill-line - Delete all characters to the end of the line
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __kill-line__ (__C-k__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __kill-line__, when used with no argument _n_, deletes all text from the cursor
  to the end of a line, the end of line character is NOT deleted. The
  deleted text is placed in the kill buffer, see [yank(2)](yank(2)) for more
  information on the kill buffer. If the line is blank then the whole line
  is deleted, including the end of line character.

  If a positive argument _n_ is supplied the specified number of lines are
  deleted. If a negative argument is specified the previous -_n_ lines are
  deleted. If _n_ is `0` the command has no effect.


## NOTES


  If a line is accidentally removed then use [yank](yank(2)) to restore the text or use
  [undo(2)](undo(2)).

  The Emacs Key binding for kill line ((__C-k__) ) may be re-bound to affect the
  behavior of the command.

```{.emf}
        ; MicroEmacs binding. Bind to kill the end of line character
        1 global-bind-key kill-line "C-k"

        ; GNU Emacs binding. Bind to leave the end of line character
          global-bind-key kill-line "C-k"

```

## HISTORY


  The behavior of __kill-line__ was modified in November 2004. __kill-line__ now
  interprets the numeric argument _n_ in both a positive and negative
  direction. The existing implementation did not operated in a negative
  direction, the negative argument controlled the kill buffer behavior of
  the line. The kill behavior is no longer an option to __kill-line__ and the
  line(s) are always added to the kill buffer, control of the kill buffer is
  required then deletion should be performed with [kill-region(2)](kill-region(2)).

  The behavior of the end of line kill used to be controlled by a __line(2m)__
  mode, this behavior may be replicated by modification of the binding as
  described in the previous section.

! 2 list-buffers
## NAME


  list-buffers - List all buffers and show their status
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __list-buffers__ (__C-x C-b__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __list-buffers__ splits the current window and in one half brings up a list of
  all the buffers currently existing in the editor. The active modes, change
  flag, and active flag for each buffer is displayed. (The change flag is a
  __*__ character if the buffer has been changed and not written out. The active
  flag is not an __@__ if the file had been specified on the command line, but
  has not been read in yet since nothing has switched to that buffer.)

  The numerical argument _n_ is a bitwise flag which determines the
  information that is displayed by the command, it is interpreted follows:-

  `  1` - The default, when the bit is set displays visible buffers only. When
  clear displays both visible and [hidden](hide(2m)) buffers.
  
  `  2` - When set shows buffer size information, including file size, memory
  size and undo size in bytes.

  The buffer list has some special command keys associated with it which
  allow the state of the buffers to be edited from the buffer list, the
  editing allows buffers to be killed and saved to disk. The key codes are
  defined as follows:-

  __1__ - Switch to buffer

  >  Switch to that buffer and make it the only buffer.

  __2__ - Move to buffer

  >  Switch the buffer list window to that buffer.

  __D__ - delete buffer

  >  Flag buffer for deletion. A buffer scheduled for deletion is marked
     with a '__D__' in first column. The delete status is enacted by the '__X__'
     command, or may be removed with the '__U__' command.

  __S__ - save buffer

  >  Flag buffer for saving. A buffer scheduled from saving is marked with
     a '__S__' in the second column. Note that a buffer may be marked for
     saving and deletion, the save operation is performed before the
     delete.

  __U__ - unmark buffer

  >  Unmark the '__D__' and '__S__' flags on current line.

  __X__ - execute

  >  Execute all the '__D__' and '__S__' flags currently set. The __S__ave is enacted
     first.

  For all but '__X__', the buffer selected is the buffer noted on the current
  cursor line. These keys are not remappable.

## NAME


|buffer-bind-key
  buffer-bind-key - Create local key binding for current buffer
|buffer-unbind-key
  buffer-unbind-key - Remove local key binding for current buffer
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __buffer-bind-key__ "_command_" "_key_"  
  _n_ __buffer-unbind-key__ "_key_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __buffer-bind-key__ creates a key binding local to the current buffer, binding
  the command _command_ to the keyboard input _key_. This command is
  particularly useful in conjunction with file loading hooks (see
  [add-file-hook(2)](add-file-hook(2))) allowing local key bindings dependent upon the context
  of the buffer.

  The message line input is not effected by the current buffers local
  bindings.

  __buffer-unbind-key__ unbinds a user created local key binding, this command
  effects only the current buffer. If a negative argument is given to
  __buffer-unbind-key__ then all the current buffer's bindings are removed.


## NOTES


  The prefix commands cannot be rebound with this command.

  Key response time linearly increases with each local binding added.

  ml-unbind-key - Remove key binding from message line
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __ml-bind-key__ "_command_" "_key_"  
  _n_ __ml-unbind-key__ "_key_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __ml-bind-key__ creates a key binding local to the message line input buffer.
  There are several commands that can be used in message line input, each
  command is associated with a main buffer editing command and inherits all
  that commands global bindings, i.e. moving forward 1 character is
  associated with the command [forward-char(2)](forward-char(2)) and thus inherits the binding
  `C-f` (as well as any other like the right cursor key). The following is a
  list of available commands, what they do and their associated commands


## Cursor Movement 


  - move backwards 1 character, command: [backward-char](forward-char(2)) (__C-b__, __left__)
  - move forwards 1 character, command: [forward-char](forward-char(2)) (__C-f__, __right__)
  - move backwards 1 word, command: [backward-word](forward-word(2)) (__esc b__)
  - move forwards 1 word, command: [forward-word](forward-word(2)) (__esc f__)
  - move to beginning of buffer, command: [beginning-of-line](beginning-of-line(2)) (__C-a__, __home__)
  - move to the end of buffer, command: [end-of-line](beginning-of-line(2)) (__C-e__, __end__)
  - move to beginning of buffer, command: [beginning-of-buffer](beginning-of-buffer(2)) (__esc <__)
  - move to the end of buffer, command: [end-of-buffer](beginning-of-buffer(2)) (__esc >__)


## Input 


  - Quote a character, command: [quote-char](quote-char(2)) (__C-q__)
  - Yank kill buffer into message line, command: [yank](yank(2)) (__C-y__)
  - insert current buffers current line into the buffer, command:
  - [insert-newline](insert-newline(2)) (C-o)
  - insert current buffers file name into the buffer, command:
  - [insert-file-name](insert-file-name(2)) (C-x C-y)
  - insert current buffer name into the buffer, command: [insert-file-name(2)](insert-file-name(2))
  - get the previous item in the yank buffer, command: [reyank](reyank(2)) (__esc y__)


## Deletion 


  - copy marked region, command: [copy-region](copy-region(2)) (__esc w__)
  - delete marked region, command: [kill-region](kill-region(2)) (__cw__)
  - delete backward 1 character, command: [backward-delete-char](forward-delete-char(2)) (__C-h__,
        backspace)
  - delete forward 1 character, command: [forward-delete-char](forward-delete-char(2)) (__C-d__,
        delete)
  - delete forward word, command: [forward-kill-word](forward-kill-word(2)) (__esc d__)
  - delete backward word, command: [backward-kill-word](forward-kill-word(2)) (__esc backspace__)
  - kill text from current position to end of line, the text is placed
    in the kill buffer. Command: [kill-line](kill-line(2)) (C-k).
  - erase whole line, the text is placed in the kill buffer, command
  - [kill-region](kill-region(2)) (C-w). Note that in incremental searches this is used to
    add the current word to the search string.


## History 


  MicroEmacs 2009 stores the last 20 entries of each kind (command, buffer,
  file, search and general which is also saved in the history file so the
  state of the history is retained when next loaded. The following commands
  can be used to manipulate the history.

  - next history list entry (loop through history), command:
  - [forward-paragraph](forward-paragraph(2)) (esc n, C-n, down)
  - previous history list entry, command: [backward-paragraph](forward-paragraph(2)) (__esc p__, C-p, up)


## Completion 


  When entering a command, file, buffer or a mode name MicroEmacs 2009
  creates a list of possible completions the following operations can be
  performed on this list.

  - expand. This completes the given input until the first ambiguous
        character, command: a space (' ') or [tab](tab(2)) (C-i).
  - expand to the previous completion (loops through the completion
        list), command: [scroll-next-window-up](scroll-next-window-down(2)) (esc C-z)
  - expand to the next completion (loops through the completion list),
        command: [scroll-next-window-down](scroll-next-window-down(2)) (esc C-v)
  - create a listing of all completions, command: a double expansion,
        i.e. 2 spaces or [tabs](tab(2)). The first expands and the second creates the
        list.
  - page up the completion list buffer, [scroll-up](scroll-down(2)) (__C-z__, __page-up__)
  - page down the completion list buffer, [scroll-down](scroll-down(2)) (__C-v__, __page-down__)


## Miscellaneous 


  - abort input, returning failure to the input, [abort-command(2)](abort-command(2)) (__C-g__)
  - re-fresh the message line, command: [recenter](recenter(2)) (__C-l__)
  - finish input, command [newline](newline(2)) (__C-m__, __return__)
  - set mark, command: [set-mark](set-mark(2)) (__C-space__)
  - exchange point and mark, command: [exchange-point-and-mark](exchange-point-and-mark(2))
  - transpose previous character with current character, command:
  - [transpose-chars](transpose-chars(2)) (C-t)
  - capitalize the next word, command: [capitalize-word](capitalize-word(2)) (__esc c__)
  - Turn the whole of the next word to lower case letters, command:
  - [upper-case-word](capitalize-word(2)) (esc u)
  - Turn the whole of the next word to upper case letters, command:
  - [lower-case-word](capitalize-word(2)) (esc l)
  - Cursor to mouse position, command: [set-cursor-to-mouse](set-cursor-to-mouse(2)) (mouse select
          in window)
  - Empty function, command: [void](void(2))

  __ml-unbind-key__ unbinds a user created message line key binding, this
  command effects only the message line key bindings. If a negative argument
  is given to __ml-unbind-key__ then all message line bindings are removed.


## EXAMPLE


  If expansion was required on the __esc esc__ key binding then use the
  following:-

```{.emf}
        ml-bind-key tab "esc esc"

```

## NOTES


  The prefix commands cannot be rebound with this command.

  Command key response time will linearly increase with each local binding.

! 2 list-variables
## NAME


  list-variables - List defined variables
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __list-variables__ (__C-h v__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __list-variables__ pops up a window with a list of all register, buffer, user
  and global variables with their current setting. The variables are shown
  for the current buffer from which the command was invoked

  __list-variables__ provides a good alternative to [describe-variable(2)](describe-variable(2)) where
  the value of multiple variables is to be interrogated.

  The output is displayed in four sections:-

  __Register variables__

  >  The current settings of the global register variables ('__#__' prefix).

  __Buffer Variables__

  >  The current setting of the buffer variables ('__:__' prefix). This
     variables relate to the current buffer from which the command was
     invoked.

  __System Variables__

  >  The current settings of the system variables ('__$__' prefix).

  __Global Variables__

  >  The current setting of the global variables ('__%__' prefix).


## EXAMPLE


  An example output from __list-variables__ is shown below:-

     Register variables:

            #g0 ........................... "29"
            #g1 ........................... ""
            #g2 ........................... "ERROR"

## NAME


|scroll-down
  scroll-down - Move the window down (scrolling)
|scroll-up
  scroll-up - Move the window up (scrolling)
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __scroll-down__ (__C-n__)  
  _n_ __scroll-up__ (__C-p__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __scroll-down__ moves the window in the current buffer down by _n_ lines, the
  default when _n_ is omitted is 1 windows worth of lines i.e. a next page
  operation. A negative value of _n_ causes the window to move up.

  __scroll-up__ moves the window in the current buffer up by _n_ lines, default
  when _n_ is omitted is 1 windows worth of lines, i.e. a previous page
  operation. A negative value of _n_ causes the window to move down.

! 2 change-buffer-name
## NAME


  change-buffer-name - Change name of current buffer
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __change-buffer-name__ "_buffer-name_" (__esc C-n__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __change-buffer-name__ changes the name of the current buffer to _buffer-name_.
  Buffer names must be unique as they act as the identity handle. By default
  the buffer name is derived from the buffer's file name excluding the path.
  This can lead to conflicts, when editing files with the same name and
  different paths, in which case a counter is appended to the end of the
  buffer name to make the name unique. For example:

     File Name               Buffer Name

     /etc/file.c             file.c
     /tmp/file.c             file.c<1>


  The numeric argument _n_ is a bit-mask and is interpreted as follows:

 `0x01`
 
  >  By default, or an argument is specified with bit 1 set,
     __change-buffer-name__ fails if a buffer with the given name already
     exists. This behavior can be changed by specifying an argument with
     the first bit cleared, e.g. 0, in which case if a buffer with that
     name already exists then a counter as appended.

  `0x02`
  
  >  Forces the buffer to adopt the given name _buffer-name_, changing the
     name of any existing buffer if required.

## SYNOPSIS


  __name-kbd-macro__ "_command_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __name-kbd-macro__ labels the last defined keyboard macro with the given
  _command_ name. The command name must be either unique or the name of an
  existing macro. A keyboard macro is deleted when another keyboard macro is
  defined, but when named, it is preserved. A named keyboard macro can also
  be bound to its own command key sequence, and may be inserted into a
  buffer enabling it to be saved and thus re-loaded and re-used at a later
  date.

  __newline__ inserts _n_ new lines into the text, move the cursor down to the
  beginning of the next physical line, carrying any text that was after it
  with it. The next line may automatically be indented depending on the
  current buffer mode, see [indent(2m)](indent(2m)), and [wrap(2m)](wrap(2m)).

## NAME


|next-buffer
  next-buffer - Switch to the next buffer
|find-buffer
  find-buffer - Switch to the next buffer
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __next-buffer__ (__C-x x__)  
  _n_ __find-buffer__ "_buffer-name_" (__C-x b__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __next-buffer__ switches to the _n_th next buffer in the buffer list in the
  current window, the default _n_ is `1`, if _n_ is negative then the `0-`_n_th
  previous buffer is selected. If `0` or a number greater than the number of
  buffers is specified then the command fails.

  __find-buffer__ switches to buffer "_buffer-name_" in the current window. If the
  buffer does not exist and a zero argument _n_ is supplied then the command
  fails. If the buffer does not exist but no argument or a positive argument
  _n_ is specified then a new buffer is created, at which point the file-hook
  is evaluated.

  If a negative argument _n_ is given to __find-buffer__ then the buffer will be
  hidden. Any window displaying "_buffer-name_" will find another buffer to
  display. This functionality is often used with the [hide(2m)](hide(2m)) buffer mode.
  If a value of -1 is given then the buffer will not be hidden in a window
  whose [$window-flags(5)]($window-flags(5)) are set to lock the buffer to the window. If a
  value of less than -1 is given then the buffer is hidden from all windows.

  The numeric argument of __find-buffer__ is treated as a bit mask as follows:

  `0x01`

  >  Bit set then the buffer is created if it does not exist. Bit clear
     then the command fails if the buffer does not exist.

  `0x02`

  >  Locate the buffer whose buffer file name matches the argument
     _buffer-name_.

  `0x04`

  >  Bit set then an inactive buffer (i.e. a buffer whose contents have not
     been loaded) shall remain inactive and the buffer contents shall not
     be restored from file. This bit setting is used to allow the buffer
     variables to be interrogated without causing the file to load. Setting
     of this bit must be used with care.

  `0x08`

  >  Bit set causes the buffer to be hidden.

  `0x10`

  >  Forces the buffer to be hidden from all windows.

  `0x20`

  >  Stop the history of the outgoing buffer from being incremented.

  If the current buffer has an _$buffer-ehook_ command set then this command
  is executed before the new buffer is switched in. If the new buffer has a
  $_buffer-bhook_ command set then this command is automatically executed
  after the new buffer is switched in but before control returns to the
  user.

! 2 define-help
## NAME


  define-help - Define help information
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __define-help__ "_string_" ["_section_"]

  >  _Free form text_

  __!ehelp__


## DESCRIPTION


  __define-help__ provides a mechanism to define help information for commands
  and variables within macro files. The command allows user defined macros
  to be documented with help information that is accessible from the command
  line via the normal help commands such as [help-item(2)](help-item(2)). 

  The help information is typically embedded in the macro file with the
  macro command that it is documenting. When the macro file is loaded then
  the help information is loaded and integrated into the existing help
  database.

  _string_ is the name of the item that is being defined, _section_ defines what
  section the item belongs to. Following is a table of standard MicroEmacs
  2009 sections:

     `1 `MicroEmacs command line arguments.
     `2 `Built-in commands.
     `2m` MicroEmacs buffer modes.
     `3 `Macro commands.
     `4 `Macro language commands.
     `5 `MicroEmacs variables.
     `8 `MicroEmacs file formats.

  When _section_ is omitted is defaults to the general section which is
  usually used for the higher level help pages.

  Text following the __define-help__ line contains the help information, this is
  a free form text area that is reproduced when the help information is
  requested. The end of the text area is delimited by a __!ehelp__ construct.
  The help text is usually displayed using a special [hilighting scheme](hilight(2)) to
  control the colors and hyper-text links to other help pages. As a result
  the text may contain escape ('`^[`') key sequences, see [ehf(8)](ehf(8)) for more
  information on the format.

  Since MicroEmacs 091224b2 for the help text as well a subset of Markdown is 
  supported. See below for an example.
  
## EXAMPLE


  The following example is a define-help representation for the
  [paragraph-to-line(3)](paragraph-to-line(3)) macro.

```{.emf}
        define-help "paragraph-to-line" "3"

        ^[cENAME^[cA

             paragraph-to-line - Convert a paragraph to a single line
        $a


        ^[cESYNOPSIS^[cA

             n paragraph-to-line


        ^[cEDESCRIPTION^[cA

             paragraph-to-line  reduces  each of the  next n  paragraphs  of text to a
             single  line.  This  is  used to  prepare  a  document  to go into a word
             processor environment where end of line marks represent paragraph marks.


        ^[cENOTES^[cA

             This command is a macro defined in format.emf.

  Now the same example written in Markdown:

  
        define-help "paragraph-to-line" "3"

        ## NAME

           __paragraph-to-line__ - Convert a paragraph to a single line
        $a


        SYNOPSIS

           _n_ __paragraph-to-line__


        ## DESCRIPTION

           __paragraph-to-line__  reduces  each of the  next _n_  paragraphs  of text to a
           single  line.  This  is  used to  prepare  a  document  to go into a word
           processor environment where end of line marks represent paragraph marks.


        ## NOTES

             This command is a macro defined in `format.emf`.


        ## SEE ALSO

             [[fill-paragraph(2)]]

        !ehelp

  Please note that the header  characters  `##` must be at the  beginning of the
  line. For code blocks you just indent everything with at least 8 spaces at the
  beginning of the line. If you would like to show short fragments of MicroEmacs
  macro code you should place this code in fenced code blocks like this:
  
       ```emf
             macro code
       ```

  The backtick code fences must as well like the headers begin at the first character
  on the documentation line.

## NAME


|forward-paragraph
  forward-paragraph - Move the cursor to the next paragraph
|backward-paragraph
  backward-paragraph - Move the cursor to the previous paragraph
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __forward-paragraph__ (__esc n__)  
  _n_ __backward-paragraph__ (__esc p__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __forward-paragraph__ moves forwards _n_ paragraphs. The cursor is placed at the
  end of the _n_th paragraph at the start of the blank paragraph separation
  line. The default value of _n_ is 1, if _n_ is negative then the direction is
  backwards.

  __backward-paragraph__ similarly moves backwards _n_ paragraphs. The cursor is
  placed at the start of the blank paragraph separation line. The default
  value of _n_ is 1, if _n_ is negative then the direction is forwards.


## DIAGNOSTICS


  The following errors can be generated, in each case the command returns a
  FALSE status:

  __[end of buffer]__
 
  >  When moving forwards, the given argument _n_ was greater that the number
     of remaining paragraphs, the cursor is left at the end of the buffer.

  __[top of buffer]__
 
  >  When moving backwards, the given argument _n_ was greater than the
     number of paragraphs before the cursor, the cursor is left at the
     beginning of the buffer.


## NOTES


  - For both invocations a negative value reverses the sense of movement
        as expected.
  - A paragraph break is defined as a blank line.

## NAME


|next-window

|previous-window
  previous-window - Move the cursor to the previous window
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __next-window__ (__C-x o__)  
  _n_ __previous-window__ (__C-x p__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __next-window__ makes the next window down the current window, if the current
  window is the last one in the frame the first one is selected. The numeric
  argument _n_ can be used to modify this default behaviour, it is a bitwise
  flag where the bits are defined as follows:

  __0x01__

  >  If there is no 'next' window because this is the last then if this bit
     is set the search for the next window is allow to continue with the
     first window of the frame. As the default argument _n_ is `1` this is the
     default behaviour.

  __0x02__

  >  When this bit is set windows whose [$window-flags(5)]($window-flags(5)) are set to be
     ignored by this command are not skipped. The setting of bit `0x010` of a
     windows __$window-flags__ will make the default action of this command
     skip it which means the the command may not simply select the next
     window but the next window without this flag set. Setting this bit of
     the numeric argument will force the command to always select the next
     window.

  __0x04__

  >  When set the search for the next window starts at the first window
     instead of the current window, this can be used to find the first
     window in the current frame.

  __previous-window__ makes the next window up the current window. The numeric
  argument _n_ has the same effect on this command as for __next-window__ except
  bit __0x04__ starts the search at the last window of the frame.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example visits every window in the current frame printing
  the buffer it displays with a second pause between each one:

```{.emf}
        ; go to the first window
        !force 6 next-window
        !while $status
            1000 ml-write $buffer-bname
            ; go to the next window - fail if this is the last
            !force 2 next-window
        !done

```


## NOTES


  Both commands fail if a suitable window cannot be for, see the example on
  how this can be used.

$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __forward-word__ (__esc f__)  
  _n_ __backward-word__ (__esc b__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __forward-word__ places the cursor at the end of the _n_th word from the current
  position; the default is 1.

  __backward-word__ places the cursor at the beginning of the _n_th previous word,
  default 1.


## NOTES


  Words are distinguished by non-alphanumeric characters and need not be
  white space such as spaces and tabs.

  A character is considered to be part of a word if it is in the
  [$buffer-mask(5)]($buffer-mask(5)) character set. The default setting for $buffer-mask is
  "`luh`" which gives a word character set of the alphanumeric characters,
  i.e. `0`-`9`, `A`-`Z`, `a`-`z`, this may be changed by setting the __$buffer-mask__
  variable. The character sets (including 4 user character sets `1`-`4`) may be
  altered by using the command [set-char-mask(2)](set-char-mask(2)).

## DESCRIPTION


  __pipe-shell-command__ executes one operating system command _command_ and pipes
  the resulting output into a buffer with the name of __*command*__.

  The argument _n_ can be used to change the default behavior of
  pipe-shell-command described above, _n_ is a bit based flag where:-

  __0x01__

  >  Enables the use of the default buffer name __*command*__ (default). If
     this bit is clear the user must supply a buffer name. This enables
     another command to be started without effecting any other command
     buffer.

  __0x02__

  >  Hides the output buffer, default action pops up a window and displays
     the output buffer in the new window.

  __0x04__

  >  Disable the use of the command-line processor to launch the program
     (win32 versions only). By default the "__command__" is launched by
     executing the command:

            %COMSPEC% /c command


  >  Where `%COMSPEC%` is typically command.com. If this bit is set, the
     "__command__" is launched directly.

  __0x08__

  >  Detach the launched process from MicroEmacs (win32 versions only). By
     default the command is launched as a child process of MicroEmacs with
     a new console. With this bit set the process is completely detached
     from MicroEmacs instead.

  __0x10__

  >  Disable the command name mangling (win32 versions only). By default
     any '`/`' characters found in the command name (the first argument only)
     are converted to '`\`' characters to make it Windows compliant.

  __0x20__

  >  Displays the new process window (win32 versions only), by default the
     window is hidden.

  __0x40__

  >  Raw mode, disable text annotation at the start of the pipe output.

  __0x100__

  >  When set the command-line to be run is the first line of buffer
     _string_, this feature can be used to overcome the default 1024
     character command-line limit. When a multiple-line command-line is
     required, a negative argument can be given to [insert-string(2)](insert-string(2)).


## NOTES


  On MS-DOS and _Win32s_ the standard shell __command.com(1)__ does not support
  the piping of _stderr_ to a file. Other shells, such as __4Dos.com(1)__, do,
  using the command-line argument "`>&`". If the environment variable
  "`ME_PIPE_STDERR`" is defined (the value is not used) then MicroEmacs
  assumes that the current shell supports piping of stderr.

! 2 screen-poke
## NAME


  screen-poke - Immediate write string to the screen
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __screen-poke__ _row_ _column_ _colorScheme_ "_string_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __screen-poke__ writes a _string_ to the screen at position (_row_, _column_) using
  the given color scheme. The screen coordinates are defined with (0,0) at
  the top left of the screen.

  __screen-poke__ by-passes the conventional buffer update and writes directly
  to the screen buffer. The command has no effect on buffers already showing
  on the screen and is erased on the next screen update. The _string_ is
  clipped to the screen area hence the caller need not continually check on
  the size of the client area.

  The numeric argument _n_ is a bitwise flag which has the following meaning  
  `0x01` Don't mark the poke area for update.  
  `0x02` Don't flush poke to screen.  
  `0x04` colorScheme is an array of values, one for each letter.  
  `0xf0` colorScheme pair offset to use.  

  If the __0x01__ flag is absent then the parts of the screen over written by
  __screen-poke__ are marked and refreshed on the next __screen-update__ operation,
  thereby erasing the poked information. If the flag is present the poked
  information remains on the screen until a forced refresh is performed
  (i.e. __1 screen-update__) or the window information under the poked screen
  data is modified.

  In macros using many consecutive screen-pokes (e.g. [Patience(3)](Patience(3)) to display
  a pack of cards) most pokes use the 'No flush' flag to improve performance
  and look on some platforms.

  The use of __screen-poke__ has largely been reduced to games such as [Metris(3)](Metris(3))
  since the introduction of [osd(2)](osd(2)) to create dialogs.


## NOTES


  Some platforms do not allow all character values to be poked, illegal
  characters are replaced with a '`.`'.

! 2 popup-window
## NAME


  popup-window - Pop-up a window on the screen
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __popup-window__ "_name_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __popup-window__ manages the display of a new window on the screen. If only
  one window exists then it will be split else the current window will
  changed to one of the other existing visible windows. If the given buffer
  name "_name_" is not null ("") then the buffer is created, if it does not
  exist, and swapped in.

  The numeric argument _n_ alters the behavior of the command as follows:

  `0`

  >  When _n_ is zero is given then the command only succeeds if the given
     buffer is already being displayed in an existing window, this window
     is made current.

  `1`

  >  When _n_ is 1 and the given buffer is not visible then a window
     displaying a system buffer is chosen in preference. A system buffer is
     one who's name starts with a '`*`' character, e.g. "`*help*`". window used
     to display

  `2`

  >  When _n_ is 2 the frame containing the buffer is made current, this will
     interact with the window manager and bring MicroEmacs to the top of
     the window stack and bring it into focus. The _name_ argument is not
     required.

  `3`

  >  When _n_ is 3 then the frame position on the Desktop Window is allowed
     to be re-positioned, this is typically called after a font change or
     screen re-size operation and ensures that the MicroEmacs window is
     positioned on the screen. The _name_ argument is not required.

  `4`

  >  When _n_ is 4 then both the frame position and frame size on the Desktop
     Window is adjusted, this is the same as `3` except the frame size may
     also be adjusted to fit on the desktop. The _name_ argument is not
     required.

! 2 print-buffer
! 2 print-region
## NAME


|print-buffer
  print-buffer - Print buffer, with formatting
|print-region
  print-region - Print region, with formatting
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __print-buffer__  
  _n_ __print-region__


## DESCRIPTION


  __print-buffer__ and __print-region__ print the current buffer or region,
  respectively, using high-lighting where appropriate. The hilighting
  assigned to a buffer is defined by the variable [$buffer-hilight(5)]($buffer-hilight(5)) the
  print scheme is defined with [print-scheme(2)](print-scheme(2)), the [scheme-editor(3)](scheme-editor(3)) should
  be used to create printer schemes.

  The printing is typically configured using [print-setup(3)](print-setup(3)), which can be
  found in the main menu under __File->Printer Setup__.

  The numerical argument _n_ is generally used for macro development, it
  changes the default behaviour of these commands as follows:

  __-2__
 
  >  Configures the printer and, on win32 platforms, opens a Windows
     printing dialog box enabling the user to configure the printer, font
     and page layout. The configuration is stored in the "`/print`" registry.

  __-1__
 
  >  Configures the printer, the configuration is stored in the "`/print`"
     registry.

  __0__
 
  >  Configures the printer and, on win32 platforms, using the Windows
     printer, opens a Windows printing dialog box enabling the user to
     configure the printer, font and page layout. The required printing is
     then performed.

  __1__
 
  >  Configures the printer and performs the required printing.


## Printing Process 


  When either of these commands are executed the macro file `print.emf` is
  executed to configure the printer (in a same vain as `me.emf` is executed to
  configure MicroEmacs for general usage). After the macro file has been
  executed the "`/print`" registry must contain the information required for
  printing. Following is a list of registry entries and their use:

  __flags__ (_integer_)

  >  The setup flags, defined as a bit mask as follows:-

     `0x0f` - Destination of the printer output.
            0x00 - Buffer only.

            0x02 - To file only.
            0x03 - To file and command line.
     `0x10` - Bit set, header enabled.
     `0x20` - Bit set, footer
     `0x40` - Bit set, enable line numbers.
     `0x80` - Bit set, Enable truncated line character (typically \).

  __cols__ (_integer_)
 
  >  Number of columns per output page.

  __mtop__ (_integer_)
 
  >  The size of the top margin in character cells (i.e. where printing may
     commence).

  __mbottom__ (_integer_)
 
  >  The size of the bottom margin in character cells (i.e. where printing
     stops).

  __mleft__ (_integer_)
 
  >  The number of characters of space forming the left magin of the
     physical page.

  >  The name of the destination file.

  __strip__ (_integer_)
 
  >  If _integer_ value strip spaces from eol.

  __device__ (_string_)
 
  >  The ASCII name of the device (i.e. `/dev/lp`).

  __eof__ (_string_)
 
  >  The printer codes for the end of the file, may be the empty string if
     not reqired.

  __eol__ (_string_)
 
  >  The printer codes for the end of line character.

  __eop__ (_string_)

  >  The background colour number.

  __command-line__ (_string_)
 
  >  The command line to perform a print operation.


## Printing Under Microsoft Windows Environments 


  Printing under Microsoft Windows Environments automatically invokes a
  dialog box to assign and configure the printer page characteristics. The
  dialog box allows the printer to be selected, enables line numbering,
  headers and footers.

  The dialog allows the user to select the font size, by defining the number
  of characters that appear on a logical page, and the number of logical
  pages that appear on a physical page. Selecting the logical and physical
  page characteristics determine the size of the font. For dense pages with
  a small typeface then a point size of 6 is appropriate. For clarity, a
  larger typeface of 10 or 12 points is advised.


## NOTES


  The last printer configuration selected by the user is held in the
  registry file "`print.erf`" which is loaded into the _/print-history_ registry
  section. This feature is implemented in the macro file `print.emf`.


## BUGS


  Landscape printing under Microsoft Windows environments is temperamental.

  Font selection under Microsoft Windows environments does not always
  determine the most appropriate font size.

  The printer interface does not support native postscript generation. (In
  progress).

## NAME


  query-replace-string - Search and replace a string - with query
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __query-replace-string__ (__esc C-r__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __query-replace-string__ operates like the [replace-string(2)](replace-string(2)) command.
  replacing one string with another. However, it allows you to step through
  each string and ask you if you wish to make the replacement. The user is
  prompted for a replacement response as follows:-

  __?__
 
  >  Help - get a list of options.

  __y__ or __space__
 
  >  Make the replacement and continue on to the next string.

  __n__
 
  >  Do not make the replacement, and continue.

  __a__ or __!__
 
  >  Replace the rest of the strings without asking.

  __e__
 
  >  Edit the replacement string.

  __l__
 
  >  Last replacement, do next and stop.

  __u__
 
  >  Undo last replacement.

  __^G__
 
  >  Stop the command.

  [$result(5)]($result(5)) is set to a list giving the number of substitutions, the final
  replace mode ('a' for all, 'l' for last or 'q' for query) and the replace
  with string.

## NAME


|quick-exit
  quick-exit - Exit the editor writing changes
|save-buffers-exit-emacs
  save-buffers-exit-emacs - Exit the editor prompt user to write changes
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __quick-exit__ (__esc z__) [_exitCode_]  
  __save-buffers-exit-emacs__ (__C-x C-c__) [_exitCode_]


## DESCRIPTION


  __quick-exit__ writes out all changed buffers to the files they were read
  from, saves all changed dictionaries, killing any running commands and
  exits the editor.

  The numeric argument is defined as follows:

  `0`
  
  >   A zero numeric argument then the editor is closed down and any unsaved
     buffers are lost.

  `1`
  
  >  Prompting the user before saving any files, writes out all changed
     buffers to the files they were read from. Saves all changed
     dictionaries, killing any running commands and exits the editor.

  `2`

  >  Discard changed buffers (except the history and registry) and delete
     any backup files associated with the edited buffer(s). Only valid with
     __quick-exit__.

  __save-buffers-exit-emacs__ prompts the user before saving any files, writes
  out all changed buffers to the files they were read from. Saves all
  changed dictionaries, killing any running commands and exits the editor.


## MACRO INTERACTION


  If the macro [shut-down(3)](shut-down(3)) is defined then it is invoked by the editor when
  it is closed. A user defined shutdown action may be associated with the
  close operation. It is the callers responsibility that the macro
  terminates correctly otherwise the editor will hang.

  For macros development then the [exit-emacs(2)](exit-emacs(2)) command provides better
  control of the exit process than __quick-exit__ and __save-buffers-exit-emacs__
  and should be used instead. __save-buffers-exit-emacs__ is actually
  implemented as __3 exit-emacs__.


## NOTES


  All buffers with a name starting with a '__*__' are assumed to be system
  buffer (i.e. __*scratch*__) and are not saved.

## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __rcs-file__ (__C-x C-q__)


## DESCRIPTION


  MicroEmacs 2009 RCS support command. The action of this command depends on
  the current buffer [view(2m)](view(2m)) mode state, the argument _n_, and the existence
  of an RCS file.

  __view-mode ON; RCS file does not exist__
 
  >  Removes buffer view mode to enable the user to edit the file.

  __view-mode ON; RCS file exists__
 
  >  MicroEmacs attempts to check out the file using the command line given
     by the variable [$rcs-cou-com(5)]($rcs-cou-com(5)) (co unlock). The file is then reloaded
     and the view mode status re-evaluated.

  __view-mode OFF; RCS file does not exist__
 
  >  MicroEmacs attempts to check-in the file into RCS for the first time
     using the command-line given by the variable [$rcs-cif-com(5)]($rcs-cif-com(5)) (ci
     first). The file is then reload.

  __view-mode OFF; RCS file exists__
 
  >  MicroEmacs attempts to check-in the file into RCS using the
     command-line given by the variable [$rcs-ci-com(5)]($rcs-ci-com(5)). The file is then
     reload.

  __negative argument given__

! 2 read-file
## NAME


  read-file - Find and load file replacing current buffer
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __read-file__ "_file-name_" (__C-x C-r__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __read-file__ operates like [find-file(2)](find-file(2)), this command either finds the file
  in a buffer, or creates a new buffer and reads the file in. The command
  destroys the current buffer before the new buffer is created making this
  command ideal to use when the wrong file was entered on a [find-file(2)](find-file(2)).
  This command is also useful for re-loading files that have changed on
  disk.

  The numeric argument _n_ can be used to modify the default behaviour of the
  command, where the bits are defined as follows:

  __0x01__
 
  >  If the file does not exist and this bit is not set the command fails
     at this point. If the file does not exist and this bit is set (or no
     argument is specified as the default argument is `1`) then a new empty
     buffer is created with the given file name, saving the buffer
     subsequently creates a new file.

  __0x02__
 
  >  If this bit is set the file will be loaded with [binary(2m)](binary(2m)) mode
     enabled. See help on __binary__ mode for more information on editing
     binary data files.

  __0x04__
 
  >  If this bit is set the file will be loaded with [crypt(2m)](crypt(2m)) mode
     enabled. See help on __crypt__ mode for more information on editing
     encrypted files.

  __0x08__
 
  >  If this bit is set the file will be loaded with [rbin(2m)](rbin(2m)) mode enabled.
     See help on __rbin__ mode for more information on efficient editing of
     binary data files.

  __0x10__
 
  >  If this bit is set then the file hook evaluation is not performed when
     the file is loaded (i.e. the [buffer's file hook](fileHooks(2)) is not executed).

  __0x20__
 
  >  Disables loss of work checks, if this bit is set then the contents of
     the buffer is destroyed without any user prompts (useful in macros).

  center of the window and redraws the whole screen. If _n_ is given then
  scrolls the window so that the cursor is _n_ lines from the top if _n_ is
  positive or from the bottom if negative.

  __recenter__ is typically used to refresh the screen if it is out of date
  (i.e. needs to be redrawn).

## DESCRIPTION


  __replace-string__ replaces all occurrences of one string with another string.
  The replacement starts at the current location of the cursor and goes to
  the end of the current buffer.

  A numeric argument positive _n_ limits the number of strings replaced to _n_.
  A negative argument _n_ limits the number of lines in which the replacement
  may take place, e.g. a value of -15 restricts the replacement of the
  string to the next 15 lines from the current cursor position.

  [$result(5)]($result(5)) is set to a list giving the number of substitutions, a replace
  mode of 'a' for all and the replace with string.

! 2 set-window
! 2 goto-window
## NAME


|set-position
  set-position - Store the current position
|goto-position
  goto-position - Restore a stored position
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __set-position__ "_label_"  
  _n_ __goto-position__ "_label_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __set-position__ stores current window, buffer, cursor and mark position
  information against the given '`label`' (a single alpha-numeric character).

  __goto-position__ takes the positional information stored against the given
  '`label`' and restores the window, buffer and cursor positions from those
  previously __set__.

  A call to __set-position__ with the same label over-writes the previous stored
  information, a call to __goto-position__ does not alter the information and
  may be restored multiple times.

  The numerical argument to __set-position__ is used to define the information
  that is stored in the position item. The argument is intrepreted as a
  bitmask, flagging what information is to be stored. The bit mask is
  defined as follows:



  `0x001`
  
  >  Store the current window.

  `0x002`
  
  >  Store the current window's horizonal scroll (value of
     [$window-x-scroll(5)]($window-x-scroll(5))).

  `0x004`
  
  >  Store the current window's current line horizonal scroll (value of
     [$window-xcl-scroll(5)]($window-xcl-scroll(5))).

  `0x008`
  
  >  Store the current window's vertical scroll (value of
     [$window-y-scroll(5)]($window-y-scroll(5))).

  `0x010`
  
  >  Store the current buffer.

  `0x020`
  
  >  Store the current window's current line using an [alpha mark](set-alpha-mark(2)).

  `0x040`
  
  >  Store the current window's current line number (value of
     [$window-line(5)]($window-line(5))).

  `0x080`
  
  >  Store the current window's current column offset (value of
     [$window-col(5)]($window-col(5))).

  `0x100`
  
  >  Store the current window's mark line using an [alpha mark](set-alpha-mark(2)).

  `0x200`
  
  >  Store the current window's mark line number (value of [$window-line(5)]($window-line(5))
     when mark was set).

  `0x400`
  
  >  Store the current window's mark column offset (value of [$window-col(5)]($window-col(5))
     when mark was set).

  When _n_ is not specified, the default value is `0x0bf`, i.e. store all
  information required to return to the window, buffer and cursor position.

  The argument supplied to __goto-position__ similarly interpreted as a bitmask,
  restoring the positional information. When the numerical argument _n_ is
  omitted the same default is used when omitted on the store. On restoring a
  position, information stored during the call to __set-position__ which is not
  requested in corresponding __goto__ is ignored, similarly information
  requested in a __goto__ which was not stored in the __set__ is also ignored.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example shows the typical use of these commands:

```{.emf}
        set-position "a"
            .
            .
        goto-position "a"

```

  The following example stores the current position at the start of a macro
  sequence, if `my-command` is not successful (__$status__ equals 0) the original
  position is restored:

```{.emf}
        set-position "\x80"
        !force my-command
        !if &equ $status 0
            ; command failed, return to the original position
            goto-position "\x80"
        !endif

```

  Note '`\x80`' is interpreted as the character with the ASCII value of 0x80
  which is a non-alphanumeric character, this is permitted in macros to
  avoid using alphanumerics.

  The following example shows how the current position can be restored after
  re-reading a file:

```{.emf}
        0xce set-position
        read-file $buffer-fname @mna
        ; a numeric argument of 0xce is not
        ; required as this is the default
        goto-position

```


## NOTES


  The position item may store and restore the current line by using an alpha
  mark or the line number. The restrore strategy will determine what is
  required, as follows:-

  The main benefit from using an alpha mark is that the position is
  maintained even when the buffer is edited, for example if the position is
  stored at line 10 and a line is subsequently inserted at the top of the
  buffer, if the line number was used then it would return back to the 10th
  line which is the old 9th line whereas if an alpha mark were used it would
  correctly return to the 11th line, as expected.

  The disadvantage of using an alpha mark is that it is only associated with
  that buffer. In some cases a position may need to be restored in another
  buffer (e.g. when re-reading a buffer the original buffer may be deleted
  first), in this situation the buffer line number must be used.

  Commands __set-window__ and __goto-window__, which simple stored and returned to
  the current window, were replaced by set-position and goto-position in
  August 2000. The following macro implementations can be used as a
  replacement:

```{.emf}
        define-macro set-window
            1 set-position "\x80"
        !emacro

        define-macro goto-window
            goto-position "\x80"
        !emacro

```

! 2 reyank
## NAME


  reyank - Restore next yank buffer
$a


## SYNOPSIS


   _n_ __reyank__ (__esc y__)

 
## DESCRIPTION


  Every region killed goes onto a stack, with the most recent at the top.
  Immediately after yanking text out into the current buffer using [yank(2)](yank(2)),
  the user may __reyank__ which deletes the region just yanked and replaces it
  with _n_ insertions of the next region on the kill stack. Another call to
  reyank deletes that region and replaces it with the next in the stack etc.

  The default behavior of __reyank__ is to wrap around the kill chain in a loop
  (i.e. returns to the start of the list when the end of the kill chain is
  reached). If a negative argument _n_ is specified then __reyank__ fails when the
  end of the kill chain is reached rather than looping back to the start of
  the list.

  The last 15 kills are stored.

! 2 save-dictionary
## NAME


  save-dictionary - Save changed spelling dictionaries
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __save-dictionary__ ["_dictionary_"]

 
## DESCRIPTION


  __save-dictionary__ may be used to save one, or all changed, dictionaries back
  to disk. By default __save-dictionary__ prompts for a single dictionary, which
  is then saved. If the dictionary to be saved has been created within the
  session (rather than read from disk) the user is always prompted to save
  and enter a full dictionary file name (pathname) to save to. If the
  dictionary was not created then the user is only prompted to save if,

  - a non-zero argument is supplied
  - and the users history registry node "_/history/spell/autosave_" does
        not exist or its value is zero.

  Otherwise the dictionary is automatically saved.

  The argument _n_ may be used to control the effect of the command, _n_ is a
  bit based flag defined as follows:-

  __0x01__
  
  >  Enables prompting before saving, only used when saving all
     dictionaries.

  __0x02__
 
  >  Save all changed dictionaries.


## NOTES


  This command is called to save all dictionary changes whenever MicroEmacs
  is exited.

  The dictionary auto-save registry value can be changed via the
  [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) dialog.

! 2 save-buffer
## NAME


  save-buffer - Save contents of changed buffer to file
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __save-buffer__ (__C-x C-s__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __save-buffer__ saves the contents of the current buffer if the contents have
  been changed, writing the buffer back to the file it was read from.

  On saving the file, if [time(2m)](time(2m)) mode is enabled then the [time stamp string]($timestamp(5))
  is searched for in the file and modified if located, to reflect the
  modification date and time.

  If [backup(2m)](backup(2m)) mode is enabled then a backup copy of the file existing is
  created and the contents of the buffer are written to the file. Any
  [automatic save]($auto-time(5)) copies of the file are deleted.

  If the buffer contains a [narrow(2m)](narrow(2m)) it will automatically be removed
  before saving so that the whole buffer is saved and restored when saving
  is complete

  If [auto(2m)](auto(2m)) mode is enabled the the file is written out in the style
  indicated by modes [cr(2m)](cr(2m)), [lf(2m)](lf(2m)) and [ctrlz(2m)](ctrlz(2m)). Otherwise the file is
  written out in the style on the current platform.

  The argument _n_ can be used to change the default behavior of save-buffer
  described above, _n_ is a bit based flag where:-


  __0x01__
 
  >  Enables validity checks (default). These include check that the buffer
     has been modified, if not an error occurs. Also the time stamp of the
     file to be written is checked, if the file systems file exists and is
     newer the confirmation of writing is requested from the user. If this
     flag is not supplied then the buffer is written whenever possible and
     without any prompts to the user.

  __0x02__
 
  >  Disables the expansion of any narrows (see [narrow-buffer(2)](narrow-buffer(2))) before
     saving the buffer. That is, the buffer is saved as it appears on the
     screen and the content of any narrow regions is discarded.


## NOTES


  - [undo(2)](undo(2)) information is discarded when the file is saved.
  - Refer to [$auto-time(5)]($auto-time(5)) for a description of the file extensions used
         by MicroEmacs 2009 for backup and temporary files.
  - Buffers may also be saved via the [list-buffers(2)](list-buffers(2)) command.

! 2 search-forward
! 2 search-backward
## NAME


|search-forward
  search-forward - Search for a string in the forward direction
|search-backward
  search-backward - Search for a string in the backward direction
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __search-forward__ "_string_" (__C-x s__)  
  _n_ __search-backward__ "_string_" (__C-x r__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __search-forward__ searches for a string from the current cursor position to
  the end of the file. The string is typed on the bottom line of the screen,
  and terminated with the `<ESC>` key. Special characters can be typed in by
  preceding them with a `^Q`. A single `^Q` indicates a null string. On
  successive searches, hitting `<ESC>` alone causes the last search string to
  be reused.

  Searching is affected by [magic(2m)](magic(2m)) mode, which allows regular expression
  pattern matching, and [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) mode which makes the search case
  sensitive.

  The numeric argument _n_ is interpreted as follows:-

  __n > 0__
 
  >  The _n_th occurrence of the _string_ is located.

  __n < 0__
 
  > The first occurrence of the _string_ is located in the next _n_ lines.

  __search-forward__ does not search through text that is hidden with
  [narrow-buffer(2)](narrow-buffer(2)). Where a search through hidden regions is required then
  [narrow-search-forward(3)](narrow-search-forward(3)) should be used instead.

  __search-backward__ searches backwards in the file. In all other ways it is
  like __search-forward__.


## DIAGNOSTICS


  The command returns a status of `FALSE` if the _string_ could not be located
  (or _n_th _string_ where _n_ occurrences are requested). If the _string_ is found
  within the given search criteria the return status is `TRUE`.

! 2 global-abbrev-file
! 2 buffer-abbrev-file
## NAME


  global-abbrev-file, buffer-abbrev-file - Set abbreviation file(s).
$a


## SYNOPSIS


|global-abbrev-file
  _n_ __global-abbrev-file__ "_abbrev-file_"
|buffer-abbrev-file
  _n_ __buffer-abbrev-file__ "_abbrev-file_"
$a

## DESCRIPTION


  The abbreviation files allow the user to define a set of short-cut
  expansion text, whereby a short sequence of chararacters are associated
  with a longer text segment. When the short sequence is entered, the user
  may elect to maually expand the sequnce with the associated replacement
  text. Provision for cursor positioning may be made in the replacement
  text.

  __buffer-abbrev-file__ sets the current buffer's abbreviation file (limit of
  one abbreviation file per buffer). __buffer-abbrev-file__ does the minimal
  amount of work to increase speed at load-up. The first use of
  [expand-abbrev(2)](expand-abbrev(2)) attempts to load the abbreviation file at which point
  errors may be reported.

  An argument _n_ of zero, forces the buffer abbreviation file to be uncached,
  such that the next abbreviation that is expanded forces a re-load of the
  abbreviation file. This is typically only used when an abbreviation file
  is being constructed and tested.

  __global-abbrev-file__ assigns a global set of abbreviations accross ALL
  buffers, such that the abbreviation is available regardless of the current
  buffer type. The global abbreviation file has a lower presidence than the
  __buffer-abbrev-file__, hence the currently assigned __buffer-abbrev-file__ is
  searched before the __global-abbrev-file__.

  Similarly for __global-abbrev-file__, an argument of zero forces the global
  abbreviation file to be uncached and re-loaded on the next use.

  An abbreviation is a string which is expanded to an alternate form, e.g.

  __e.g.__ -> __for example__

  or

  __PI__ -> __3.1415926536__

  etc.

  An abbreviation file is an ordinary text file with a strict format, it is
  loaded only once at the first call to [expand-abbrev(2)](expand-abbrev(2)), from then on it
  reminds buffered. An abbreviation file has an abbreviation per line, they
  cannot use multiple lines. This is not a draw back as the expansion string
  is executed using [execute-string(2)](execute-string(2)) so any MicroEmacs 2009 command may
  also be called.

  For example the following expansion string inserts the string "`!continue`"
  and a newline:-

  >  `"!continue\r"`

  Note that '`\r`' is used instead of '`\n`' as __C-m__ is bound to [newline(2)](newline(2)) and
  not __C-j__. The expansion string can also make use of a few useful
  abbreviations:-

  >  __\p__
  
  > >      Mark the current position (expanded to "C-x C-a P")

  >  __\P__
  
  > >      Move cursor to the marked position (expanded to "C-x a P")

  See help on [execute-string(2)](execute-string(2)) for more useful abbreviations.


## EXAMPLE


  The abbreviation must be on the left hand side followed by at least 1
  space, the expansion string must then be on the same line in quotes. So
  for the given examples, the abbreviation file would be:

     |
     |e.g. "for example"
     |PI   "3.1415926536"
     |


  The following abbreviation could be used for a C _if-else_ statement.

     |
     |if "if(\p)\r{\r\r}\relse\r{\r\r}\r\P"
     |


  This is particularly useful for email address, e.g.

     |
     |JA "\"JASSPA\" <support@jasspa.com>"
     |


  The following example is MicroEmacs 2009 C-Mode abbreviation file for
  constructing C files. Remember __\p__ is where the cursor is positioned
  following the expansion.

     #i "#include <\p>\r\P"
     #d "#define "
     if "if(\p)\r{\r\r}\r\P"
     ef "else if(\p)\r{\r\r}\r\P"
     el "else\r{\r\p\r}\r\P"
     wh "while(\p)\r{\r\r}\r\P"
     sw "switch(\p)\r{\rcase :\rdefault:\r}\r\P"


## NOTES


  Abbreviation files are given the extension __.eaf__ in the MicroEmacs 2009
  home directory.

  One of the easiest ways to create more complex abbreviations is to record
  a keyboard macro, name it and then insert the resultant macro. See notes
  on commands [start-kbd-macro(2)](start-kbd-macro(2)), [name-kbd-macro(2)](name-kbd-macro(2)) and [insert-macro(2)](insert-macro(2)).

  Try to avoid using named key, such as "`up`" and "`return`", as the keyboard
  macro equivalent is not readable and is likely to change in future
  releases.

## SYNOPSIS


  __set-alpha-mark__ "_?_" (__C-x C-a__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __set-alpha-mark__ places an alpha mark at the current location in the buffer
  which can be returned to from anywhere in the buffer using the command
  [goto-alpha-mark(2)](goto-alpha-mark(2)). The user is prompted for a mark name which can be any

! 2 set-cursor-to-mouse
## NAME


  set-cursor-to-mouse - Move the cursor to the current mouse position
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __set-cursor-to-mouse__


## DESCRIPTION


  __set-cursor-to-mouse__ sets the current window and cursor position to the
  location of the mouse on it's last event (button press or release). This
  command may change the current window. If the line on which the mouse was
  located was the message line then the no action is taken, if the line was
  a window mode line the that window is made the current window but the
  cursor location within the window remains the same. This is usually used
  in user defined macros that control the functionality of the mouse.

  Invocation of this command sets the variable [$mouse-pos(5)]($mouse-pos(5)) which
  determines where the mouse is within the window. Interrogation of the
  variable following the command may be used to determine if the mouse is
  located on one of the more specialized window or screen regions.

  An argument _n_ determines if the command is permitted to change windows and
  cursor position, where the bits are defined as follows:

  __0x01__
 
  >  Permit changing of the current window, if not permitted and the mouse
     is not in the current window __set-cursor-to-mouse__ returns an error
     condition in [$mouse-pos(5)]($mouse-pos(5)).

  __0x02__
 
  >  Permit changing of the cursor position.

  The default argument when omitted is _3_, allowing the changing of both.

  When writing macros to cut and paste using the mouse, care should be taken
  to ensure that the window at the button release is the same is at the
  button press. If this is not undertaken, undesired effects could result.
  The use of [set-position(2)](set-position(2)) and [goto-position(2)](goto-position(2)) are most usefully used
  with this command to restore existing window context.

! 2 set-mark
## NAME


  set-mark - Set starting point of region
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __set-mark__ (__esc space__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __set-mark__ is used to delimit the beginning of a marked region. Many
  commands are effective for a region of text. A region is defined as the
  text between the mark and the current cursor position. To delete a section
  of text, for example, one moves the cursor to the beginning of the text to
  be deleted, issues the __set-mark__ command by typing __esc space__, moves the
  cursor to the end of the text to be deleted, and then deletes it by using
  the [kill-region(2)](kill-region(2)) (__C-w__) command.  
  Only one mark can be set in one window
  or one buffer at a time, and MicroEmacs 2009 will try to remember a mark
  set in an off screen buffer when it is called back on screen.

  A region is a block of text to be acted upon by some MicroEmacs commands.
  It is demarcated by the __POINT__ on one end and the __MARK__ at the other. The
  point is the primary location identifier where most of the action takes
  place and is always between two characters. The point is indicated by the
  cursor position in that it is just left of the cursor. The point is also
  significant in that it defines one end of the region. The mark, on the
  other hand, is invisible, and is used to demarcate the other end of the
  region and is set through __set-mark__.

  The current buffer mark line and column position may be obtained from
  within a macro using the variables [$window-mark-line(5)]($window-mark-line(5)) and
  [$window-mark-col(5)]($window-mark-col(5)).

$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __set-variable__ "_variable_" "_value_" (__C-x v__)  
  __unset-variable__ "_variable_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __set-variable__ sets the given register (__#__ name), system (__$__ name), global (__%__
  name), buffer (__:__ name) or command (__.__ name) variable to the given value,
  erasing its current value. The returned value of an undefined variable is
  the string "`ERROR`", this maybe used to determine whether a variable has
  been set.

  __unset-variable__ unsets the given variable so that it no longer exists. The
  variable must be a global (__%__), buffer (__:__) or command (__.__) variable, system
  (__$__) variables cannot be unset.

  The _value_ may be quoted or unquoted, if there are any white space
  characters, or characters open to other interpretation (e.g. __@wc__) in _value_
  then quotes should be used.

  _value_ may contain control characters which are delimited by a back slash
  (__\__) which include:-

     `\n` newline
     `\t` tab
     `\\` backslash

  Confusion sometimes arises in macros with the back slash, as the back
  slashes are dereferenced when set. Commands such as [replace-string(2)](replace-string(2))
  where the command itself utilizes back slashes. In this case the number of
  back slashes should be doubled as the variable contents under go two
  stages of dereferencing.

! 2 append-buffer
## NAME


  append-buffer - Write contents of buffer to end of named file
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __append-buffer__ "_file-name_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __append-buffer__ is used to write the contents of the current buffer into an
  EXISTING file. Use [save-buffer(2)](save-buffer(2)) if the buffer is to over-write the
  existing file already associated with the buffer. Use [write-buffer(2)](write-buffer(2)) if
  the buffer is to be written out to a new file, or to replace an existing
  file.

  __append-buffer__ writes the contents of the current buffer to the named file
  _file-name_. But unlike [write-buffer(2)](write-buffer(2)) the action of the write does not
  change the attributes associated with the file (if it exists), it also
  does not effect the stats of the current buffer.

  On writing the file, append-buffer ignores the [time(2m)](time(2m)) and [backup(2m)](backup(2m))
  mode settings. The current buffer will not be time stamped and a backup
  will not be created for "_file-name_". If the buffer contains a [narrow(2m)](narrow(2m))
  it will automatically be removed before saving so that the whole buffer is
  saved and restored when saving is complete

  The argument _n_ is a bit based flag, where:-

  __0x01__
 
  >  Enables validity checks (default). These include a check that the
     given file already exist, if not confirmation of writing is requested
     from the user. Without this flag the command will always succeed
     wherever possible. If "_file-name_" does not exist the buffer is written
     out in a similar fashion to using the command [write-buffer(2)](write-buffer(2)).

  __0x02__
 
  >  Disables the expansion of any narrows (see [narrow-buffer(2)](narrow-buffer(2))) before
     appending the buffer.

  __0x04__
 
  >  Truncate the existing file before writing out the contents of the
     buffer. This means that the file will consist solely of the contents
     of the buffer, but it will still have the file attributes of the
     original file.

  If _n_ is not specified then the default argument of 1 is used.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example appends the current buffer onto the end of a file,
  creating the file if it does not exists

```{.emf}
        append-buffer "things_to_do.txt"

```

  The following example truncates the users email file while maintaining the
  file attributes. This is taken from [vm(3)](vm(3)) where it is used to remove the
  current mail from the system mail box.

```{.emf}
     find-buffer "*vm-empty-buffer"
     -1 buffer-mode "ctrlz"
     5 append-buffer %vm-mail-src
     delete-buffer $buffer-bname
```


  Note that the macro ensures that [ctrlz(2m)](ctrlz(2m)) mode is removed. If it was
  enabled then the file written would not be empty.

## NAME


  sort-lines - Alphabetically sort lines
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __sort-lines__


## DESCRIPTION


  __sort-lines__ alphabetically sorts lines of text in the current buffer from
  the [mark](set-mark(2)) position to the current cursor position. If the buffer mode
  [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) is enabled then the sort is case sensitive, otherwise the sort
  is case insensitive. By default the text is compared from left to right
  from column 0 (the left hand edge), if a positive argument _n_ is given then
  the text is compared left to right from the _n_th column, any lines shorter
  than _n_ characters are moved to the top and sorted from column 0.

  If a negative argument _n_ is given then the text is sorted in reverse
  order. The comparison starts at column `-1-n`, i.e. an argument of -1 sorts
  in reverse order from column 0.


## EXAMPLE


  The following table gives the results of __sort-lines__ for different exact
  modes and values of _n_.

## NOTES


  Typically MicroEmacs is executed with [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) mode enabled, the macro
  command __sort-lines-ignore-case__ provides a command to sort lines case
  insensitively while __exact__ mode is enabled. The macro is defined as
  follows:-

```{.emf}
        define-macro sort-lines-ignore-case
            set-variable #l0 &bmod exact
            -1 buffer-mode "exact"
            !if @?
                @# sort-lines
            !else
                sort-lines
            !endif
            &cond #l0 1 -1 buffer-mode "exact"
        !emacro

```

  [sort-lines-ignore-case(3)](sort-lines-ignore-case(3)) is a macro defined in format.emf.

! 2 spell
## NAME


  spell - Spell checker service provider
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __spell__ ["_word_"] ["_rules_"] ["_correction_"] ["_rule_"]


## DESCRIPTION


  __spell__ is a low level command which provides spell checking capabilities
  for MicroEmacs 2009, it is not designed to be used directly. The action of
  __spell__ depends on the argument given, which is a bitwise flag defined as
  follows:-

  __0x001__
 
  >  If set then gets the input word from the user, i.e. "_word_" must be
     supplied. Otherwise the word input is taken from the current buffer.

  __0x002__
 
  >  If set then keeps getting words from the current buffer until either
     the end of the buffer is reached or an error is found. If the end of
     the buffer is reached then the command succeeds setting [$result(5)]($result(5)) to
     the value "_F_". This bit is ignored if bit 0x001 is set. __spell__ sets the
     current show-region to enclose the problematical word and the command
     [show-region(2)](show-region(2)) can be used to move around the word.

  __0x004__
 
  >  Adds the given word to a dictionary determined by the state of bit
     0x008. If the word is flagged as erroneous (see bit 0x010) then a
     "_correction_" word must be supplied, otherwise a list of "_rules_" which
     can be applied to the word must be given, this list can be empty. Note
     that if the word is not flagged as erroneous and it already exists in
     the dictionary, the word is not removed, instead a combined rule list
     is created.

  __0x008__
 
  >  When set flags that word additions (bit 0x004) and deletions (bit
     0x200) should be made to the ignore dictionary. Otherwise word
     additions are made the last added dictionary and deletions are made to
     all main dictionaries.

  __0x010__
 
  >  When set flags that the given word is erroneous, used solely by word
     additions to create auto-corrections.

  __0x020__
 
  >  Returns a '_|_' separated guess list for the given word in __$result__.

  __0x040__
 
  >  If bit __0x100__ is also set a complete list of valid words derivable from
     the given word are inserted into the current buffer. Otherwise spell
     returns [$result(5)]($result(5)) set to the derivative word created when the given
     "_rule_" is applied to "_word_". The rule applied is the first found of
     the given rule letter with a matching base ending (see
     [add-spell-rule(2)](add-spell-rule(2))). The word need not exist as not tests for the
     legality of the resultant word is used, for example in American,
     executing


         65 spell "spelling" "V"


     returns "`spellingive`" in __$result__. Returns the empty string if no rule
     could be applied.

  __0x080__
 
  >  Used with bit 0x002 to enable double word checking.

  __0x100__
 
  >  Return information in __$result__ about the given word, or the word which
     is used to derive the given word. The information consists of the
     spell status, the word as stored in the dictionary, and either the
     list of valid rules, or the correction word. See also bit __0x040__.

  __0x200__
 
  >  Delete the given word from a dictionary determined by bit 0x008

  If none of the main functions are used (bits 0x004, 0x020, 0x040 & 0x200)
  then the status flag is returned in the first column of __$result__. These are
  defined as follows:-

  __A__
 
  >  Auto-replace. The word was found and flagged as erroneous. The
     correction word is given in __$result__, either next to the flag, or if
     bit 0x100 is set then after the '_>_' character.

  __D__
 
  >  Double word. Indicates that the first problem found is a double
     occurrence of the same word one after the other.

  __E__
 
  >  Erroneous. The word was not found, so is Erroneous

  __N__
 
  >  Not a word. The current word found contains no alphabetic characters
     so is not deemed to be a word, e.g. 3.141593.

  __O__
 
  >  Okay. The word was found and is not an erroneous word.

## NAME


  next-window-find-buffer - Split the current window and show new buffer
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __next-window-find-buffer__ "_buffer_" (__C-x 3__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __next-window-find-buffer__ splits the current window into two near equal
  windows, and swaps the current windows buffer to the given _buffer_. It is
  effectively a [split-window-vertically(2)](split-window-vertically(2)) command followed by a
  [find-buffer(2)](find-buffer(2)). When there is insufficient space in the current window to
  perform the split, then the current window is replaced. The requested
  _buffer_ is always displayed, if the buffer does not already exist it is
  created.

## NAME


  next-window-find-file - Split the current window and find file
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __next-window-find-file__ "_file_" (__C-x 4__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __next-window-find-file__ splits the current window into two near equal
  windows, and loads the given _file_ into the current window. It is
  effectively a [split-window-vertically(2)](split-window-vertically(2)) command followed by a
  [find-file(2)](find-file(2)).

  When there is insufficient space in the current window to perform the
  split, then the current window is replaced. The requested _file_ is always
  displayed, if the file does not already exist it is effectively created
  within MicroEmacs (although it will not exist on the disk until a save
  operation is performed).

  The numeric argument _n_ can be used to modify the default behaviour of the
  command, where the bits are defined as follows:

  __0x01__
 
  >  If the file does not exist and this bit is not set the command fails
     at this point. If the file does not exist and this bit is set (or no
     argument is specified as the default argument is `1`) then a new empty
     buffer is created with the given file name, saving the buffer
     subsequently creates a new file.

  __0x02__
 
  >  If this bit is set the file will be loaded with [binary(2m)](binary(2m)) mode
     enabled. See help on __binary__ mode for more information on editing
     binary data files.

  __0x04__
 
  >  If this bit is set the file will be loaded with [crypt(2m)](crypt(2m)) mode
     enabled. See help on __crypt__ mode for more information on editing
     encrypted files.

  __0x08__
 
  >  If this bit is set the file will be loaded with [rbin(2m)](rbin(2m)) mode enabled.
     See help on __rbin__ mode for more information on efficient editing of
     binary data files.

## DESCRIPTION


  __split-window-vertically__ splits the current window vertically into two near
  equal windows, each displaying the buffer displayed by the original
  window. A numeric argument _n_ of 1 forces the upper window to be the new
  current window (default), and an argument of 2 forces the lower window to
  be the new current window.

## NAME


|print-color
  print-color - Create a new printer color
|print-scheme
  print-scheme - Create a new printer color and font scheme
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __print-color__ "_col-no_" "_red_" "_green_" "_blue_"  
  _n_ __print-scheme__ "_schemeNum_" "_fore_" "_back_" "_font-mask_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __print-color__ and __print-scheme__ are similar to [add-color(2)](add-color(2)) and
  [add-color-scheme(2)](add-color-scheme(2)) except they configure MicroEmacs's printer scheme.

  __print-color__ creates a new printer color and inserts it into the printer
  color table, where _red_, _green_ and _blue_ are the color components and _col-no_
  is the printer color index. The printer color table contains 256 entries
  indexed by _col-no_ in the range 0-255. __print-color__ may also be used to
  modify an existing _col-no_ index by re-assignment, the existing color
  definition is over-written with the new color definition.

  An argument _n_ of 0 to __print-color__ resets the printer color table, removing
  all currently defined colors.

  __print-scheme__ creates a new printer scheme. A printer scheme maps the
  [hilight(2)](hilight(2)) buffer's text into a print scheme. For example key words could
  be printed in _bold_ or in _blue_ etc. __print-scheme__ arguments comprise an
  identifying index number "_schemeNum_", two color values, "_fore_" and "_back_"
  (defined by __print-color__) and a font setting "_font-mask_". The _font-mask_ is
  a bit mask where each bit is defined as follows:

     `0x01` Enable bold font.
     `0x02` Enable italic font.
     `0x04` Enable light font.
     `0x08` Enable reverse font.
     `0x10` Enable underlining.

  An argument _n_ of 0 to __print-scheme__ resets the printer scheme table,
  removing all currently defined printer schemes.


## NOTES


  Printer schemes may be created and altered using the [scheme-editor(3)](scheme-editor(3))
  dialog, the created printer scheme may then be used directly in the
  [print-setup(3)](print-setup(3)) dialog. Therefore direct use of these commands is largely
  redundant.

! 2 shell-command
## NAME


  shell-command - Perform an operating system command
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __shell-command__ "_string_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __shell-command__ performs an operating system call with the given _string_ as
  its argument. The command only fails if the shell-command call returns -1.
  The [$result(5)]($result(5)) variable is set the return value and can be used to test
  the result.

  The argument _n_ can be used to change the default behavior of the
  shell-command, _n_ is a bit based flag where:-

  __0x01__
 
  >  When set shell-command waits for the command to complete, this is the
     default behavior. When not set the command is launched and forgotten
     about, the value returned in [$result(5)]($result(5)) will not reflect the exit code
     of the executed process itself.

  __0x04__
 
  >  Disable the use of the command-line processor to launch the program
     (win32 versions only). By default the "__command__" is launched by
     executing the command:

            %COMSPEC% /c command


  >  Where `%COMSPEC%` is typically command.com. If this bit is set, the
     "__command__" is launched directly.

  __0x08__
 
  >  Detach the launched process from MicroEmacs (win32 versions only). By
     default the command is launched as a child process of MicroEmacs with
     a new console. With this bit set the process is completely detached
     from MicroEmacs instead.

  __0x10__
 
  >  Disable the command name mangling (win32 versions only). By default
     any '`/`' characters found in the command name (the first argument only)
     are converted to '`\`' characters to make it Windows compliant.

  __0x20__
 
  >  Displays the new process window (win32 versions only), by default the
     window is hidden.

  __0x100__
 
  >  When set the command-line to be run is the first line of buffer
     _string_, this feature can be used to overcome the default 1024
     character command-line limit. When a multiple-line command-line is
     required, a negative argument can be given to [insert-string(2)](insert-string(2)).

  __0x200__
 
  >  No wait option, when set the the command is run without waiting for
     any completion status. This allows processes to be run and then
     forgotten about e.g. a Word processor, Adobe Acrobat reader etc.

! 2 show-region
## NAME


  show-region - Show the current copy region
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __show-region__


## DESCRIPTION


  __show-region__ manipulates the currently defined region, it can be used to
  inquire the state of the current region, if any. It can also be used to
  define a region, enable and disable the region hilighting, as well as move
  the cursor to the start or end of the region.

  Region hilighting occurs between the _mark_ (see [set-mark(2)](set-mark(2))) and _point_
  (current cursor) positions within the current buffer. A region is defined
  when text is copied to the kill buffer, by using any of the kill commands
  such as [kill-region(2)](kill-region(2)), or [copy-region(2)](copy-region(2)). However, the kill region is
  only visible after a [copy-region(2)](copy-region(2)) or a [yank(2)](yank(2)) operation. A hilight
  region is also created on a successful search using commands like
  [search-forward(2)](search-forward(2)), the region encloses the search matching string.
  [Spell(2)](spell(2)) also creates a hilight region around the current spell word. The
  user can also define their own region using the numeric argument to
  __show-region__.

  The argument _n_ supplied to the command indicates the require functionality
  and can take the following values:-

     `-3` - Set the start position of the region.
     `-2` - Move the cursor the  Mark position.
     `-1` - Disable the hilighting of the current region.
     ` 0` - Return the current status of the region in [$result(5)]($result(5)).
     ` 1` - Enable the hilighting of the current region.
     ` 2` - Move the cursor the  Dot position.
     ` 3` - Set the end position of the region.
     ` 4` - Reactivate the current region.

  Where an argument of 0 is used to return the current state the value of
  $result is a bit based flag where:-

  __0x01__
 
  >  Indicates a region is currently active (visible).

  __0x02__
 
  >  Indicates a region has been fixed (may not visible).

  __0x04__
 
  >  Indicates the region is in the current buffer.

  __0x08__
 
  >  Indicates the cursor is in the current region.

  The color of the selection hilight is defined by [add-color-scheme(2)](add-color-scheme(2)) and
  is determined by [$buffer-scheme(5)]($buffer-scheme(5)), [$global-scheme(5)]($global-scheme(5)) or
  [$buffer-hilight(5)]($buffer-hilight(5)).


## DIAGNOSTICS


  The following errors can be generated, in each case the command returns a
  FALSE status:

  __[No current region]__
 
  >  There is no current defined region on which to operate.

  __[Current region not in this buffer]__
 
  >  An argument of 2 or -2 was used and the defined region isn't in the
     current window so the cursor can not be moved to it.


## NOTES


  If no argument is given to the command it hilights the current region,
  similar to an argument of 1. But the properties of the hilight, namely how
  long it will be hilighted for, are inherited from the setting of
  [$show-region(5)]($show-region(5)), whereas if an argument of 1 is passed in then the
  hilighting is set to be kept until the region becomes invalid (i.e. as if
  [$show-region(5)]($show-region(5)) is set to 3).

! 2 translate-key
## NAME


  translate-key - Translate key
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __translate-key__ [ "_from_" ["_to_"] ]


## DESCRIPTION


  __translate-key__ may be used to convert any given input key sequence to
  another single key. __translate-key__ operates at a very low level, before
  MicroEmacs attempts to evaluate keyboard bindings, so it may be used to
  solve a variety of keyboard problems such as special language characters
  and UNIX termcap key sequence bindings (see below).

  If a positive numeric argument _n_ is given it is used to set the time in
  milliseconds MicroEmacs waits for another key to be pressed before
  continuing, the default time use when no argument is supplied is 250ms.

  If a numeric argument _n_ of -1 is specified then the "_to_" argument is not
  required and the "_from_" character sequence is removed from the translate
  key table.

  If a numeric argument _n_ of 0 is specified then no arguments are required;
  the current translation table is dumped to buffer "_*tcap-keys*_". Following
  is a sample output:-

            "C-h" ......................... "backspace"
            "C-[" ......................... "esc"
            "C-[ [ 1 ~" ................... "delete"
            "C-[ [ 1 1 ~" ................. "f1"
            "C-[ [ 1 2 ~" ................. "f2"
            "C-[ [ 1 3 ~" ................. "f3"
            "C-[ [ 1 4 ~" ................. "f4"
            "C-[ [ B" ..................... "down"
            "C-[ [ 4 ~" ................... "end"
            "C-[ [ 2 ~" ................... "insert"
            "C-[ [ 3 ~" ................... "home"
            "C-[ [ D" ..................... "left"
            "C-[ [ 6 ~" ................... "page-down"
            "C-[ [ 5 ~" ................... "page-up"
            "C-[ [ C" ..................... "right"
            "C-[ [ A" ..................... "up"
            "C-[ [ V" ..................... "page-up"
            "C-[ [ U" ..................... "page-down"
            "C-m" ......................... "return"
            "C-i" ......................... "tab"
            "\x7F" ........................ "backspace"


## FOREIGN KEYBOARDS 


  Foreign keyboards (non-US/UK) use a variety of key sequences, not
  recognized by MicroEmacs, to expand the keyboard character range to cope
  with accented characters. For example, on a German keyboard '`AltGr-m`'
  (recognized as '`A-C-m`') is used to insert a Greek mu (or micro sign). On a
  Belgian keyboard '`AltGr-9`' inserts a '{' character.

  Many foreign keyboards are already directly supported by MicroEmacs and
  the keyboard specifics of a country have been understood and resolved. In
  these cases the __Keyboard__ configuration in [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) may be used for
  the country location.

  If MicroEmacs does not support your keyboard, __translate-key__ may be used to
  fix any key input problems. For the aforementioned examples the following
  __translate-key__ commands would be required:

```{.emf}
        ; translate AltGr-m to a Greek mu (char 0xb5)
        translate-key "A-C-m" "\xB5"
        ; translate AltGr-9 to a '{'
        translate-key "A-C-9" "{"

```

  The problem is complicated further on Microsoft Window's platforms by the
  simultaneous generation of 2 keys for some Alt-Gr key combinations (this
  is a side effect of endeavoring to capture all key combinations in this
  environment). For the Belgian keyboard example, on Win32 platforms an
  '`AltGr-9`' generates an '`A-C-9`' key first followed immediately by an
  '`A-C-{`'. As both keys are generated in quick succession this is unexpected
  and confusing.

  When the key is first pressed on a poorly configured system the error
  "_[Key not bound "A-C-{"]_" is given even when using the command
  [describe-key(2)](describe-key(2)) as the key described will be 'A-C-9' and then the 'A-C-{'
  key is generated and interpreted creating the error message.

  The variable [$recent-keys(5)]($recent-keys(5)) can be used to diagnose this problem and to
  obtain the 2 keys generated; alternatively use the macro below:

```{.emf}
        define-macro report-2-keys
            ml-write "Press key 1"
            set-variable #l0 @cgk
            ml-write "Press key 2"
            set-variable #l1 @cgk
            ml-write &spr "[The following keys where pressed: \"%s\" \"%s\"]" #l0 #l1
        !emacro

```

  When executed the user is prompted for the first key; press the required
  key sequence (in this case '`AltGr-9`'), if you are not prompted for the
  second key and the result is immediately returned then the key you pressed
  has generated 2 keys, both of which will be given in the print out, i.e.:

     "[The following keys where pressed: "A-C-9" "A-C-{"]"


  The translate-key required to fix this type of problem would be:

```{.emf}
        translate-key "A-C-9 A-C-{" "{"

```

  If your keyboard is not directly supported by MicroEmacs, please submit
  the keyboard name and platform with a working translate-key configuration
  to [JASSPA](MicroEmacs - Contact Information) as a __BUG__.


## UNIX TERMCAP 


  __translate-key__ may also be used to interpret non-standard key sequences for
  UNIX termcap platforms to standard MicroEmacs keys. Non-standard keys,
  such as the cursor keys, have system dependent key sequences. The output
  from these keys usually take the form:

     `^[[X` or `^[[DX` or `^[[DDX` or `^[[DDD`

  where __^[__ is the escape key (27), __D__ is a digit and __X__ is any character.
  These keys may be bound to the standard keys, for example the typical
  output of the cursor keys may be translated as follows:-

     `^[[A` = __up__, `^[[B` = __down__, `^[[C` = __right__ and `^[[D` = __left__

  The "_from_" string is specified as this key sequence and the "_to_" string is
  simply the key it is to be bound to, see [global-bind-key(2)](global-bind-key(2)) for a guide to
  the string format. For the above example the following set of translations
  are required:-

```{.emf}
        translate-key "esc [ A" "up"
        translate-key "esc [ B" "down"
        translate-key "esc [ C" "right"
        translate-key "esc [ D" "left"

```

  Note that MicroEmacs interprets `\e` as an escape key. More obscure keys
  tend to be very platform specific, following are some examples:

```{.emf}
        translate-key "esc [ 2 ~" "insert"
        translate-key "esc [ 5 ~" "page-up"
        translate-key "esc [ 5 ^" "C-page-up"

```


## EXAMPLE


  Using the positive numeric argument it is possible to reduce the delay and
  there by increase usability is some features. For instance, in the Mouse
  configuration of __user-setup__ there is an option to 'Simulate 3 Buttons'
  which translates a rapid left and right button press into a middle button
  press. This is implemented using __translate-key__ as follows:

```{.emf}
        10 translate-key "mouse-pick-1 mouse-pick-3" "mouse-pick-2"
        10 translate-key "mouse-pick-3 mouse-pick-1" "mouse-pick-2"
        10 translate-key "mouse-drop-1 mouse-drop-3" "mouse-drop-2"
        10 translate-key "mouse-drop-3 mouse-drop-1" "mouse-drop-2"

```

  When a `mouse-pick-1` key is generated MicroEmacs must wait to see if a
  `mouse-pick-3` key is next and therefore translate both to a single
  `mouse-pick-2` key. This wait time is usually a quarter of a second but this
  makes the left button unusable for dragging regions etc as the delay is
  too long. By giving a argument of 10ms the delay is long enough for a
  simultaneous left and right button press but short enough for the left
  button to still be usable on its own.

  The positive numeric argument can be very useful for delaying MicroEmacs
  as well, for example, the character string "`'e`" can be converted to
  e-accute using [expand-iso-accents(3)](expand-iso-accents(3)). This could be performed
  automatically using translate-key as follows:

```{.emf}
        1000 translate-key "' e" "\xE9"

```

  The larger 1 second delay give the user enough time to type the '`e`' after
  the '`'`' character.


## Known Translations 


  The following are a set of known translations courtesy of __-Th__.

```{.emf}

        translate-key "C-[ [ F" "end"
        translate-key "C-[ [ 1 ; 5 H" "c-home"
        translate-key "C-[ [ 1 ; 5 F" "c-end"

        translate-key "C-[ [ 5 ; 5 ~" "C-page-up"
        translate-key "C-[ [ 6 ; 5 ~" "C-page-down"
        translate-key "C-[ [ 2 9 ~" "menu" ; context menu key

```

## NOTES


  The concept of standardized key-bindings is very important for cross
  platform use and maintenance.

  Refer to [global-bind-key(2)](global-bind-key(2)) for a list of standard bindings.

  One of the easiest ways of obtaining a key sequence is to run __sh(1)__ which
  does not attempt to interpret these keys so when a key is pressed
  (followed by `<RETURN>`) the following type of error message is usually
  generated:-

     sh: ^[[2~:  not found.


  where `^[[2~` is the required key sequence. Another method of obtaining
  these key sequences is to start MicroEmacs 2009, use [start-kbd-macro(2)](start-kbd-macro(2)) to
  start a macro definition, press the required keys and then use
  [end-kbd-macro(2)](end-kbd-macro(2)) followed by [name-kbd-macro(2)](name-kbd-macro(2)) and [insert-macro(2)](insert-macro(2)) to
  display the keys pressed.

  The key sequences generated for these keys are dependent on the machine
  displaying MicroEmacs 2009 as opposed to the machine running it. Often
  they are the same machine, but when they are not there is no easy method
  of determining the displaying machine and therefore correctly configuring
  MicroEmacs 2009.

  A better way of obtaining this cross platform consistency is to create an
  XTerm app-defaults setup file with the correct VT100 key translations,
  e.g. the setup file could contain the following


     *vt100.translations: #override \
         Shift<Key>Tab:  string("\033[Z") \n\
         <Key>BackSpace:  string("\177") \n\
         <Key>Delete:  string("\033[1~") \n\
         <Key>Insert:  string("\033[2~") \n\
         <Key>Home:  string("\033[3~") \n\
         <Key>End:  string("\033[4~") \n\
         <Key>Prior:  string("\033[5~") \n\
         <Key>Next:  string("\033[6~") \n\
         Ctrl<Key>Up:  string("\033Oa") \n\
         Ctrl<Key>Down:  string("\033Ob") \n\
         Ctrl<Key>Right:  string("\033Oc") \n\
         Ctrl<Key>Left:  string("\033Od") \n\
         Shift<Key>Up:  string("\033[a") \n\
         Shift<Key>Down:  string("\033[b") \n\
         Shift<Key>Right: string("\033[c") \n\
         Shift<Key>Left:  string("\033[d") \n


  By using the environment variable _XUSERFILESEARCHPATH_ to ensure that this
  configuration file is found instead of the system one (found in
  `/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults`), the key sequences will then be the same across
  all platforms. See manual page on __xterm(1)__ for more information.

! 2 set-char-mask
## NAME


  set-char-mask - Set character word mask
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __set-char-mask__ "_flags_" ["_value_"]


## DESCRIPTION


  __set-char-mask__ returns or modifies the setting of MicroEmacs internal
  character tables. The argument _n_ defines the action to be taken, as
  follows:-

  __-1__
 
  >  Removes characters from the given set.

  __0__
 
  >  Returns characters in the given set in [$result(5)]($result(5)).

  __1__
 
  >  Adds characters to the given set.

  The first argument "_flags_" determines the required character set as
  follows:-

  __d__
 
  >  Is Displayable. Characters in this set can be directly displayed to
     the screen (as a single character) when occurring in a buffer. When a
     character not in this set is to be displayed it is performed using
     more than one character. Characters in the range 1-31 are displayed as
     "`^?`" where `?` is the ASCII character plus 64, (e.g. 0x01 -> 65, i.e.
     "`^A`") otherwise the character is displayed in the form "`\xhh`" where `hh`
     is the hex form of the ASCII value. One notable exception is the tab
     character (0x09), by default this character is not displayable,
     instead it is displayed as a sequence of one or more spaces up to the
     next tab stop.

  __p__
 
  >  Is Pokable. Similar to __d__, characters in this set can be poked to the
     screen when using [screen-poke(2)](screen-poke(2)). When found in a binary file the
     character is displayed in the right hand column. Unlike __d__, any
     character outside this set will be displayed as a single period '`.`',
     indicating that it cannot be displayed.

  __P__
 
  >  Is Printable. Similar to __d__, characters in this set may be printed as a
     single character when using [print-buffer(2)](print-buffer(2)) or [print-region(2)](print-region(2)). Any
     character not in this set is printed in a similar fashion to __d__.

  __M__
 
  >  Character font Map. Internally MicroEmacs uses ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) to
     configure alphabetic classes and the spell-checker, however the system
     font being used by the native platform may not be the same, for
     example a small 'e' acute is character 0xe9 in ISO-8859-1 but
     character 0x82 in Windows OEM fonts. To change the characteristics of
     the 'e' acute character (such as making it an alphabetic character),
     the ISO-8859-1 character should always be used, but a correct mapping
     of ISO-8859-1 to the display font (such as Windows OEM) must also be
     supplied.

  >  Unlike other sets, this set cannot be incrementally altered, any calls
     to alter this set leads to the resetting of all the character tables
     so the character mapping must be performed first and in a single call.
     No other set may be altered in the same call. When setting, the
     "_value_" must supply pairs of characters, an ISO-8859-1 character
     followed by its system font equivalent.

  __L__
 
  >  ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) character map list. This set cannot be altered
     using this flag, character mappings must be set up using flag __M__. The
     order of the characters in the returned __$result__ string is the same as
     the order for flag __U__.

  __U__
 
  >  User font character map list. This set cannot be altered using this
     flag, character mappings must be set up using flag __M__. The order of the
     characters in __$result__ when returned is the same as the order for flag
     __L__.

  __a__
 
  >  Is Alphabetic letter. Characters in this set are alphabetical
     characters, used by many MicroEmacs commands such as [forward-word(2)](forward-word(2)).
     When setting, the "_value_" must specify pairs of ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1)
     characters, an Upper-case character followed by its lower-case
     equivalent. This enables commands such as [lower-case-word(2)](lower-case-word(2)) to
     operate correctly regardless of the font and language being used. Some
     fonts may not have all the characters available for rendering, for
     instance PC Code page 437 does not have an upper-case 'e' grave. In
     this case an ordinary 'E' should be used as a sensible replacement,
     i.e. "E`e" (where `e is an 'e' grave). However, this will lead to all
     upper-case 'E's to map to a lower-case 'e' grave in a case changing
     operation, this may be corrected by adding a further mapping of 'E' to
     'e' to over-ride the 'e' grave mapping, i.e. "E`eEe". This technique
     does fail when changing the case more than once, when all lower case
     'e' graves will be lost.

     Note that the returned character list will pair all lower-case
     characters with their upper-case equivalent letters first.

  __l__
 
  >  Is Lower case letter. This set cannot be altered using this flag,
     alterations to the alphabetic set must be performed using flag __a__.
     Characters in this set are all the lower-case letters, typically the
     characters '`a`' to '`z`'. The order may not be the same as returned by
     flag __u__.

  __u__
 
  >  Is Upper case letter. This set cannot be altered using this flag,
     alterations to the alphabetic set must be performed using flag __a__.
     Characters in this set are all the upper-case letters, typically the
     characters '`A`' to '`Z`'. The order may not be the same as returned by

  __h__
 
  >  Is Hex-decimal Digit. The set is rarely used as it is invariably the
     digits '`0`' to '`9`' and the letters '`a`' to '`f`' in upper and lower case.
     It is often used in the setting of [$buffer-mask(5)]($buffer-mask(5)).

  __A__
 
  >  Is Alpha-numeric. This set cannot be altered using this flag,
     alterations to the alphabetic set must be performed using flag __a__.
     Characters in this set are either alphabetic characters or the digits
     0-9.

  __s__
 
  >  Is Spell extended word character. The characters in this set are
     recognized by the spell checker as characters which may be considered
     part of a word, for example the period '`.`'s in e.g. or the hyphen '`-`'
     in hyphenated-words. Typically this set contains the characters '`'`',
     '`-`' and '`.`'.

  __1__, __2__, __3__ & __4__
 
  >  Is in Word. These user definable sets are used to add characters to a
     buffer's word character set, affecting the operation of commands like
     [forward-word(2)](forward-word(2)). Many different file types operate better with a
     different word character set, e.g. it is preferable to include the '`_`'
     character when editing C files. See variable [$buffer-mask(5)]($buffer-mask(5)).

  __k__
 
  >  Keyboard character map. This flag is used to configure a mapping from
     a foreign non-latin keyboard (such as Russian) to Latin characters,
     setting the mapping correctly can greatly improve usability in
     MicroEmacs as changing keyboards is required less frequently. The
     mapping is used by character input routines which first check the main
     key typed (e.g. the Cyrillic character) and if not bound or invalid
     MicroEmacs uses this keyboard mapping to translate the character into
     a Latin character. This allows the user to execute binding such as
     "`C-x k`" or responding to "`[y/n]`" prompts without having to change
     keyboards.

  >  As with flag __M__, this cannot be incrementally altered, any call to set
     this mapping first resets the mapping table so the mapping must be
     performed in a single call. No other set may be altered in the same
     call. When setting, the "_value_" must supply pairs of characters, the
     ISO-8859 non-latin character followed by its latin character mapping.

  Unless stated otherwise, multiple flags may be specified at the same time
  returning a combined character set or setting multiple properties for the
  given "_value_" characters.


## EXAMPLE


  For many UNIX XTerm fonts the best characters to use for [$box-chars(5)]($box-chars(5))
  (used in drawing [osd(2)](osd(2)) dialogs) lie in the range 0x0B to 0x19. For
  example the vertical bar is '`\x19`', the top left hand corner is '`\x0D`'
  etc. These characters are by default set to be not displayable or pokable
  which renders them useless. They can be made displayable and pokable as
  follows:-

```{.emf}
        set-char-mask "dp" "\x19\x0D\x0C\x0E\x0B\x18\x15\x0F\x16\x17\x12"

```

  MicroEmacs variables have either '`$`', '`#`', '`%`', '`:`' or a '`.`' character
  prepended to their name, they may also contain a '`-`' character in the body
  of their name. It is preferable for these characters to be part of the
  variable 'word' so commands like [forward-kill-word(2)](forward-kill-word(2)) can work correctly.
  This may be achieved by adding these characters to user set __2__ and setting
  the __buffer-mask__ variable to include set __2__, as follows:

```{.emf}
        set-char-mask "2" "$#%:.-"

        define-macro fhook-emf
            set-variable $buffer-mask "luh2"
            .
            .
        !emacro

```

  For the examples below only the following subset of characters will be
  used:-

     Character               ISO-8859-1    Windows OEM    PC Page 437

     Capital A (A)           A             A              A
     Capital A grave (`A)    \xC0          \xB7           No equivalent
     Capital A acute ('A)    \xC1          \x90           No equivalent
     Small a (a)             a             a              a
     Small A grave (`a)      \xE0          \x85           \x85
     Small A acute ('a)      \xE1          \xA0           \xA0


  As the spell checker only operates in ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1), the character
  font mapping (flag __M__) must be correctly setup for spell checking to
  operate correctly. For ISO-8859-1 (ISO) this is an empty string as the
  default mapping is correct, but for both Windows OEM (OEM) and PC Code
  Page 437 (PC-437) the mappings should be set as follows:-

```{.emf}
        ; OEM font mapping setup
        set-char-mask "M" "\xC0\xB7\xC1\x90\xE0\x85\xE1\xA0"
        ; PC-437 font mapping setup
        set-char-mask "M" "\xC0A\xC1AAA\xE0\x85\xE1\xA0"

```

  As all the characters in ISO have equivalents in OEM, the mapping for OEM
  is a simple ISO to OEM character list. However the missing capital __A__'s in
  PC-437 cause problems, for the command [charset-iso-to-user(3)](charset-iso-to-user(3)) it is
  preferable for a mapping of __`A__ to be given, otherwise the document being
  converted may remain unreadable. Therefore a mapping of __`A__ to __A__ is given
  to alleviate this problem, similarly __'A__ is also mapped to __A__.

  This leads to a similar problem with the conversion of PC-437 back to ISO
  (the operation of command [charset-user-to-iso(3)](charset-user-to-iso(3))). If only the mapping of
  "`\xC0A\xC1A`" was given, the last mapping (__'A__ to __A__) would also be the back
  conversion for __A__, i.e. ALL __A__'s would be converted back to __'A__'s. To solve
  this problem, a further seemingly pointless mapping of __A__ to __A__ is given to
  correct the back conversion.

  For languages which use these characters, the alphabetic character set
  must be extended to include these characters for letter based commands
  like [forward-word(2)](forward-word(2)) and [upper-case-word(2)](upper-case-word(2)) to operate correctly. The
  addition of extra letters must achieve two goals, firstly to define
  whether a character is a letter, enabling commands like __forward-word__ to
  work correctly. The second is to provide an upper case to lower case
  character mapping, enabling commands like __upper-case-word__ to work
  correctly. This is achieved with a single call to __set-char-mask__ using the
  __a__ flag as follows:-

```{.emf}
        set-char-mask "a" "\xC0\xE0\xC1\xE1"

```

  Note that this flag always expects a ISO-8859-1 character, this allows the
  same map character list to be used regardless of the font set being used,
  i.e. the above line can be used for ISO, OEM and PC-437 fonts. But it does
  mean that the ISO to user font character mapping (flag __M__) must already
  have been performed.

  Similar problems are encountered with the __M__ flag with font PC-437. This
  problem is not immediately obvious because the mapping is given in ISO,
  but when this is converted to PC-437, the mapping string becomes
  "`A\x85A\xA0`". As can be seen, __A__ is mapped last to __'a__ so an upper to lower
  character operation will convert a __A__ to __'a__. A similar solution is used, a
  further mapping of __A__ to __a__ is given to correct the default case mapping for
  both __A__ and __a__, i.e. the following line should always be used instead:-

```{.emf}
        set-char-mask "a" "\xC0\xE0\xC1\xE1Aa"

```

  __transpose-chars__ exchanges (swaps) the current character under the cursor
  with the previous character. __transpose-characters__ does not operate in
  column 0 (since there is no previous character). If the cursor is at the
  end of a line when the command is initiated then the cursor is moved to
  the previous character and the operation performed from the new position.

  __transpose-lines__ swaps the next line for the current line and moves to the
  next line, effectively retaining the same text position. Repeating this _n_
  times moves the current line _n_ lines down.


## EXAMPLE


  __transpose-character__ performs the following operations (cursor at __^__):-

     abcde  => acbde         [Middle of line]
          ^         ^

     abcde  => abced         [End of line]
             ^         ^

! 2 undo
## NAME


  undo - Undo the last edit
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __undo__ (__C-x u__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __undo__ removes the last _n_ edits made to the current buffer. The [undo(2m)](undo(2m))
  buffer mode must be enabled for this command to operate.

  The undo information is retained up until the next save operation, at
  which point the undo information is discarded. When editing large files
  with gross changes then it is advisable to either disable undo mode, or
  save frequently to flush the undo buffer, thereby keeping MicroEmacs 2009
  memory requirements reasonable (most UNIX users have restrictions on the
  amount of memory that may be consumed by a single process. Windows is
  restricted by the amount of virtual memory (or swap space)).

! 2 universal-argument
## NAME


  universal-argument - Set the command argument count
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __universal-argument__ (__C-u__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __universal-argument__ sets the argument number passed to a command to 4^_n_ (4
  to the power of _n_) where _n_ is the number of calls to __universal-argument__,
  e.g. the key sequence "`C-uC-n`" moves down 4 lines, "`C-uC-uC-uC-n`" moves
  down 4*4*4 = 64 lines.

  After invoking the __universal-command__ a '_-_' character can be pressed to
  negate the argument value, and an alternative numeric argument can be
  entered using the '_0_' to '_9_' keys.

  Invoking this command via [execute-named-command(2)](execute-named-command(2)) or by a macro has no
  effect. The command should be treated as a command key prefix (like
  [prefix(2)](prefix(2))) in that it may be bound to only one key sequence which must be
  a single key stroke. Re-binding this command to another key unbinds the
  new key and also the current __universal-argument__ key.

  The __prefix 1__ key (by default bound to `esc`) may also be used to enter a
  numeric argument at the message line, e.g. "`esc 1 0 C-f`" will move forward
  10 characters.

! 2 add-spell-rule
## NAME


  add-spell-rule - Add a new spelling rule to the dictionary
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __add-spell-rule__ [ "_rule-letter_" "_base-ending_" "_remove_" "_derive-ending_" ]


## DESCRIPTION


  __add-spell-rule__ adds a new spelling rule to the speller. The rules
  effectively define the prefix and suffix character replacements of words,
  which is given an alphabetical identifier used within the speller , in
  conjunction with the language dictionary. The letter conventions are
  defined by the __Free Software Foundation__ GNU __ispell(1)__ package.

  __add-spell-rule__ is used in the MicroEmacs 2009 dictionary initialization
  files called _<language>_r.emf, e.g. `americar.erf`, `britishr.erf` supplied in
  the MicroEmacs macros directory.

  The command takes a single numeric argument _n_ to control the addition of a
  rule to the speller, as follows:-

  `0` __add-spell-rule__
 
  >  Removes all existing rules and re-initializes. This is, by convention,
     explicitly called before instantiating a new set of rules.

  `-1` __add-spell-rule__ "_rule-letter_" "_base-ending_" "" "_deriv-ending_"

  `-2` __add-spell-rule__ "_rule-letter_" "_base-ending_" "" "_deriv-ending_"

  >  Adds a prefix rule, an argument of -1 indicates that this prefix rule
     cannot be used with a suffix rule. An argument of -2 indicates it can
     be matched with any suffix rule which can be used with a prefix rule
     (e.g. argument of 2).

  >  "_rule-letter_" is any character in the range `A`-`z` except '`_`', all rules
     of the given letter must be a prefix rule of the same type (i.e. same
     argument). The start of a base word must match the given "_base-ending_"
     regular expression string for the rule to be applied, the "_remove_"
     string must be empty for a prefix and the "_deriv-ending_" is the prefix
     string. Example, for the American language;-

         `-2 add-spell-rule "I" "" "" "in"` ; As in disposed > indisposed

  >  A prefix rule of type '`I`' can be applied to any base word which has
     rule '`I`' enabled, and it prefixes "`in`" to the word.

 `1` __add-spell-rule__ "_rule-letter_" "_base-ending_" "_remove_" "_deriv-ending_"

 `2` __add-spell-rule__ "_rule-letter_" "_base-ending_" "_remove_" "_deriv-ending_"
 
  >  Add suffix rules. An argument of 1 indicates that this prefix rule
     cannot be used with a prefix rule. An argument of 2 indicates it can
     be matched with any prefix rule which can be used with a suffix rule
     (i.e. argument of -2).

  >  "_rule-letter_" is any character in the range `A`-`z`, all rules of the
     given letter must be a suffix rule of the same type (i.e. same
     argument). The end of a base word must match the given "_base-ending_"
     regular expression string for the rule to be applied, the "_remove_"
     string must be a fixed string and the "_deriv-ending_" must also be a
     fixed string which is appended to the base-word after "_remove_" has
     been removed. Example, for the American language;-

```{.emf}
            2 add-spell-rule "N" "e" "e" "ion"     ; As in create > creation
            2 add-spell-rule "N" "y" "y" "ication" ; As in multiply > multiplication
            2 add-spell-rule "N" "[^ey]" "" "en"   ; As in fall > fallen

```

  >  A suffix rule of type '`N`' can be applied to any base word which has
     rule '`N`' enabled, and it can be used with prefixes, e.g. with rule;-

```{.emf}
            -2 add-spell-rule "A" "" "" "re"       ; As in enter > reenter

```

  >  to derive "_recreation_" from "_create_". A rule which cannot be used with
     prefixes, i.e.:

```{.emf}
            1 add-spell-rule "V" "e" "e" "ive"     ; As in create > creative
            1 add-spell-rule "V" "[^e]" "" "ive"   ; As in prevent > preventive

```

  >  While some prefix words are legal, such as "_recreative_" but some are
     not, such as "_collect_" where "_recollect_" is correct, so is
     "_collective_" but "_recollective_" is not.


## SPECIAL RULES 


  Following are special forms of add-spell-rule used for tuning the spell
  support, note that an argument can not be given:-

  __add-spell-rule__ "_-_" "<_y_|_n_>"

  >  Enables and disables the acceptance of hyphens joining correct words.
     By default the phrase "`out-of-date`" would be accepted in American even
     though the phrase does not exist in the American dictionary. This is
     because the three words making up the phrase are correct and by
     default hyphens joining words are allowed. Some Latin language such as
     Spanish do not use this concept so this feature can be disable.

  __add-spell-rule__ "_#_" "_score_"

  >  Sets the maximum allowed error score when creating a spelling guess
     list. When comparing a dictionary word with the user supplied word,
     __spell__ checks for differences, each difference or error is scored in
     the range of 20 to 27 points, once the maximum allowed score has been
     exceeded the word is ignored. The default guess error score is 60,
     allowing for 2 errors.

  __add-spell-rule__ "_*_" "_regex_"

  >  Adds a correct word in the form of a [regex](RegularExpressions(2)) if a word being spell
     checked is completely matched by the __regex__ the word is deemed to be
     correct. For example, the following rule can be used to make the
     spell-checker allow all hex numbers:

```{.emf}
        add-spell-rule "*" "0[xX][[:xdigit:]]+"

```

  This will completely match the words "`0x0`", "`0xff`" etc but not "`0x00z`" as
  the whole word is not matched, only the first 4 letters.


## NOTES


  The format of the dictionary is a list of base words with each word having
  a list of rules which can be applied to that word. Therefore the list of
  words and the rules used for them are linked e.g.

     aback
     abaft
     abandon/DGRS
     abandonment/S
     abase/DGRS
     abasement/S
     abash/DGS
     abashed/U
     abate/DGRS


  where the "`/...`" is the valid list of rules for that word.

  The '_' character is used to separate different rule lists for a single
  word.

  The format of the dictionary word list and the rule list is compatible
  with __ispell(1)__.

! 2 screen-update
## NAME


  screen-update - Force screen update
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __screen-update__ (__redraw__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __screen-update__ updates the current screen, usually used in macros. The
  argument _n_ can be used to change the behaviour of this command as follows:

  _negative n_
  
  >  Disables the next -_n_ screen updates, i.e. if _n_ is `-1` then the next
     time the screen needs to be redrawn nothing will happen.

  `0`
 
  >  Resets the screen update disable count to zero, useful to remember
     when the the disable feature has been used incorrectly.

  `1`
 
  >  Full screen update (default), the screen is completely cleared and
     redrawn (as if garbled).

  `2`
 
  >  Partial screen update, only the parts of the screen which require
     updating are redrawn.

  `3`
 
  >  No screen redraw, only window variables are up-dated. This feature is
     provided for macros which manipulate the screen view and need to know
     where the cursor is in the window without redrawing the screen (which
     may cause unwanted flickering). Note that as the screen is not redrawn
     not all variables may have the correct value, for example the frame
     store variable [@fs(4)](@fs(4)) could be out of date.


## EXAMPLES


  The following macro demonstrates the problems encountered when trying to
  use screen variables in macros after the current position has changed. The
  first value printed is the starting cursor Y position and the next value
  should be one less than the first value due to the call to
  [backward-line(2)](backward-line(2)). But it is the same as the first because the screen (and
  its variables) have not been updated. The subsequent call to screen-update
  ensures that the third value is the correct one although by giving it an
  argument of 3 the screen is not visibly updated thus avoiding any annoying
  screen flicker:

```{.emf}
        define-macro test-screen-update
            set-variable #l0 $cursor-y
            backward-line
            set-variable #l1 $cursor-y
            3 screen-update
            set-variable #l2 $cursor-y
            forward-line
            ml-write &spr "%d %d %d" #l0 #l1 #l2
        !emacro

```

## NOTES


  Every time the screen requires updating, MicroEmacs executes the _redraw_
  key, it is similar in mechanism to the user pressing _C-l_ to refresh the
  screen. The user can therefore re-bind the _redraw_ key to another command
  or macro, thereby allowing the user complete control of what is displayed.
  For example if _redraw_ was bound to [void(2)](void(2)) the screen would not be
  up-dated (__Note__: this is difficult to get out of and may require MicroEmacs
  to be killed).

  This feature is often exploited by macros which take control of the input
  and output, such macros include [gdiff(3)](gdiff(3)), [Metris(3)](Metris(3)), and [Mahjongg(3)](Mahjongg(3)).

! 2 view-file
## NAME


  view-file - Load a file read only
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __view-file__ "_file-name_" (__C-x C-v__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __view-file__ is like [find-file(2)](find-file(2)), and either finds the file in a buffer, or
  creates a new buffer and reads the file in. A new file is left in [view(2m)](view(2m))
  mode if the file was found (i.e. cannot be edited).

  The numeric argument _n_ can be used to modify the default behaviour of the
  command, where the bits are defined as follows:

  __0x01__
  
  >  If the file does not exist and this bit is not set the command fails
     at this point. If the file does not exist and this bit is set (or no
     argument is specified as the default argument is `1`) then a new empty
     buffer is created with the given file name, saving the buffer
     subsequently creates a new file.

  __0x02__
  
  >  If this bit is set the file will be loaded with [binary(2m)](binary(2m)) mode
     enabled. See help on __binary__ mode for more information on editing
     binary data files.

  __0x04__
  
  >  If this bit is set the file will be loaded with [crypt(2m)](crypt(2m)) mode
     enabled. See help on __crypt__ mode for more information on editing
     encrypted files.

  __0x08__
  
  >  If this bit is set the file will be loaded with [rbin(2m)](rbin(2m)) mode enabled.
     See help on __rbin__ mode for more information on efficient editing of
     binary data files.

  __0x10__
  
  >  If this bit is set then the file hook evaluation is not performed when
     the file is loaded (i.e. the [buffer's file hook](fileHooks(2)) is not executed).

! 2 write-buffer
## NAME


  write-buffer - Write contents of buffer to named (new) file
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __write-buffer__ "_file-name_" (__C-x C-w__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __write-buffer__ is used to write the contents of the buffer to a NEW file,
  use [save-buffer(2)](save-buffer(2)) if the buffer is to be written to the existing file
  already associated with the buffer.

  __write-buffer__ writes the contents of the current buffer to the named file
  _file-name_. The action of the write also changes the file name associated
  with the current buffer to the new file name.

  Unlike [append-buffer(2)](append-buffer(2)), __write-buffer__ always replaces an existing file and
  the new file inherits the buffers file characteristics instead of the old
  file's.

  On writing the file, if [time(2m)](time(2m)) mode is enabled then the [time stap]($timestamp(5))
  is searched for in the file and modified if located, to reflect the
  modification date and time.

  If the buffer contains a [narrow(2m)](narrow(2m)) it will automatically be removed
  before saving so that the whole buffer is saved and restored when saving
  is complete

  If [backup(2m)](backup(2m)) mode is enabled and the buffer is associated with a
  different file (compared with _file-name_) then any [automatic save]($auto-time(5)) copies of
  the file associated with the _buffer_ are deleted.

  The argument _n_ may be used to change the default behavior of write-buffer
  described above, _n_ is a bit based flag where:-

  __0x01__
  
  >  Enables validity checks (default). These include a check that the
     proposed file does not already exist, if so confirmation of writing is
     requested from the user. Also MicroEmacs 2009 checks all other current
     buffers for one with the proposed file name, if found, again
     confirmation is requested. Without this flag the command will always
     succeed wherever possible.

  __0x02__
  
  >  Disables the expansion of any narrows (see [narrow-buffer(2)](narrow-buffer(2))) before
     saving the buffer.


## NOTES


  [undo(2)](undo(2)) information may be discarded when the file is written.

! 2 ml-write
## NAME


  ml-write - Write message on message line
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _0_ __ml-write__  
  _n_ __ml-write__ "_message_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __ml-write__ writes the argument "_message_" to the message line. If a positive
  numeric argument _n_ is specified then the message is displayed with a _n_
  milliseconds uninterruptible delay allowing the user time to see the
  message.

  The arguments to __ml-write__ are defined as follows:-

  _No argument_
  
  >  The default form, writes a _message_ to the command line with no delay.

  _+ve_

  >   Displays the _message_ on the message line and waits _n_ milliseconds
     before proceeding with the next command.

  `0`
 
  >  the _message_ argument is not required and the command clears the
     message line. This may be used to clear any previous message from the
     last command(s) in a script and is equivalent to the old MicroEmacs
     command __ml-clear__.

  `-1`
  
  >  Writes the _message_ to _standard out_. A carriage return (`'\n'`) is
     automatically added to the end of the _message_ to create a line on the
     given stream.

  `-2`
  
  >  Writes the _message_ to _standard error_, the behaviour is the same as
     standard output (`-1` option)


## NOTES


  If the argument value is not `-1` or `-2` calls to __ml-write__ are ignored in
  standard MicroEmacs piped mode (command-line option __-p__). They are printed
  to _standard error_ when debug piped mode is used (command-line option __-P__,
  see [me(1)](me(1))), making the debugging and maintenance of macro based piped
  processing easier.

  In previous releases the command __ml-clear__ was used to clear the message
  line, this command was replaced by `0 ml-write` in December 2004.


## EXAMPLE


  The following call displays a message on the message-line with a 2 second
  pause:

```{.emf}
        2000 ml-write "Hello World!"

```

  The following [start-up(3)](start-up(3)) macro may be used to add a header and footer
  line to a file piped to _standard in_, writing the output to _standard out_.

```{.emf}
        define-macro start-up
            find-buffer "*stdin*"
            ml-write &spr "DEBUG: Read %d lines from stdin" $window-eline
            ml-write &spr "DEBUG: About to write header"
            -1 ml-write "<<<HEADER>>>"
            ml-write &spr "DEBUG: About to write body"
            0 save-buffer
            ml-write &spr "DEBUG: About to write footer"
            -1 ml-write "<<<FOOTER>>>"
            -2 ml-write &spr "%d lines written to stdout" &add $window-eline 2
            quick-exit
        !emacro

```

  To run this example save this macro in a new macro file (such as
  `mlwrite_test.emf`) and in a shell run:

     cat input_file | me -n -p @mlwrite_test - > output_file


  Note the `DEBUG` lines will be printed if __-P__ option is used. Also see
  example given for [command-wait(2)](command-wait(2)).

! 2 yank
## NAME


  yank - Paste (copy) kill buffer contents into buffer
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __yank__ (__C-y__)


## DESCRIPTION


  When a non negative argument is supplied to __yank__, the command copies the
  contents of the kill buffer _n_ times into the current buffer at the current
  cursor position. This does not clear the kill buffer, and therefore may be
  used to make multiple copies of a section of text. On windowing systems
  which support clip-boards, such as windows and X-terms, MicroEmacs will
  also cut to and paste from the global clip-board.

  If _yank_ is IMMEDIATELY followed by a [reyank(2)](reyank(2)) then the _yanked_ text is
  replaced by text of the next entry in the kill ring. (another __reyank__
  replaces the text with the previous reyank text and so on).

  If an negative argument is given, __yank__ removes the last 0-_n_ items from the
  kill ring.

  Text is inserted into the kill buffer by one of the following commands:-

  [backward-kill-word(2)](backward-kill-word(2)), [copy-region(2)](copy-region(2)), [forward-kill-word(2)](forward-kill-word(2)),
  [kill-line(2)](kill-line(2)), [kill-paragraph(2)](kill-paragraph(2)), [kill-region(2)](kill-region(2)),
  [forward-delete-char(2)](forward-delete-char(2)), [backward-delete-char(2)](backward-delete-char(2)).

  All the above commands (except __copy-region__) cut text out of the buffer,
  the last two character delete commands require the presence of a numeric
  argument to add the deleted text to the kill buffer. If any of these
  commands are executed immediately after any other (including itself) or
  the [@cl(4)](@cl(4)) variable is set to one of these command, the new kill text is
  appended to the last kill buffer text.


## NOTES


  Windowing systems such as X-Windows and Microsoft Windows utilize a global
  windowing kill buffer allowing data to be moved between windowing
  applications (_cut buffer_ and _clipboard_, respectively). Within these
  environments MicroEmacs 2009 automatically interacts with the windowing
  systems kill buffer, the last MicroEmacs 2009 kill buffer entry is
  immediately available for a _paste_ operation into another application
  (regardless of how it was inserted into the kill buffer). Conversely, data
  placed in the windowing kill buffer is available to MicroEmacs 2009, via
  __yank__, until a new item has been inserted into the kill buffer (the data
  may still be available via [reyank(2)](reyank(2))).


## EXAMPLE


  The following example is a basic macro code implementation of the
  [transpose-lines(2)](transpose-lines(2)) command,

```{.emf}
        beginning-of-line
        kill-line
        forward-line
        yank
        -1 yank
        backward-line

```

  Note that similar to __transpose-lines__ it does not leave the moved line in
  the kill buffer, effectively tidying up after itself.

! 2 define-macro-file
## NAME


  define-macro-file - Define macro file location
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __define-macro-file__ "_file-name_" ["_macro-name_" "_macro2-name_" ...]


## DESCRIPTION


  Macros are loaded as late as possible using an on-demand mechanism, this
  speeds up the load time of MicroEmacs 2009, it also keeps the startup file
  clean since macros are not defined within the start-up file. Only when the
  user first executes a macro defined via __define-macro-file__ is the file
  loaded, the macro becomes defined and is executed. Subsequent calls to the
  macro will not reload the file as the macro will now be fully defined.

  __define-macro-file__ binds macros (_macro-name_ ...) to a file name
  (_file-name_). This operation informs MicroEmacs 2009 which file should be
  loaded when _macro-name_ is first executed. The _macro-name_ arguments may be
  omitted if the file contains only one exported macro which has the same
  name as _file-name_.

  Alternatively the macro file may contain many macros all of which can be
  defined by a single call to __define-macro-file__, listing all macros on the
  same line after the _file-name_. If a _macro-name_ is given then the default
  macro _file-name_ is not created, if a macro of that name does exist it must
  be added to the _macro-name_ list.


## EXAMPLE


  The following definitions are found in the `me.emf` start-up file:-

```{.emf}
        0 define-macro-file utils ascii-time
        define-macro-file format clean sort-lines-ignore-case tabs-to-spaces ...
        define-macro-file cvs cvs cvs-state cvs-update cvs-commit cvs-log ...
        define-macro-file abbrev expand-abbrev-handle expand-iso-accents ...
        define-macro-file misc symbol check-line-length alarm time
        define-macro-file search replace-all-string query-replace-all-string
        define-macro-file tools compile grep rgrep which diff diff-changes
        define-macro-file hkdirlst file-browser file-browser-close
        define-macro-file comment comment-line uncomment-line comment-to-end-of-line
        define-macro-file spell spell-word spell-buffer spell-edit-word find-word
        define-macro-file games Metris Patience Triangle Mahjongg Match-It
        define-macro-file fattrib file-attrib
        define-macro-file osd osd-main
        define-macro-file gdiff
        define-macro-file calc
        define-macro-file draw

```

  Hilighting a number of entries as examples; macro file __calc__ is defined
  with no macro definition, the macro is assumed to be __calc__. The file
  __tools.emf__ contains multiple macros __compile__, __grep__, __diff__ and __diff-changes__;
  all can be defined by a single __define-macro-file__ entry.


## NOTES


  Macro files are searched for in the current directory and along the
  [$search-path(5)]($search-path(5)).
 
  - The macro file is not loaded unless a binding has been defined using
        define-macro-file.
  - Any other macros that exist in the _file-name_ macro file become
        defined when the entry point macro is loaded and are available for
        use. This is potentially useful as a single entry macro may be
        defined using define-macro-file, when invoked other helper macros
        become available.

! 2 scroll-left
! 2 scroll-right
## NAME


|scroll-left
  scroll-left - Move the window left (scrolling)
|scroll-right
  scroll-right - Move the window right (scrolling)
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __scroll-left__ (__C-x <__)  
  _n_ __scroll-right__ (__C-x >__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __scroll-left__ moves the window in current buffer left by 1 screen width. If
  an argument _n_ is supplied then the resolution of movement is specified in
  characters relative to the current displacement. Moving the window in the
  current buffer left by _n_ characters (that is if the current left-hand
  margin of the screen is column 0, the left hand margin becomes column _n_).

  __scroll-right__ moves the window in current buffer right by 1 screen width.
  If an argument _n_ is supplied then the resolution of movement is specified
  in characters relative to the current displacement.

  The ends of the lines of a scrolled screen are delimited with a dollar (__$__)
  character indicating that the text continues. When no scroll is in effect
  the left hand margin of the screen does not show the __$__ symbol. i.e. The
  line `This text is scrolled on this line` with a current scroll offset of 2
  in a 22 column window would appear as follows:

                 22
     |<------------------->|

     |$s text is scrolled $|


  The amount of scroll (_n_) is effectively unlimited, it is possible to
  scroll all of the text in a buffer out of the window, when only __$__'s appear
  in the left margin, in the last highlighting color of the line (blank
  lines always remain blank and are not delimited with a __$__). Text on the
  current line is handled according to the value of [$scroll(5)]($scroll(5)) as follows:

  __$scroll 0__
  
  >  The current line ONLY is scrolled (about the current scroll position)
     to enable the current buffers cursor position to be viewed. To enable
     the user to determine where the current line is in relation to the
     scrolled lines then the first character of the current line is
     interpreted as follows:-

  >  __All of user text appears__

            |$f line of te$|
            |At start of l$|
            |$f line of te$|


  > >       Surrounding lines commence with "$" indicates at the start of the
            line.

  >   __$ in column 0__

            |$f line of te$|
            |$f line of te$|
            |$f line of te$|


  > >       Text column is the same as the surrounding text i.e. the line and
            window scroll are the same.

  >   __> Left of scroll position__

            |$f line of te$|
            |>f line of te$|
            |$f line of te$|


  >         The current line is to the left of the scrolled position.
            [forward-char](forward-char(2)) (i.e. interpret as --> indicating the direction of
            travel) moves the cursor, and therefore the line, towards the
            natural scroll position ($ in column).

     __< Right of scroll position__

            |$f line of te$|
            |<f line of te$|
            |$f line of te$|


   >        The current line is to the right of the scrolled position.
            [backward-char](forward-char(2)) (i.e. interpret as <-- indicating the direction of
            travel) moves the cursor, and therefore the line, towards the
            natural scroll position ($ in column).

  __$scroll 1__
  
  >  The position of the cursor on the line determines the scrolled
     position. In this case all lines in the window are scrolled to ensure
     that the cursor is always visible. This mode is only useful when
     dealing with large blocks of text whose line lengths do not vary.


## NOTES


  The scrolling is an attribute of the WINDOW and not the BUFFER. If the
  window is closed, or contents swapped to a different buffer then the
  scroll setting is reset for the next buffer. A return to the previous
  buffer does not restore the scroll setting. The only case where scrolling
  is inherited is when a window is split (see [split-window-vertically(2)](split-window-vertically(2))).

  When binding __scroll-left__ to the keyboard then it is important to note that
  when no argument is specified the resolution is _frame-width_'s. A key
  binding would operate on character multiples, hence the command should be
  bound with a numeric argument to perform the perform the keyboard action.
  e.g.

```{.emf}
        1 global-bind-key scroll-left  "A-left"
        1 global-bind-key scroll-right "A-right"

```

  To move 5 columns on a key stroke, for an accelerated scroll, then the
  binding may be re-written as:-

```{.emf}
        5 global-bind-key scroll-left  "A-left"
        5 global-bind-key scroll-right "A-right"

```

! 2 save-some-buffers
## NAME


  save-some-buffers - Save contents of all changed buffers to file (with query)
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __save-some-buffers__


## DESCRIPTION


  __save-some-buffers__ cycles through all visible buffers (buffers without mode
  [hide(2m)](hide(2m)) set) and attempts to save all modified ones, writing the contents
  back to the file from where it was read. For each buffer that has been
  modified the user is prompted to save the buffer, the following responses
  can be given:

  __y__
  
  >  Saves the buffer and moves to the next modified buffer.

  __n__
  
  >  Does not save the buffer and moves to the next modified buffer. __a__
     Saves all remaining modified buffers including the current one without
     further prompting. __o__ Skips all remaining buffers including the current
     one. __g__ Display the buffer and aborts the command.

  The argument _n_ can be used to change the default behavior of
  save-some-buffers described above, _n_ is a bit based flag where:-

  __0x01__
  
  >  Enables the user prompt before the buffer is saved (default). If this
     flag is not supplied then all modified visible buffers will be
     written.

## NAME


  split-window-horizontally - Split current window into two (horizontally)
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __split-window-horizontally__ (__C-x 3__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __split-window-horizontally__ splits the current window horizontally into two
  near equal windows, each displaying the buffer displayed by the original
  window.

  A numeric argument _n_ of 1 forces the left window to be the new current
  window, and an argument of 2 forces the right window to be the new current
  window. The default when omitted is the left window.

## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __change-window-width__ [ "_width_" ]

  _n_ __grow-window-horizontally__  
  _n_ __shrink-window-horizontally__  
  _n_ __resize-window-horizontally__


## DESCRIPTION


  __change-window-width__ changes the width of the current window, if the
  numeric argument _n_ is given then the window width is changed by _n_
  characters. If _n_ is not specified the user is prompted for the new _width_
  and the window width will be changed to this value. The command aborts if
  the requested size cannot be achieved (the window becomes too small or a
  neighbouring does).


## EXAMPLE


  Refer to `mouse.emf` for an example of window growth using the mouse to
  manipulate the size of the windows.


## NOTES


  Commands __grow-window-horizontally__, __shrink-window-horizontally__ and
  __resize-window-horizontally__ were replaced by the new __change-window-width__
  command in April 2002. Following are macro implementations of the old
  commands:

```{.emf}
        define-macro grow-window-horizontally
            @# change-window-width
        !emacro

        define-macro shrink-window-horizontally
            &neg @# change-window-width
        !emacro

        define-macro resize-window-horizontally

! 2 resize-all-windows
## NAME


  resize-all-windows - Automatically resize the windows
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __resize-all-windows__


## DESCRIPTION


  __resize-all-windows__ performs an automatic layout of the windows on the
  screen, reorganizing the windows such that each window has an equal amount
  of space. The argument _n_ determines which axes reorganization is performed
  in.

  - A positive argument reorganizes the windows vertically, leaving the
        horizontal arrangement as is.
  - A negative argument rearranges the windows horizontally, leaving the
        vertical arrangement as is.
  - An argument of zero performs no vertical or horizontal arrangement.
  - No argument re-arranges both the vertical and horizontal window
        layout.

! 2 mark-registry
## NAME


  mark-registry - Modify the operating mode of a registry node


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __mark-registry__ "_root_" "_mode_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __mark-registry__ modifies the _mode_ of a registry node _root_. If an argument _n_
  is supplied then the _n_th register node down from __root__ (as viewed from
  [list-registry(2)](list-registry(2)) output) is modified instead. The mode is string
  specifying the modes, each mode is represented by a character. Lower case
  characters add a mode, upper case characters delete a mode. The modes are
  defined as:-

  __?__ - Query Name
  
  >  Returns the full name, including path, of the given registry node in
     the variable [$result(5)]($result(5)). This does not alter the registry.

  __!__ - Hide Value
  
  >  Hides the value of the given registry node, i.e. the node is displayed
     but its value will not be displayed in the output of [list-registry(2)](list-registry(2)).
     Once set, this mode cannot be removed.

  __a__ - Autosave
  
  >  Automatically saves the registry when it is deleted or unloaded from
     the registry. The user is not prompted for a save.

  __b__ - Backup
  
  >  Automatically performs a backup of the registry file whenever a save
     operation is performed.

  __c__ - Create
  
  >  If the registry file cannot be loaded then the _root_ node is created
     and the invocation succeeds. If this mode is omitted then the call
     fails if the _file_ cannot be found.

  __d__ - Discard
  
  >  Marks the registry as discardable. This is typically used for
     registries that are not saved.

  __f__ - File
  
  >  The registry node is marked as a file root, the value must be set to
     the registry file name.

  __g__ - Get Modes
  
  >  Returns the list of modes currently set on the given registry node in
     the variable [$result(5)]($result(5)). This does not alter the registry.

  __h__ - Hierarchy Hidden
  
  >  The registry node is marked as _Hidden_, i.e. its children will not be
     shown in [list-registry(2)](list-registry(2)) output. A node is marked has hidden when it
     is folded up.

  __i__ - Invisible
  
  >  The registry node is not displayed in the [list-registry(2)](list-registry(2)) output.

  __m__ - Merge
  
  >  Marks the registry to enable merging, see [read-registry(2)](read-registry(2)).

  __r__ - Reload
  
  >  Marks the registry to enable reload, see [read-registry(2)](read-registry(2)).

  __u__ - Updated
  
  >  Marks the registry as modified. The modified bit is removed when the
     registry file is saved. If the modified bit is applied to a registry
     node the user will be prompted to save the registry when it is deleted
     (or it will be automatically saved when the _Autosave_ mode is used).

  __y__ - Encryption
  
  >  Marks the registry node for encryption. The value of the registry node
     is encrypted using the internal encryption algorithm. The value will
     not appear in plain text when using [save-registry(2)](save-registry(2)). This is
     typically used for password information etc.

  Multiple modes may be applied.


## EXAMPLE


  A history registry can be hidden with the following invocation:-

```{.emf}
        mark-registry "/history" "h"

```
  It could then be made visible again using:-
```{.emf}
        mark-registry "/history" "H"

```

## BUGS


  At exit only registry nodes attached to the root are saved.


## DIAGNOSTICS


  __mark-registry__ fails if _root_ does not exist.

! 2 delete-some-buffers
## NAME


  delete-some-buffers - Delete buffers with query
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __delete-some-buffers__


## DESCRIPTION


  __delete-some-buffers__ cycles through all visible buffers (buffers without
  mode [hide(2m)](hide(2m)) set) and prompts the user [__y__/__n__] as to whether the buffer
  should be deleted. A __y__ response deletes the buffer, a __n__ response retains
  the buffer.

  If a __y__ response is given, the buffer has been edited, and its name does
  not start with a '__*__' then the user is prompted as to whether the changes
  should be discarded. Also if the buffer has an active process running in
  it then confirmation is sort from the user before the process is killed.

  The argument _n_ can be used to change the default behavior of
  delete-some-buffers described above, _n_ is a bit based flag where:-

  __0x01__
  
  >  Enables all checks (default). These include the initial y/n prompt on
     each buffer, the buffer has not been modified check, if so the user is
     prompted. Also if a process is running then user must confirm that the
     process can be killed. If this flag is not supplied then all visible
     buffers are killed without any user prompts (useful in macros).

## NAME


  read-registry - Read in a registry definition file
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __read-registry__ "_root_" "_file_" "_mode_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __read-registry__ loads a registry file [erf(8)](erf(8)) into the internal registry
  memory, where the information may be queried via the registry macro
  commands. The arguments are defined as follows:-

  _root_
  
  >  The root node in the registry to into which the registry contents are
     attached. The root name is limited to 32 characters in length and is
     specified without a leading forward slash '`/`'. The node _root_ is
     created at the root of the registry.

  _file_
  
  >  The name of the registry file [erf(8)](erf(8)) to load. This may be an absolute,
     relative or a [$search-path(5)]($search-path(5)) specified file; typically it is located
     on [$search-path]($search-path(5)).

  _mode_
  
  >  The _mode_ is string specifying the registry node loading and saving
     modes, each mode is represented by a character. Lower case characters
     add a mode, upper case characters delete a mode. The modes are defined
     as follows:-

  >  __a__ - Autosave

  > >       Automatically saves the registry when it is deleted or unloaded
            from the registry. The user is not prompted for a save.

  >  __b__ - Backup

  > >       Automatically performs a backup of the registry file whenever a
            save operation is performed.

  >  __c__ - Create
   
  > >       If the registry file cannot be loaded then the root node is
            created and the invocation succeeds. If this mode is omitted then
            the call fails if the file cannot be found.

  >  __d__ - Discard
   
  > >       Marks the registry as discardable. This is typically used for
            registries that are not saved.

  >  __r__ - Reload
  
  > >       If the registry node already exists then it is deleted and
            reloaded, see also the merge flag (m). By default, when both the r
            and m flags are omitted and the registry node already exists the
            read operation is not performed and the existing node is used.

  >  __m__ - Merge
   
  > >       The registry file is merged with the contents of any existing
            registry node. (i.e. the existing registry tree nodes are not
            deleted if they already exist). See also the reload flag (r).

  >  __h__ - Hidden

  > >       The registry node is created in the Hidden state. (i.e. children
            will not be shown in [list-registry(2)](list-registry(2)) output). Refer to
            [mark-registry(2)](mark-registry(2)) for hiding modes.

  >  __u__ - Updated

  > >       Marks the registry as modified. The modified bit is removed when
            the registry file is saved. If the modified bit is applied to a
            registry node the user will be prompted to save the registry when
            it is deleted (or it will be automatically saved when the Autosave
            mode is used).

  >  Multiple modes may be applied.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example is a typical call made from a macro using a registry
  file where the user may edit the registry file. In this case this a reload
  of the registry is forced to ensure that the most up-to-date contents are
  retrieved. Note that the name of the registry file is actually retrieved
  from the _history_ registry.

```{.emf}
        set-variable #l1 &reg "/history/address" $user-name
        !if &seq &set #l0 &find #l1 ".ab" "ERROR"
            set-variable #l0 &reg "/history" ""
            set-variable #l0 &spr "%s%s.ab" &lef #l0 &rsin "/" #l0 #l1
        !endif
        read-registry "AddressBook" #l0 "rc"

```

## BUGS

! 2 file-op
## NAME


  file-op - File system operations command
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __file-op__ [ ( [ "_from-file_" "_to-file_" ] ) |  
     ( ["_delete-file_"] ) | ( ["_dir-name_"] ) |
     ( [ "_chmod-file_" "_mode_" ] ) ]


## DESCRIPTION


  __file-op__ can be used to perform numerous file system operations. The given
  argument _n_ must be used to determine the required operation, the value is
  a bit based flag denoting the operation as follows:

  __0x010__
  
  >  Log-off and close down the current ftp connect (not a file system
     operation but functionality was required and it had to go somewhere).

  __0x020__
  
  >  When this bit is set the command functionality is changed to
     delete-file, the single argument _delete-file_ is deleted. Note this can
     also delete a directory if the directory is empty.

  __0x040__
  
  >  When this bit is set the command functionality is changed to
     move-file, the specified _from-file_ is moved to _to-file_.

  __0x080__
  
  >  When this bit is set the command functionality is changed to
     copy-file, the specified _from-file_ is copied to _to-file_.

  __0x100__
  
  >  When this bit is set the command functionality is changed to making a
     new directory, the specified _dir-name_ is the name of the new
     directory. A file or directory of the given name must not already
     exist.

  __0x200__
  
  >  When this bit is set the command functionality is changed to a change
     mode type of operation. _chmod-file_ is the name of the file (or
     directory) to change and _mode_ is the integer mode to apply. Note that
     the _mode_ value is operating system specific. The file attributes may
     be retrieved with the [&stat(4)](&stat(4)) command.

  Only one operation can be performed per invocation. The following bits in
  the given argument _n_ can be used to effect the behaviour of these
  operations:

  __0x01__
  
  >  Enables validity checks, these include a check that the proposed file
     does not already exist, if so confirmation of writing is requested
     from the user. Also MicroEmacs checks all other current buffers for
     one with the proposed file name, if found, again confirmation is
     requested. Without this flag the command will always succeed wherever
     possible.

  __0x02__
  
  >  Creates a backup of any file about to be deleted or over-written. Set
     help on [$buffer-backup(5)]($buffer-backup(5)) for backup file-name generation.

  __0x04__
  
  >  When validity checks are enabled (see bit 0x01 above) and this bit is
     set, if a problem is found the command aborts rather than prompting
     the user. Also see the error return codes in the notes section below.

  __0x80__
  
  >  When this bit is set then the files time stamp is preserved.


## NOTES


  __http__ files are not supported except as the source file when copying. __ftp__
  files are fully supported with the restriction that the from and to files
  cannot both be url (http or ftp) files. The one exception to this is when
  moving a file on the same ftp site in which case ME will attempt to use an
  ftp rename command.

  The command is used by [file-browser(3)](file-browser(3)) and [ftp(3)](ftp(3)) which provides an easy
  to use interfaces for file manipulation.

  When the command fails an error code is returned in the [$result(5)]($result(5))
  variable, which will be one of the following:

  __0__
  
  >  User aborted.

  __1__
  
  >  General error.

  __2__
  
  >  Failure due to a read error.

  __3__
  
  >  Failure due to a write error.

  __4__
  
  >  Failure due to a directory creation error.

  __5__
  
  >  Failure due to a file or directory deletion error.

  __6__
  
  >  Failure due to file write checks, i.e. file already exists etc.

  __7__
  
  >  Failure due to directory creation checks, i.e. the directory or file
     already exists.

  __8__
  
  >  Failure due to file delete checks, i.e. file is read only.

  __9__
  
  >  Failure due to source and destination files are URLs.

! 2 kill-rectangle
! 2 yank-rectangle
## NAME


|kill-rectangle
  kill-rectangle - Delete a column of text
|yank-rectangle
  yank-rectangle - Insert a column of text
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __kill-rectangle__ (__esc C-w__)  
  _n_ __yank-rectangle__ (__esc C-y__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __kill-rectangle__ deletes a rectangle (or column) of text defined between the
  cursor and the [set-mark](set-mark(2)) position. The text between the mark column and the
  cursor column is removed from every line between the mark line and the
  cursor line inclusive and copied to the kill buffer. The delete text may
  then be extracted from the kill buffer using [yank(2)](yank(2)), __yank-rectangle__ or
  [yank-rectangle-overwrite(3)](yank-rectangle-overwrite(3)).

  The mark position may be ahead or behind the current cursor position. If
  the rectangle column boundary divides a tab character which spans multiple
  columns, the tab character is replaced with the equivalent number of
  spaces. Similarly if the boundary divides an unprintable character which
  is displayed using multiple characters (e.g. '`^A`' for character 0x01) then
  spaces are inserted before the character to move it to the right of the
  boundary.

  __yank-rectangle__ inserts the current kill buffer (which may or may not have
  been generated using __kill-rectangle__) into the current buffer in a column
  fashion. That is to say that the first line of text in the kill buffer is
  inserted into the current line of text in the current buffer from the
  current cursor column, the cursor is then moved the the next line and
  placed at the same column. The process is then repeated for the second
  line of text in the kill buffer etc.

! 2 command-wait
## NAME


  command-wait - Conditional wait command
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __command-wait__


## DESCRIPTION


  When a positive argument _n_ is given __command-wait__ waits for _n_ milliseconds
  before returning, this wait cannot be interrupted. If a negative argument
  is given, __command-wait__ waits for -_n_ milliseconds but the command will
  return if the user interrupts with any input activity (i.e. presses a
  key).

  When no argument or an argument of 0 is given __command-wait__ waits until
  either the calling command's __.wait__ command variable is undefined or it is
  set to false (`0`). When no argument is given events such as user input,
  screen updates etc. are still processed, this interface is best used when
  a main macro must wait and process input until an exit criteria has been
  met, the user input is best processed by setting the [$buffer-input(5)]($buffer-input(5))
  variable to a second macro. The macro [gdiff(3)](gdiff(3)) uses this command in this
  way, also see a comprehensive example below.

  When no argument is given user input and screen update events are ignored,
  this is typically used when MicroEmacs is used in pipe mode, see option __-p__
  of [me(1)](me(1)), see the example below.


## EXAMPLE


  The following macro code will display a message on the screen for a fixed
  5 seconds:

```{.emf}
        16 screen-poke 10 10 0 "Hello World!"
        5000 command-wait

```

  Similarly the following macro code will display a message for up to 5
  seconds or till the user presses a key:

```{.emf}
        16 screen-poke 10 10 0 "Hello World!"
        -5000 command-wait

```

  The following example shows how command-wait can be used to run a system
  process making MicroEmacs wait until the process has completed before
  continuing, yet giving feedback from the process to the user and allowing
  the user to kill the launched process. The process run is a recursive
  directory listing which will take a long time and give a lot of feed back,
  to kill the process with a prompt use delete-buffer (bound to '`C-x k`') or
  use abort-command (bound to '__C-g__') to kill immediately:

```{.emf}
        0 define-macro test-ipipe-macro
            ; add extra macro code to process output here
            !if &not @#
                ; the process has finished
                set-variable .test.wait 0

        !emacro

            !elif &seq @cck "callback"
                !force execute-named-command @cc

                !endif

                !force ipipe-kill
                set-variable .test.wait 0
            !endif
        !emacro

        define-macro test
            set-variable #l0 &con &band $system 0x100 "dir /s c:\\" "ls -R /"
            set-variable .wait 1
            !force !force !force 0x82 ipipe-shell-command #l0 "*test*" test-ipipe-macro

            !if &band #l1 1
                !force 0 delete-buffer "*cc-cmdline*"
            !endif
            find-buffer "*test*"
            set-variable $buffer-input test-input-macro
            !force !force !force command-wait
            set-variable $buffer-input ""
            ml-write "[test complete]"
        !emacro

```

  The following macro code demonstrates how MicroEmacs can be used as a
  command-line tool, piping the output of another sub-process as it goes. In
  this example MicroEmacs executes a system directory listing command and
  prints the output to stdout using ml-write.

```{.emf}
        ml-write "Loading pipetest.emf"

        define-macro pipetest-ipipe
            !if &not @#
                end-of-buffer
            !else
                goto-alpha-mark "I"
            !endif
            ml-write &spr "In pipetest-ipipe %d %d %d" @# .line $window-line
            set-variable #l0 $window-line
            set-variable $window-line .line
            !while &les $window-line #l0
                -1 ml-write @wl
                forward-line
            !done
            set-variable .line $window-line
            !if &not @#
                -2 ml-write "Process finished"
                set-variable .start-up.wait 0
            !endif
        !emacro


        define-macro start-up
            ml-write "Got into start-up"
            set-variable .wait 1
            set-variable .pipetest-ipipe.line 1
            set-variable #l0 &con &band $system 0x100 "dir" "ls -l"
            -2 ml-write &cat "About to execute: " #l0
            0xc0 ipipe-shell-command #l0 "*test*" pipetest-ipipe
            0 command-wait
            ml-write "start-up continues"
            exit-emacs
        !emacro

        ml-write "Loading pipetest.emf complete"

```

  To run this example, save the above macro code to `pipetest.emf` and then
  run:

  >  __me -n -p @pipetest.emf__

  Use the __-P__ option for additional debug lines, printed to stderr. Windows
  users must use a console capable version of MicroEmacs, i.e. mec32.exe or
  mecw32.exe.

! 2 create-frame
## NAME


  create-frame - Create a new frame
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __create-frame__ (__C-x 5 1__, __C-x 5 2__)


## INTODUCTION


  A __frame__ in MicroEmacs is the screen canvas on which all of the windows are
  attached. MicroEmacs allows the creation of new frames, creating a new
  blank canvas, which may be populated with new windows. Frames may be
  swapped and the window layout for a given frame is preserved until the
  frame is displayed again. There are two types of frame:

  Internal
 
  >  An internal frame uses the same display window (or console) hiding any
     other frames. On creation, any existing frame is hidden and a new
     frame blank takes its place. Internal frames are supported on all
     platforms.

  External
 
  >  An external frame creates a new display window allowing both the
     original frame and new frame to be visible in different windows.
     External frames are only available on windowing platforms such as
     X-Windows and Microsoft Windows. External frames may include internal
     frames which are paged.

  This is shown in the following diagram:-

                 +-----------------+           +-----------------+
                 |                 +-+         |                 +-+
                 |                 | +-+       |                 | |
                 |                 | | |       |                 | |
                 |                 | | |       |                 | |
                 +-+---------------+ | |       +-+---------------+ |
                   +-+---------------+ |         +-----------------+
                     +-----------------+

                  Three Internal Frames        External Frame with
                                               two internal frames


  The user may move to the next frame using [next-frame(2)](next-frame(2)) which swaps the
  current frame for the next frame. External frames may also be accessed via
  the window manager by selecting the window.

  A frame may be subsequently deleted with [delete-frame(2)](delete-frame(2)).


## DESCRIPTION


  __create-frame__ creates a new frame for the current MicroEmacs session, the
  new frame is assigned a unique identity [$frame-id(5)]($frame-id(5)) which exists for the
  life of the frame.

  The numeric argument _n_ defines the type of frame to be created. An
  argument of `2` creates an external frame, an internal frame is created with
  an argument of `1`. Where no argument is specified an external frame is
  created by default on systems which support them otherwise an internal
  frame is created.


## NOTES


  MicroEmacs is not multi-threaded and only one frame may be active at any
  one time (the complexity of being able to run a command in one frame while
  editing in another would rapidly lead it away from the 'Micro' status).
  Therefore if a command is left active (such as a search) in one frame and
  the focus is changed to another frame the input is _sent_ to the frame with
  the active command and the message `[NOT FOCUS]` appears in the message-line
  of the frame with the focus.

  __create-frame__ is useful in macros that rely on a window layout, as the
  macro can preserve the users current window layout by creating a new
  internal frame in which to run.

## NAME


  next-frame - Change the focus to the next frame
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __next-frame__ (__C-x 5 o__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __next-frame__ changes the focus to the next frame. The numerical argument _n_
  can be used to select the type of frame to change to, it is a bit based
  flag defined as follows:

  __0x01__
  
  >  Allow the selection of an internal frame.

  __0x02__
  
  >  Allow the selection of an external frame.

  The default operation when _n_ is omitted is to allow the selection of
  either type of frame, but an external frame is selected in preference.
  This is not the same as giving the command an argument of `3` where all
  frames are circled in creation order (i.e. no priority given to an
  internal or external frame).

! 2 Compatibility
## COMPATIBILITY


  JASSPA MicroEmacs is based on the original version of __MicroEMACS__ produced
  by Danial Lawrence at revision 3.8, the source files were obtained in
  approximately 1990. The exact origin of the files is unknown. In that
  period of time the source files have undergone an awful lot of change,
  without reference to the subsequent releases made of MicroEMACS by Danial
  Lawrence (due to no network access). As a result the JASSPA version of
  __MicroEmacs__ does not include any modifications or features that may have
  been implemented since. This version of __MicroEmacs__ has been tailored to
  suite the requirements of a small group of individuals who have used the
  editor on a daily basis across a limited number of platforms, for a
  variety of very different tasks and operating requirements.

  This version of MicroEmacs is biased towards UNIX environments, MS-DOS and
  Microsoft Windows ports have been performed however they are heavily
  influenced by UNIX and inherit UNIX characteristics wherever possible. The
  intention is that programmers, and alike, may move across platforms using
  a common editor environment without being frustrated by the idiosyncrasies
  of different platforms. The most noticeable platform is the Microsoft
  Windows platform which mimics the X-Windows cut and paste mechanism within
  the MicroEmacs environment. If you want a Windows style environment then
  use __Notepad(1)__ or __Wordpad(1)__, this editor is not for you !!

  The gross changes to __MicroEmacs 2009__ are summarized as follows:-

  - Macro language interpreter re-written allowing an unlimited number
   of named macros to be supported. The macro implementation allows new
   commands to be created by the user, as opposed to continually
   extending the underlying command set. The named macros are
   transparent to the user, appearing as built in commands on the
   command line. Macro command set significantly increased. Support for
   global, buffer and register variables within the macro language.

  - Display drivers re-written providing color hilighting support on
   most platforms. A macro interface allows information to be written
   directly to the display canvas allowing the screen to be annotated
   with additional transient information.

  - Support for X-Window screen type in UNIX environments. Microsoft
   Window's environments (3.x, '95, NT) treated in the same was as
   X-Windows - this may be unorthodox for existing Window's users, UNIX
   users will find it more comfortable.

  - Introduction of integrated spell checker. Support includes
   correction word guessing, word auto-correction and double word
   detection. Ignore and personal dictionaries supported.

  - Horizontal window splitting.

  - Introduction of scroll bars on all platforms that support a mouse.
   The scroll bar implementation is platform independent.

  - Command and file completion available on all platforms. Most
   commands support a command history allowing previous command
   invocations to be recalled.

  - Session history file kept, allowing the previous edit session to be
   reinstated.

  - Undo capability, allows previous edits to be undone when mistakes
   are made.

  - Backup capability, Includes a periodic timed backup while an editing
   session is in progress. The timed backup is automatically recovered
   by the next session in situations where the system (or editor)
   crashes.

  - A regular expression incremental search becomes the default search
   forward mechanism.

  - Support for abbreviation files allowing frequently used constructs
   to be automatically expanded.

  - Automatic time stamping of files, allowing the edit time to be
   automatically maintained in the source file(s).

  - Introduction of an electric 'C' mode. Editor intelligently handles
   the layout of 'C' files (under user control).

  - Improved documentation text mode providing left/right/center and
   both justification methods with inclusion for bullet points.
   Automatic justification may be continually performed as text is
   entered, thereby maintaining the paragraph in the correct format.

  - Integrated on-line help facilities. All commands are documented
   on-line. New macros may be documented within the macro files and
   become part of the help system.

  - File type determination system, based on either the file name or
   embedded file text allows file type specific macros (hooks) to be
   applied, thereby configuring the editor into the correct mode for
   the file type.

  - Introduction of special MicroEmacs search path allowing all of the
   standard configuration files to be utilized from a shared directory.

  The name space of JASSPA MicroEmacs differs from the original MicroEMACS
  and has become more compliant with the GNU implementation of Emacs. A list
  of the original MicroEMACS verses the new command name set is as follows,
  executing the compatibility macro file `meme3_8.emf` will create macro

! 2 fileHooks
## FILE HOOKS


  File hooks provide a mechanism to automatically invoke a set of macros for
  a given buffer type when the following events occur:

  - Loading of a file into a buffer
  - Moving into a buffer (i.e. making a buffer current)
  - Moving out of a buffer (i.e. making another buffer current)
  - Deleting an active buffer

  The file hook selection (see below) is performed on the file name /
  extension and on the textual content of the buffer using [add-file-hook](add-file-hook(2)).

  Refer to [Language Templates](languageTemplates(2)) for a description of how the file hooks are
  used to define a new template for a new text format.

  The hook macros allow buffer modes and highlighting, applicable to the
  text type of the file, to be applied to the buffer. In addition, the
  associated hook macros may be located in a separate file and are loaded on
  demand when the file reading determines that a set of hook macros are
  required.

  Consider a file hook definition of the form;

```{.emf}
        add-file-hook ".c .h" "fhook-c"

```

  which binds the file hook __fhook-c__ to any files that are loaded with the
  extension __.c__ and __.h__. The operations undertaken by MicroEmacs 2009 are
  defined as follows when a file `foo.c` is loaded:-

  - Attempt to load file `foo.c`, if `foo.c` is not found then create a new
        buffer and assign file name foo.c.

  - If `foo.c` is found then load file into buffer. Search the first
        line(s) of the buffer for magic hook text (add-file-hook with
        argument).

  - If magic hook was not found then determine hook name from the file
        extension (add-file-hook information).

  - If a hook command is located, assign the file hook __fhook-c__ to the
        buffer, assign the buffer entry (begin) hook macro of bhook-c;
        assign a buffer exit hook of ehook-c.

  - If the macro __fhook-c__ is undefined then execute the macro file
        hkc.emf from the MicroEmacs home directory in an attempt to load the
        macro. If the file myc.emf is defined, then the modifications to the
        language template are applied after hkc.emf is loaded.

  - If the macro __fhook-c__ is (now) defined then `foo.c` is TEMPORARILY made
        the current buffer and the file hook macro fhook-c is executed to
        completion and the previous current buffer is restored. [TEMPORARY
        here implies that no buffer hooks are executed on the flip in/out of
        foo.c].

  - The current buffer is officially swapped to `foo.c`. At this point the
        ehook of the old current buffer is executed (while its still
        current) and then foo.c is swapped in to become the current buffer;
        the begin buffer hook bhook-cmode is then executed for foo.c (if it
        exists).

  - If the user moves to another buffer execute the end hook macro
        ehook-cmode (if it exists) and move to the new buffer, executing
        it's begin hook.

  - If the user subsequently returns to buffer `foo.c` execute the
        previous buffers end hook macro, set the current buffer to foo.c and
        execute the begin hook macro bhook-c (if it exists).

  - If the user kills buffer `foo.c`, if `foo.c` is the current buffer then
        an alternative buffer is made current, ehook and bhook executed as
        normal. If macro dhook-c is defined then foo.c is TEMPORARILY made
        the current buffer and the delete hook macro dhook-c is executed to
        completion and the previous current buffer is restored.

  The name of the file hook macro name is important, hook commands must
  commence with the text __fhook-mode__ where _mode_ is an identifier for the
  operating mode. The name space is decomposed as follows:-

  - The initial __f__ is removed and replaced with __b__ for the begin hook
        macro and e for the end hook macro.

  - When the __fhook__ macro is undefined the _mode_ component is removed and
        the file hkmode.emf is executed from the MicroEmacs home directory
        in an attempt to define the macro.

  The __fhook-__ nomenclature may be omitted provided that the name is less than
  6 characters, however the file, begin and end hook macros MUST commence
  with __f__, __b__ and __e__ respectively. In addition the macros must be defined as no
  auto file loading is performed.


## Buffer Hook Variables 


  The macros bound to a buffer may be interrogated, the variables
  [$buffer-fhook(5)]($buffer-fhook(5)), [$buffer-bhook(5)]($buffer-bhook(5)), [$buffer-ehook(5)]($buffer-ehook(5)) and [$buffer-dhook(5)]($buffer-dhook(5))
  contain the names of any associated macro attached as a macro hooks,
  defining the _file_, _begin_, _end_ and _delete_ hooks respectively. If a macro is
  not bound then the empty string `""` is returned. Setting the variables has
  the effect of defining the hook and is a method by which the buffer hooks
  may be affected after the buffer has been loaded.


## Determination of a new file 


  The _file_ hook __fhook-XXX__ numeric argument may be used to determine if the
  file associated with a buffer is a new file created by the user, or an
  existing file. Typically this distinction is used to determine whether a
  boiler template is added to the file or not. The macro argument __@#__ is
  defined as zero (0) if this is a new file that has been created, or
  non-zero otherwise.

  The macro argument status is typically tested on entry to the macro as
  follows:-

```{.emf}
        define-macro fhook-mode
            !if &not @#
                ; This is a new file. Do new file things
            !else
                ; This is an existing file
            !endif
            ; Set up bindings
        !emacro

```

  An example of a generic __hook__ file is given at the end of this section
  which elaborates on the file hooks.


## Begin and End hooks 


  The _begin_ and _end_ hooks are usually used to save and restore global states
  which require special settings for a particular buffer type. This
  typically involves saving and restoring global variables which are used by
  other buffers in a different configuration. For example the following is
  used to reformat the time stamp string; the time stamp is a global
  variable [$timestamp(5)]($timestamp(5)) and if it is changed in one buffer, it must be
  restored ready for another. In this case the old time stamp is retained in
  a local buffer variable whenever the buffer is entered, the time stamp is
  then modified for the buffers requirements. On exit from the buffer the
  old time stamp format is restored to it's former state.

```{.emf}
        0 define-macro bhook-foo
            set-variable .timestamp $timestamp      ; Save old time stamp.
            set-variable $timestamp "19%Y/%M/%D %h:%m:%s"
        !emacro

        0 define-macro ehook-foo
            set-variable $timestamp .bhook-foo.timestamp
        !emacro

```

  Note that in both cases the [define-macro(2)](define-macro(2)) invocation is defined as zero,
  this merely hides the macro from the command line since both are private
  macros not normally invoked by the user.


## FILE HOOK SELECTION


  MicroEmacs 2009 may be reconfigured to operate in different modes
  (referred to a _Major Modes_ in GNU __emacs(1)__) using the [macro file hooks](add-file-hook(2)).
  The file hooks allow the working environment to be customized for the
  editing of text of a particular sort, by importing text specific macros,
  key rebinding and highlighting.

  MicroEmacs 2009, by default, loads a file into a buffer with default
  global modes with no highlighting. There are no mode specific key
  bindings, variable settings, macros or highlights, buffer interaction
  behaves in it's default state. The state of the buffer interaction may be
  modified through the use of the buffer modes (see [Operating Modes](Operating Modes)), for
  example the 'C' programming language automatic indent [indent(2)](indent(2)) changes
  the characteristics of the `tab` character and performs language specific
  indentation of statements. When a text specific set of highlighting rules
  are applied to the buffer, the text becomes emphasized through the use of
  color applied selectively to the text i.e. comments, keywords, strings are
  shown in different colors, allowing them to be differentiated without
  studying the content.

  Setting the operating mode of the buffer would be tedious to perform from
  the command line, instead MicroEmacs 2009 uses three different prioritized
  criteria to endeavor to select the correct operating mode. The operating
  mode is applied to the buffer by execution of a set of file specific
  macros, referred to a hook commands. The selection criteria of the hook
  commands is performed as follows, ordered in lowest to highest priority:-

  __File Name__
  
  >  MicroEmacs 2009 uses the filename and/or the file extension to select
     a start-up hook command. File names and extensions are bound to a set
     of macro hooks in a space separated list e.g.

     >  [add-file-hook](add-file-hook(2)) "c cpp" "fhook-cmode"  
        [add-file-hook](add-file-hook(2)) "doc txt README" "fhook-doc"

  >  The space separated list of names are interpreted as either file
     extensions or filenames. In this case any file with the extension __.c__,
     __.cpp__ is bound to a file hook called __fhook-cmode__ e.g. `foo.c`. Similarly
     files with the extension __.doc__ or __.txt__ are interpreted as plain text
     documents and are bound to __fhook-doc__. e.g. `foo.txt`. The entry __README__
     that exists in the documentation hook list may refer to a file `README`
     and also `foo.README`, both cases invoke the document hook.

  >  The file selection is the lowest priority selection criteria but
     usually satisfies most mode selection requirements.

  __Magic Strings__
  
  >  There are cases when file extensions may be omitted from files,
     typically these files include an identifier, or magic string, on the
     first line of the file which is used to identify the file to the
     operating system or application e.g. shell scripts under UNIX.
     MicroEmacs 2009 automatically interrogates the top of every file that
     is loaded to locate some form of identification string. The
     identification strings are defined in a similar way to the file name
     hooks, except instead of defining a file extension the location and
     text content of the identifier is defined:

     >  1 [add-file-hook](add-file-hook(2)) "#!/bin/sh" "fhook-shell"  
        1 [add-file-hook](add-file-hook(2)) "#!/usr/local/bin/wish" "fhook-tcl"

  >  In this case, any file that commences with "__#!/bin/sh__" is interpreted
     as a shell script and invokes the shell hook __fhook-shell__. Where the
     identifier does not appear on the first non-blank line, the argument
     may be increased to the number of lines to be searched. Also it the
     magic sting should be search for without [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) mode then the
     argument should be negated, e.g.

        -4 add-file-hook "<html>" "fhook-html"

  >  invokes __fhook-html__ whenever "`<html>`", "`<HTML>`" etc. is found in the
     first 4 lines of a file header, e.g.:

            <!-- Comment line -->
            <HtMl>


  >  A match on a string identifier is assigned a higher priority than the
     file extension. It is recommended that magic strings are only used
     where there are no predefined file extensions, or conflicts exist
     between files with the same extension containing data interpreted in a
     different context.

  __Explicit Strings__

  >  The last method allows an explicit identifier string to be embedded
     into the text of the file informing MicroEmacs 2009 which mode it
     should adopt. GNU Emacs supports this (see __Major Mode__ in the GNU Emacs
     documentation) type of operation by insertion of strings of the form:

            -*- mode -*-

  >  Where _mode_ represents the major mode within GNU Emacs. The same format
     as used by __Magic Strings__ can be used to find and extract the _mode_,
     e.g.:

            -1 [add-file-hook](add-file-hook(2)) "-[*!]-[ \t]nroff.*-[*!]-" "fhook-nroff"

  >  The definition would detect the GNU Emacs mode defined in an Nroff
     file e.g.

            .\" -*- nroff -*- "
            .TH man 1
            .SH NAME
            ...

  >  It should be stressed that the __-*-__ syntax belongs to GNU Emacs and NOT
     MicroEmacs 2009, MicroEmacs 2009 provides a mechanism to locate,
     extract and interpret the string. The __-*-__ syntax should only be
     applied to files if it is known that the _mode_ is a GNU mode.

  >  A MicroEmacs 2009 specific string is also provided, defined as:

            -!- mode -!-

  >  where _mode_ is an arbitrary string defined by _add-file-hook_. User
     defined modes may be created and assigned to files with this syntax,
     this does not conflict with the GNU Emacs command. For example to
     assign a new mode _mymode_ to a file we would define the following:-

            -1 [add-file-hook](add-file-hook(2)) "-!-[ \t]mymode.*-!-" "fhook-mymode"

  >  Files containing a the following identifier would be loaded with
     _mymode_ hook:

            # -!- mymode -!-
            #
            # Last Modified:  <120683.1014>


## FILE HOOK SCRIPTS


  The buffer hook files __hkXXX.emf__ typically follow a standard layout, and
  are generally associated with hi-lighting as follows, __mode__ in this case is
  the name of the file mode associated with the file:-

```{.emf}
        !if &seq .hilight.mode "ERROR"
            set-variable .hilight.mode &pinc .hilight.next 1
        !endif
        ;
        ; Define the hilighting
        ;
        0 hilight .hilight.mode 1                $global-scheme
        hilight .hilight.mode 2 "\*\*"           .scheme.comment
        hilight .hilight.mode 4 "\"" "\"" "\\"   .scheme.string
        hilight .hilight.mode 0 "'.'"            .scheme.quote

        hilight .hilight.mode 1 "if"             .scheme.keyword
        hilight .hilight.mode 1 "elif"           .scheme.keyword
        hilight .hilight.mode 1 "else"           .scheme.keyword
        ...

        ; Reset the hilighting printer format and define the color bindings.
        0 hilight-print .hilight.mode
        hilight-print .hilight.mode "i"  .scheme.comment
        hilight-print .hilight.mode "b"  .scheme.keyword .scheme.variable
        hilight-print .hilight.mode "bi" .scheme.string .scheme.quote
        ...

        ; Define the indentation tokens
        0 indent  .hilight.mode 2 10
        indent .hilight.mode n "if" 4
        indent .hilight.mode s "elif" -4
        indent .hilight.mode s "else" -4
        indent .hilight.mode o "endif" -4
        indent .hilight.mode n "while" 4
        ...

        define-macro fhook-mode
            ; if arg is 0 this is a new file so add template
            !if &not @#
                etfinsrt "mode"
            !endif
            set-variable $buffer-hilight .hilight.mode
            set-variable $buffer-indent .hilight.mode
            1 buffer-mode "time"
            1 buffer-mode "indent"
            buffer-abbrev-file "mode"
        !emacro

```

  The previous example shows how the __fhook-mode__ numeric argument is used to
  determine if this is a new file. If the argument __@#__ is zero then this is
  interpreted as a new file, in this case a standard template is inserted
  (from file __mode.etf__) and the generic strings such as `$YEAR$` replaced with
  construction information. The template is generally used for standard
  headers and skeleton text body.

  In addition an abbreviation file __mode.eaf__ (see [eaf(8)](eaf(8))) is bound to the
  buffer using the [buffer-abbrev-file(2)](buffer-abbrev-file(2)) command and the buffer hi-lighting
  enabled by assignment of the [$buffer-hilight(5)]($buffer-hilight(5)) variable.


## MODIFYING FILE HOOKS


  The standard hook files supplied with MicroEmacs 2009 should not be
  modified, changes to the file hooks may be applied using a separate macro
  file called __myXXX.emf__, this is automatically executed after the __hkXXX.emf__
  file is executed.

  The extended hook functions may be defined company wide, or by the user,
  to over-ride some of the standard hook functions, or to extend the syntax
  of the base files with locally defined extensions. As an example, consider
  the following file __myc.emf__ which extends the basic __hkc.emf__ file set of
  hi-lighting tokens for the 'C' Language.

## KEY BINDING NAMES


  Every key which can be generated in MicroEmacs 2009 has a character string
  or name representation which can be used to bind and unbind the key to a
  command. The name of simple keys like "`a`" or "`$`" is simply the character,
  i.e. "`a`" and "`$`". Following is a list of other parts to a key name.


## Modify Keys 


  There are 3 modifying keys, Shift, Control and Alt, these are represented
  as "`S-`", "`C-`", "`A-`" respectively. For example the key "`A-C-S-up`" is
  generated when the up cursor key is pressed when Shift, Control and Alt
  keys where also pressed.

  The Control and Alt modifiers are case insensitive so `C-a` is the same as
  `C-A` and `C-S-a`.


## Prefix Keys 


  Many binding are single stroke key sequences (e.g. "`C-a`" =>
  beginning-of-line). However MicroEmacs 2009 has a [prefix(2)](prefix(2)) command which
  can be used to bind up to 8 single stroke keys, turning them into two
  stroke keys; this greatly increasing the number of available bindable key
  sequences. For example __prefix 1__ is bound to the escape character (`esc`),
  this allows key sequences like "`esc a`" to be used. Following is a list of
  prefixes and their default bindings

  - [prefix 1](prefix(2)) => esc
  - [prefix 2](prefix(2)) => C-x
  - [prefix 3](prefix(2)) => C-h
  - [prefix 4](prefix(2)) => C-c


## Special Keys 


  Following is a complete list of recognized keyboard key names, not all are
  able to be generated on every platform:-

     `backspace`, `delete`, `down`, `end`, `esc`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`, `f5`, `f6`, `f7`, `f8`, `f9`,
     `f10`, `f11`, `f12`, `f13`, `f14`, `f15`, `f16`, `f17`, `f18`, `f19`, `f20`, `home`, `insert`,
     `kp-0`, `kp-1`, `kp-2`, `kp-3`, `kp-4`, `kp-5`, `kp-6`, `kp-7`, `kp-8`, `kp-9`, `kp-add`,
     `kp-begin`, `kp-decimal`, `kp-delete`, `kp-divide`, `kp-down`, `kp-end`, `kp-enter`,
     `kp-home`, `kp-insert`, `kp-left`, `kp-multiply`, `kp-page-down`, `kp-page-up`,
     `kp-right`, `kp-subtract`, `kp-up`, `left`, `page-down`, `page-up`, `return`, `right`,
     `space`, `tab`, `up`

  The name of any key can be obtained by using [describe-key(2)](describe-key(2)).


## Mouse Keys 


  Following is a list of mouse related keys:-

  __mouse-pick-1__, __mouse-pick-2__, __mouse-pick-3__, __mouse-pick-4__, __mouse-pick-5__

  >  These keys are generated when the user presses a mouse button, these
     key events are always created. On most systems button 1 is the left, 2
     the middle and 3 the right mouse button. If the system only has a 2
     button mouse then a `mouse-pick-2` cannot be generated. The order of the
     buttons can be revered (i.e. 1 becomes right) and the number of
     buttons can be set using the [$system(5)]($system(5)) variable. Note that X-servers
     support up to 5 buttons and with the growing popularity of pilot
     'wheel' mice, the 4th and 5th button are often used to report wheel
     spin up and down events. The [translate-key(2)](translate-key(2)) command can be used to
     translate these buttons to the mouse wheel keys.

  __mouse-drop-1__, __mouse-drop-2__, __mouse-drop-3__, __mouse-drop-4__, __mouse-drop-5__

  >  These keys are generated when the user release a mouse button, these
     key events are always created.

  __mouse-move-1__, __mouse-move-2__, __mouse-move-3__, __mouse-move-4__, __mouse-move-5__,
 
  __mouse-move__

  >  These key events are generated when the user moves the mouse and are
     only if they are bound to a command. The key generated depends on
     whether a button is being held down by the user, if the user is
     pressing button 1 then a `mouse-move-1` key is created etc.

  __mouse-time-1__, __mouse-time-2__, __mouse-time-3__, __mouse-time-5__, __mouse-time-5__,

  __mouse-time__

  >  These key events are generated only when they are bound to a command.
     They are pseudo keys created when the user hold the mouse buttons done
     for a period of time, see __Pseudo Keys__ below for more information.

  __mouse-wheel-up__, __mouse-wheel-down__

  >  Pilot mouse wheel events, generated when the wheel is spun up or down
     respectively.


## Modifier Keys 


  The Shift, Control and Alt modifier keys will also generate key input
  whenever pressed or released. The keys are however only generated if they
  are bound to a command. The key names are as follows:

  __S-pick__, __S-drop__

  >  Shift modifier.

  __C-pick__, __C-drop__

  >  Control modifier.

  __A-pick__, __A-drop__

  >  Alt modifier.

  Note that the keys are only generated when another key is pressed, i.e. if
  the user presses and holds only the shift key, no "`S-pick`" key will be
  generated until another key, such as `down`, is also pressed. If the shift
  key is released before another key is pressed the event will not be
  reported.


## Pseudo Keys 


  Pseudo keys events cannot be directly created by the user, they are
  created internally by MicroEmacs. They are treated like normal keys to
  allow the user to handle the events properly themselves. Following is a
  complete list of the system generated pseudo keys:-

  __bell__

  >  The pseudo key is generated when the bell is rung.

  __callback__

  >  The pseudo key when a [create-callback(2)](create-callback(2)) macro is executed, this
     allows the executed macro to know it was executed via a
     create-callback as [@cck(4)](@cck(4)) will be set to this.

  __idle-pick__, __idle-drop__, __idle-time__

  >  The commands bound to these keys are executed when the system becomes
     idle for a period of time. See help on [$idle-time(5)]($idle-time(5)) for more
     information.

  __mouse-time-1__, __mouse-time-2__, __mouse-time-3__, __mouse-time-4__, __mouse-time-5__,  
  __mouse-time__
  
  >  The command bound to these keys are executed when mouse button 1, 2,
     3, 4, 5 or a combination are held bound for a period of time. See help
     on [$delay-time(5)]($delay-time(5)) for more information.

  __redraw__

  >  The command bound to this pseudo key is executed whenever the screen
     needs redrawing, by default it is bound to [screen-update(2)](screen-update(2)). If the
     user unbinds this key then __screen-update__ is still called, but if the
     user binds it to a function which does not redraw the screen, such as
     [void(2)](void(2)), then the screen will not be up-dated.

  The command executed is always given an argument, a non-zero argument
  indicates a forced complete redraw, an argument of zero indicates that
  just an up-date is required.


## Alt Key 


  The __Alt Key__ has special binding priorities defined as follows:-

  - Direct key binding (e.g. __A-b__ executes [file-browser](file-browser(3)))
  - Main menu hot key (e.g. __A-f__ opens the File menu)
  - Meta key binding (e.g. __A-space__ -> __esc space__ -> [set-mark](set-mark(2)))

  If the `ALT` key is to be used strictly as the Emacs Meta key then the
  bindings for the menu should be over-ridden by _Direct Key Bindings_ from
  the user configuration file i.e. to re-map the default MicroEmacs Alt key
  to equivalent `esc` keys then the following keys should be re-bound.

```{.emf}
        global-bind-key forward-word "A-f"    ; Over-ride File menu binding
        :                                     ; for all of the other menu items.
        :
        global-bind-key backward-word "A-b"   ; Over-ride the file browser.
        global-bind-key replace-string "A-r"  ; Over-ride tools binding.

```

  This creates a higher priority binding which overrides the underlying
  default. The commands that are displaced would have to be re-bound to
  different keys if required.


## KEYBOARD MACROS


  Keyboard macros do not store the name of keys, instead a more machine
  oriented format is used (usually in the form "`\s??`") these will work
  across platforms (assuming the key bindings are the same) but they may not

## NAME


  auto - Automatic source file line type detection


## SYNOPSIS


  __auto Mode__

  __A__ - mode line letter.


## DESCRIPTION


  When this mode is enabled the line style of the source file, with respect
  to `CR/LF/CTRL-Z` characters, are automatically detected and the file (if
  saved) is written out in the same style as it was read in. This mode is
  designed to solve the problems of MS-DOS which utilize a '__\r\n__' with every
  new line and a __ctrl-Z__ as a file terminator, conversely UNIX utilizes only
  '__\n__' as a line terminator.

  __auto__ mode therefore allows files to be edited across file system types
  without corrupting the line style of the native platform.

  At load time, if __auto__ detects CR/LF style line feeds then it enables the
  buffer modes [cr(2m)](cr(2m)) and [lf(2m)](lf(2m)); if a CTRL-Z is found at the end of the
  file then mode [ctrlz(2m)](ctrlz(2m)) is enabled. Otherwise these modes are cleared.

  At write time, if __auto__ mode is enabled then the file is written out is a
  style determined by modes __cr__, __lf__ and __ctrlz__. For example, if __cr__ and __lf__ were
  enabled and __ctrlz__ disabled then the file would be written out with new
  lines as '__\r\n__' and with no ending ctrl-z.

  If auto is not enabled then the file is written out in the style of the
  current platform, regardless of the current settings on modes __cr__, __lf__ and
  __ctrlz__.


## SUMMARY


  The operation on the modes may be summarized as follows:-


## UNIX Systems 


  - __auto Enabled__ UNIX and MS-DOS files may be edited normally, edits are
        saved in the format read by the system.
  - __auto Disabled__ UNIX files may be edited normally, files saved as UNIX
        files. MS-DOS files show a ^M character at the end of each line
        (editing is not advised if the purity of the MS-DOS is to be
        maintained), any edits are written back as displayed on the screen.


## MS-DOS Systems 


  - __auto Enabled__ UNIX and MS-DOS files may be edited normally, edits are
        saved in the format read by the system.
  - __auto Disabled__ on reading all files are read and editing may be
        undertaken normally. On writing, '\r's and a ctrl-Z are
        automatically added. The act of reading a UNIX file and re-writing
        it translates it to an MS-DOS file.


## NOTES


  This mode MUST be enabled globally when the file is loaded for the file
  style to be correctly detected.

  It is __strongly advised__ that auto mode is permanently enabled.

  Windows systems tend to use a '__\r\n__' style line feed but with no trailing
  ctrl-z.

! 2mbackup
## NAME


  backup - Automatic file backup of last edit


## SYNOPSIS


  __backup Mode__

  __B__ - mode line letter.


## DESCRIPTION


  __backup__ mode, when enabled, performs an automatic backup of the last edit
  when a save file operation is performed. The backup file name is derived
  from the base file name and is written into the same directory as the
  source file, the backup file name can be obtained from the variable
  [$buffer-backup(5)]($buffer-backup(5)).

  On unlimited file name length systems the naming convention used depends
  on bit __0x400__ of variable [$system(5)]($system(5)), if this bit is set then the system
  simulates a DOS style 8.3 file naming convention. If this bit is clear
  then variable [$kept-versions(5)]($kept-versions(5)) can be used to create multiple backup
  files.

  Where an existing backup file already exists, then the old backup file is
  removed and replaced by the newer backup file. The naming convention for
  backup files is defined as follows:-

  >  On unlimited length file name systems (UNIX and some Windows systems)
     with a single backup file, the following file naming conventions are
     used for file `xxxxx`:

            xxxxx -> xxxxx~

  >  On unlimited length file name systems with multiple backup files, the
     following file naming conventions are used for file `xxxxx`:

            xxxxx -> xxxxx.~?~

  >  Where `?` is the backup number, the most recent backup file is always
     "`.~0~`".

  >  On systems with an `xxxxxxxx.yyy` file name (MS-DOS etc), the following
     file naming conventions are used:

            xxxxxxxx      -> xxxxxxxx.~~~
            xxxxxxxx.yyy  -> xxxxxxxx.yy~
            xxxxxxxx.yyyy -> xxxxxxxx.yyy~

  > The environment variables [$MEBACKUPPATH(5)]($MEBACKUPPATH(5)) and [$MEBACKUPSUB(5)]($MEBACKUPSUB(5)) can be used
    to modify this behaviour.


## NOTES


  __backup__ is enabled by default.

  Reference should also be made to [undo(2)](undo(2)) which allows previous edits to be
  removed. Also see [$auto-time(5)]($auto-time(5)) and [autosv(2m)](autosv(2m)) which allows a timed backup
  of a running edit to be periodically performed.

  The user is warned to be extra careful if files ending in '`~`' or '`#`'s are
  used, it is advisable to disable backup creation (see [global-mode(2)](global-mode(2))) and
  auto-saving (`$auto-time = 0`). The author denies all responsibility (yet
  again) for any loss of data! Please be careful.

! 2mcrypt
## NAME


  crypt - Encrypted file mode


## SYNOPSIS


  __crypt Mode__

  __Y__ - mode line letter.


## DESCRIPTION


  __crypt__ mode enables encrypted files to be loaded and saved for security
  purposes. The key can be set at any time using the command
  [set-encryption-key(2)](set-encryption-key(2)). Warning, take care if setting this as a global
  mode, it can have side-effects.

  The encryption algorithm is a Beaufort Cipher with a variant key. This is
  reasonably difficult to decrypt. When you write out text, if `crypt` mode is
  active and there is no encryption key, MicroEmacs 2009 will ask:

  >   `Encryption String:`

  Type in a word or phrase of at least five and up to 128 characters for the
  encryption to use. If you look at the file which is then written out, all
  the printable characters have been scrambled. To read such a file later,
  use [find-cfile(3)](find-cfile(3)) to load _ciphertext_ files, you will be asked the
  encryption key before the file is read.

## NAME


  indent - Automatic indentation


## SYNOPSIS


  __indent Mode__

  __I__ - mode line letter.


## DESCRIPTION


  __indent__ mode, when enabled, ensures that a new text line is automatically
  indented to the same left hand column as the previous line's first
  non-white character. If the previous line contains no non-white characters
  then the line will not be indented. Automatic indentation is disabled when
  using _center_ or _right_ justification. __Indent__ is usually used in conjunction
  with [wrap(2m)](wrap(2m)) and [justify(2m)](justify(2m)).

## NAME


  justify - Justification Mode


## SYNOPSIS


  __justify Mode__

  __J__ - mode line letter.


## DESCRIPTION


  __justify__ mode, when enabled, performs paragraph justification as designated
  by [$fill-mode(5)]($fill-mode(5)) - capable of _left_, _right_, _both_ or _center_ justification of
  text. Justify removes all white spaces at the end of the line, if there
  are no non-white characters on the line then the line is always left
  empty. If the justification method is _center_ or _right_ then all white
  spaces are removed at the beginning of the line. If the line is longer
  than the [$buffer-fill-col(5)]($buffer-fill-col(5)) or the method is _left_ then nothing more is
  done, else the line is appropriately justified. The method used is set by
  the variable [$buffer-fill-mode(5)]($buffer-fill-mode(5)). Justify is usually used in conjunction
  with [wrap(2m)](wrap(2m)) and [indent(2m)](indent(2m)).

! 2mmagic
## NAME


  magic - Regular expression search


## SYNOPSIS


  __magic Mode__

  __M__ - mode line letter.


## DESCRIPTION


  __magic__ mode enables the regular expression search capability used in the
  search and the replace commands such as [search-forward(2)](search-forward(2)) and
  [query-replace-string(2)](query-replace-string(2)).

  In the magic mode of MicroEmacs 2009, certain characters gain special
  meanings when used in a search pattern. Collectively they are know as
  regular expressions, and a limited number of them are supported in
  MicroEmacs 2009. They grant greater flexibility when using the search
  commands (note that they also affect [isearch-forward(2)](isearch-forward(2)) commands).

  The symbols that have special meaning in magic mode are `^`, `$`, `.`, `\|`, `*`, `[`
  `]`, `\(` `\)`, `\{` `\}` and `\`.

  The characters `^` and `$` fix the search pattern to the beginning and end of
  line, respectively. The `^` character must appear at the beginning of the
  search string, and the `$` must appear at the end, otherwise they loose
  their meaning and are treated just like any other character. For example,
  in magic mode, searching for the pattern "`t$`" would put the cursor at the
  end of any line that ended with the letter '`t`'. Note that this is
  different than searching for "`t<NL>`", that is, '`t`' followed by a newline
  character. The character `$` (and `^`, for that matter) matches a position,
  not a character, so the cursor remains at the end of the line. But a
  newline is a character that must be matched, just like any other
  character, which means that the cursor is placed just after it - on the
  beginning of the next line.

  The character '`.`' has a very simple meaning - it matches any single
  character, except the newline. Thus a search for "`bad.er`" could match
  "`badger`", "`badder`" (slang), or up to the '`r`' of "`bad error`".

  The character `*` is known as closure, and means that zero or more of the
  preceding character will match. If there is no character preceding, `*` has
  no special meaning, and since it will not match with a newline, `*` will
  have no special meaning if preceded by the beginning of line symbol `^` or
  the literal newline character `<NL>`. The notion of zero or more characters
  is important. If, for example, your cursor was on the line

     This line is missing two vowels.


  and a search was made for "`a*`", the cursor would not move, because it is
  guaranteed to match no letter '`a`', which satisfies the search conditions.
  If you wanted to search for one or more of the letter 'a', you would
  search for "`aa*`", which would match the letter `a`, then zero or more of
  them, note that this pattern is better searched using "`a+`".

  The character "`+`" is the same as "`*`" except that it searches for one or
  more occurrences of the preceding character.

  The character `[` indicates the beginning of a character class. It is
  similar to the _any_ (`.`) character, but you get to choose which characters
  you want to match. The character class is ended with the character `]`. So,
  while a search for "`ba.e`" will match "`bane`", "`bade`", "`bale`", "`bate`", et
  cetera, you can limit it to matching "`babe`" and "`bake`" by searching for
  "`ba[bk]e`". Only one of the characters inside the `[` and `]` will match a
  character. If in fact you want to match any character except those in the
  character class, you can put a `^` as the first character. It must be the
  first character of the class, or else it has no special meaning. So, a
  search for `[^aeiou]` will match any character except a vowel, but a search
  for `[aeiou^]` will match any vowel or a `^`. If you have a lot of characters
  in order that you want to put in the character class, you may use a dash
  (`-`) as a range character. So, `[a-z]` will match any letter (or any lower
  case letter if exact mode is on), and `[0-9a-f]` will match any digit or any
  letter '`a`' through '`f`', which happen to be the characters for hexadecimal
  numbers. If the dash is at the beginning or end of a character class, it
  is taken to be just a dash.

  The `?` character provides a simple zero or one occurrence test of the
  previous character e.g. "`ca?r`" matches "`cr`" and "`car`", it will not match
  "`caar`".

  Where a previous item has a range of repetitions then the `\{N,M\}` syntax
  may be used to denote the minimum and maximum iterations of the previous
  item. Where a set quantity of repetitions is required then the simpler
  syntax of `\{N\}` may be used. i.e. "`ca\{2\}r`" matches "`caar`", "`ca\{2,3\}r`"
  matches "`caar`" and "`caaar`".

  The escape character `\` is for those times when you want to be in magic
  mode, but also want to use a regular expression character to be just a
  character. It turns off the special meaning of the character. So a search
  for "`it\.`" will search for a line with "`it.`", and not "`it`" followed by any
  other character. The escape character will also let you put `^`, `-`, or `]`
  inside a character class with no special side effects.

  In [search-replace](query-replace-string(2)) strings the `\(` `\)` pair may be used to group characters
  for in the search string for recall in the replacement string. The `\(` `\)`
  bracket pair is recalled using `\1`-`\9` in the replace string, `\1` is the
  first pair, `\1` the second and so on. Hence to replace `%dgdg%name%dhdh%`
  with `%dgdg%names%dhdh%` then we could use the following search replace
  string `\(%[a-z]+%\)\([a-z]*\)\(%[a-z]+%\)` replacing with `\1\2s\3`.

  `\0` in the replace string implies the whole string.

  A summary of magic mode special characters are defined as follows:-

  >  __^__

  > >       Anchor search at beginning of line

  >  __$__

  > >       Anchor search at end of line

  >  __.__

  > >       Match any character except <NL>

  >  __*__

  > >       Match zero or more occurrences of the preceding item.

  >  __\|__

  > >       Match either/or i.e. car\|bike matches the work car and matches
            the word bike.

  >  __+__

  > >       Match one or more occurrences of the preceding item.

  >  __?__

  > >       Match zero or one occurrences of the preceeding item.

  >  __[]__

  > >       Match a class of characters ([a-z] would be all alphabetics)

  >  __\__

  > >       Take next literally

  >  __\{___N___,___M___\}__

  > >       Match a minimum of N occurrences and maximum of M occurrences of
            the preceeding item.

  >  __\{___N___\}__

  > >       Match a N occurrences of the preceeding item.

  >  __\(...\)__

  > >       Delimit pattern to replicate in replace string. Max of 9 allowed.
            Called in replace string with \1,..,\9. 1 being 1st etc. \0 or \&
            in the replace string is the whole string. i.e.

  > >       Search: \(ab\)\(dc\)
            Replace: \1\2 \1\2
            on "abdc" => "abdc abdc"

  undo - Retain edit modifications


## SYNOPSIS


  __undo Mode__

## DESCRIPTION


  __undo__ mode, when enabled, stores a history of all user edits so that the
  command [undo(2)](undo(2)) may be used to undo the last _n_ edits to a buffer. If this
  mode is not enabled the __undo__ command has no effect.

  Obviously memory is required to store this information, particularly
  storing deleted, reformed or replaced text, users editing large files or
  operating in restricted memory environments may wish to use this mode
  selectively.


## NOTES


  The __undo__ information is flushed, and is effectively lost, when a save
  operation is performed on the buffer.

## DESCRIPTION


  __usr1__ through __usr8__ modes have no predefined purpose, they are present to
  provide the user with the ability to store some buffer state. All of these
  modes are off by default. For example, the user may wish to have two
  commands bound to the same key, with another command to toggle which one

## NAME


  binary - Binary editor mode


## SYNOPSIS


  __binary Mode__

  __b__ - mode line letter.


## DESCRIPTION


  __binary__ mode is enabled when a file is edited in binary mode. The mode is
  automatically enabled when a file is loaded as a binary file via
  [find-bfile(3)](find-bfile(3)).

  When a file is loaded using binary mode, every 16 bytes is converted into
  a line of text giving the hex address of the current position in the file,
  the bytes as hexadecimal numbers and all printable characters at the end
  of the line (all non-printable characters are displayed as a '`.`').
  However, This format makes it memory hungry in that every 16 bytes of the
  file requires a 78 character line (approximately 5 times more memory!).
  For a more memory efficient binary mode see [rbin(2m)](rbin(2m)).

  When writing out a file which has binary mode enabled the format of each
  line must have the binary mode format which is as follows:

     <address>: XX XX XX XX XX .... XX XX | <text-form>


  Only the hex values (the `XX`'s) between the starting '_:_' marker and the
  terminating '|' character are used, the _<address>_ and _<text-form>_ are
  ignored.


## EXAMPLE


  Given a single line MSDOS file:-

     Live long and prosper.


  When loaded in using __binary__ mode the following 2 line buffer will be
  produced:-

     00000000: 4C 69 76 65 20 6C 6F 6E 67 20 61 6E 64 20 70 72  |  Live long and pr
     00000010: 6F 73 70 65 72 2E 0D 0A 1A                       |  osper....


  Note the "`0D 0A 1A`" at the end, this is due to MSDOS's "`\n\r`" carriage
  returns and `^Z` file termination, these characters are unprintable and are
  shown as '`.`' at the end of the line.

  When saving a binary file, only the text between the '`:`' and '`|`' is
  considered and it may contain any number of hexadecimal numbers. The given
  file could be made UNIX compatible by editing the buffer to:-

     00000000: 4C 69 76 65 20 6C 6F 6E 67 20 61 6E 64 20 70 72  |  Live long and pr
     00000010: 6F 73 70 65 72 2E 0D                       |  osper....


  If the word "__long__" is required to be removed, the following would not
  work:-

     00000000: 4C 69 76 65 20 6C 6F 6E 67 20 61 6E 64 20 70 72  |  Live and pr
     00000010: 6F 73 70 65 72 2E 0D 0A 1A                       |  osper....


  The ASCII end letters are ignored, instead the following operation must be
  performed which removes the characters from the binary representation:-

     00000000: 4C 69 76 65 20 61 6E 64 20 70 72  |  Live long and pr
     00000010: 6F 73 70 65 72 2E 0D 0A 1A                       |  osper....


  One could be nasty by doing the following:-

     00000000: 4C 69 76 65 20 73 68 6F 72 74 20 61 6E 64 20 |
     00000010: 64 6F 6E 27 74 20 70 72 6F 73 70 65 72 2E 0D 0A 1A           |


  ("Live short and don't prosper").

! 2mautosv
## NAME


  autosv - Automatic file save


## SYNOPSIS


  __autosv Mode__

  __a__ - mode line letter.


## DESCRIPTION


  When this mode is enabled when the buffer is changed it will be
  automatically saved to a temporary file [$auto-time(5)]($auto-time(5)) later.

  Automatic saving for a buffer will not occur if

  >  The buffer name starts with a '*', this is considered a temporary
     system buffer.

  > [$auto-time(5)]($auto-time(5)) is set to 0, this disables auto-saving for all buffers.

  >  The buffer does not a file name from which to generate a temporary
     file name. When this occurs the error message:

      `[Auto-writeout failure for buffer xxxxx]`

  >  MicroEmacs 2009 can not write to the generated temporary file name.
     When this occurs the error message:

      `[Auto-writeout failure for file xxxxx#]`

  On unlimited length file name systems (UNIX), the temporary file naming
  convention used for file `xxxxx`:

     `xxxxx -> xxxxx#`

  On systems with an `xxxxxxxx.yyy` file name (DOS etc), the following file
  naming convention is used:

     `xxxxxxxx     -> xxxxxxxx.###`
     `xxxxxxxx.y   -> xxxxxxxx.y##`
     `xxxxxxxx.yy  -> xxxxxxxx.yy#`
     `xxxxxxxx.yyy -> xxxxxxxx.yy#`


## NOTES


  This mode MUST be enabled globally when the file is loaded for the file
  style to be correctly detected.

  It is __strongly advised__ that autosv mode is permanently enabled.

  Auto-save files of URL files (i.e. "`ftp://...`" and "`http://...`") are
  written to the system's temporary directory. This avoids potentially slow
  auto-saves. This can however lead to recovery problems as the buffer name
  must be used to avoid auto-saving conflict with other buffers with the
  same base file name but different paths.

## SYNOPSIS


  __hide Mode__

  __H__ - mode line letter.


## DESCRIPTION


  This mode can only be set on a buffer and when enabled the buffer is
  effectively hidden from the user. When set the buffer is hidden from the
  buffer completion list used by commands such as [find-buffer(2)](find-buffer(2)), the buffer
  is also ignored by commands [list-buffers(2)](list-buffers(2)), [save-some-buffers(2)](save-some-buffers(2)) and

## NAME


  nact - Buffer not active


## SYNOPSIS


  __nact Mode__

  __n__ - mode line letter.


## DESCRIPTION


  This mode can not be set and is used to indicate that the buffer has not
  been activated, i.e. the buffer has not been displayed in a window. If the
  buffer is linked to a file but has not been displayed, so is not active,
  the file will not have been loaded into the buffer.

  The [list-buffers(2)](list-buffers(2)) command output denotes active buffers with a '@'
  character in the left hand column, inactive buffers have a ' '.

  This mode can not be tested using the more usual [&bmode(4)](&bmode(4)) macro command
  as it only operates on the current buffer as which point the mode cannot
  be set. Instead the [&nbmode(4)](&nbmode(4)) macro command must be used.

## NAME


  rbin - Reduced binary editor mode


## SYNOPSIS


  __rbin Mode__

  __r__ - mode line letter.


## DESCRIPTION


  __rbin__ mode is enabled when a file is edited in reduced binary mode. The
  mode is automatically enabled when a file is loaded as a binary data file
  via [find-file(2)](find-file(2)).

  When a file is loaded using __rbin__ mode, every 256 bytes is converted into a
  line of text, the line is a single list of hex numbers 512 characters
  long, 2 bytes for each character. This format is not very user friend
  unlike [binary(2m)](binary(2m)) mode, but is much more memory efficient (requiring
  approximately 2 times more memory than the file size).

  When writing out a file which has rbin mode enabled the format of each
  line must be correct, namely an even number of hex numbers with no other
  characters.


## EXAMPLE


  Given a single line MSDOS file:-

     Live long and prosper.


  When loaded in using __binary__ mode the following 2 line buffer will be
  produced:-

     4C697665206C6F6E6720616E642070726F737065722E0D0A1A


  Note the "`0D 0A 1A`" at the end, this is due to MSDOS's "`\n\r`" carriage
  returns and `^Z` file termination. The given file could be made UNIX
  compatible by editing the buffer to:-

      4C697665206C6F6E6720616E642070726F737065722E0D


## NOTES


  __rbin__ and __binary__ modes are mutually exclusive, i.e. they cannot both be
  enabled at the same time.

! 2mfence
## NAME


  fence - Auto fence matching mode


## SYNOPSIS


  __fence Mode__

  __f__ - mode line letter.


## DESCRIPTION


  __fence__ mode can be used to enable or disable the automatic displaying of
  and open fence when the corresponding closing fence is typed. When the
  mode is enabled and the closing fence ('`)`' '`]`' or '`}`') is typed the cursor
  is temporarily move to the position of the opening fence. The duration of
  the move can be controlled by the [$pause-time(5)]($pause-time(5)) variable; any user input
  interrupts the display.

  If the buffer is configured to use a _C_ style auto [indent(2)](indent(2)), the search
  algorithm used is '_C_' aware and if a matching fence is not found then the
  bell is rung as a warning. Otherwise any closing fence which cannot be
  matched is ignored.

  The cursor can be moved to the matching fence using the
  [goto-matching-fence(2)](goto-matching-fence(2)) command.


## NOTES


  The following are considered closing fences:

     }  )  ] > */ #endif


  These are match with the following opening fences respectively:

     {  (  [ < /* #if


  In MicroEmacs the use of fence mode has been depreciated. Matching fence
  hilighting has been implemented as a macro and configured via the Platform
  page of [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)).

! 2 languageTemplates
## FILE LANGUAGE TEMPLATES


  MicroEmacs 2009 provides a large range of macros and templates to deal
  with the most commonly occurring types of ASCII file that may be edited.
  However, there is a requirement for users to extend this capability to
  include more obscure file types, in addition to bespoke files found
  internally within organizations, or devised by the user.

  For each file type, MicroEmacs 2009 may be tailored to recognize the file
  and modify it's hilighting, key binding configuration, osd display and
  indentation to accommodate the file. In addition, new shorthand macros may
  be introduced to help deal with the contents of the file.

  This section outlines the steps to be taken to integrate a new file
  language template into MicroEmacs 2009. [buffer-init(3)](buffer-init(3)) automates many of
  the operations defined below and it is suggested that this is a preferable
  method to add a new language template into MicroEmacs.


## The scope of the File Type 


  The first step is to decide the scope of the file, this will determine
  where the file hook should be defined. The options are:-

  __A standard file type not supported__
  
  >  If this is a standard file type not supported by MicroEmacs 2009 then
     it should be added to `me.emf`, in addition [contact us](MicroEmacs - Contact Information) and we will add
     it to the standard release. Any macro files associated with this file
     type should be available globally and are added to the MicroEmacs
     _macro_ directory.

  __Local To your organization__
  
  >  If it is a file type local to your organization then it should be
     added to your _company_.emf file. Any macro files associated with the
     file type should be added to your local company MicroEmacs 2009
     directory.

  __Local to an individual__

  >  If this is a file type that is only used by a limited number of
     individuals then it should be added to the _user_.emf file. Any files
     associated with the file type are added to your local user MicroEmacs
     2009 directory.


## Recognizing the File Type 


  The next step to adding a new file type is to get MicroEmacs 2009 to
  recognize the file as the new type. Recognition is performed by the
  [File Hooks](fileHooks(2)) which perform recognition on the file extension and/or
  the file content. The name of the file type must be determined, this is typically
  the name of the file prepended by `hk`. e.g. a file with extension _foo_ uses
  the file `hkfoo.emf` for it's language specific definitions.

  Using the [add-file-hook(2)](add-file-hook(2)) invocation the file recognition is bound to the
  file hook macro whenever the file type is loaded. The file hook is added
  to the appropriate global, company or user start up file as determined in
  step 1. The file hooks for file _foo_ might be defined as follows, depending
  upon the recognition method:-

  __Recognizing the extension__
  
  >  To recognize the file extension, then a space separated list of
     extensions may be defined, including the dot '`.`' (or other) extension
     separator.

```{.emf}
            add-file-hook ".foo"       fhook-foo

```

  __Recognizing a magic editor string in the file__
 
  >   If the file type adopts multiple extensions (or does not use a file
     extension) then an editor specific string may be inserted into the
     file to enable the editor to recognize it, typically of the form `-!-`
     _type_ `-!-`, if the string is GNU Emacs compatible then the `-*-`
     convention may be used. The binding is defined as:-

```{.emf}
            -1 add-file-hook "-!-[ \t]*foo.*-!-"           fhook-foo

```

  __Recognizing a magic string in the file__
  
  >  UNIX files use a "`#!<path>`" notation for executable ASCII files. If
     the file is this type of file (or uses any other type of common string
     in the as the first characters of a file) then the binding may be
     defined as follows, in this case we have assumed _foo_ is the UNIX
     executable variety i.e. `#!/usr/local/bin/foo`:-

```{.emf}
            1 add-file-hook "^#!/.*foo" fhook-foo

```

  Any, or all of the above recognition methods may be employed to invoke the
  language specific macro. Note that the methods are evaluated in a LIFO
  order, hence it is possible to over-ride an existing method.


## Defining the Macro File 


  Once the hook has been defined, the language specific file must be
  created. Create the language specific file with the same name as defined
  in the hooks, removing the __fhook-__ prefix and replacing it with __hk__, i.e.
  `fhook-foo` invokes the language specific file `hkfoo.emf`. Create, the file
  and add the file hook macro. for example `hkfoo.emf` contents may be defined
  as:

```{.emf}
        define-macro fhook-foo
            ; Temporary comment to make sure that it works.
            ml-write "Loaded a foo file"
        !emacro
        ml-write "[MicroEmacs foo file hook loaded]"

```

  The file hook may be tested by exiting and re-loading MicroEmacs 2009, or
  simply by executing the file containing the __add-file-hook__ function. Once
  the file bindings are installed a _foo_ file may be loaded and the hook
  message should be displayed.

  The best way to create a new file hook is to find an existing file type
  with similar support to the new file hook you wish to create and re-use
  the hook code to create the new one.


## Modifying an Existing file hook 


  The standard file hooks supplied with MicroEmacs 2009 should not be
  modified, typically a user will want to extend the repertoire of
  hi-lighting tokens to encompass locally defined programming libraries or
  syntactical extensions, in addition to extending support macros that are
  associated with the file type. In this case, an extension to the hook
  function is required. The hook file __myXXX.emf__, allows extensions to be
  made to the __hkXXX.emf__, without editing the original file. This may be
  considered to be an _include_ file and is executed, if it exists, after the
  __hk__ file has been executed. i.e. if the hook file __hkfoo.emf__ is already
  defined and extensions are added to __myfoo.emf__.

  Note that the __myXXX.emf__ files do not typically include any __fhook-XXX__
  functions, the original _fhook_ functions would be used. However, if a
  different buffer environment is required from the one created be the hook,
  such as a different setting of [tab(2m)](tab(2m)) mode, the hook function should be
  copied to __myXXX.emf__ and altered appropriately.

  Most extensions and changes to the buffer environment may be performed
  using __myXXX.emf__. If the extension macro file includes a macro definition
  __my-fhook-XXX__, then __my-fhookXXX__ is automatically executed after __fhookXXX__
  has been run.


## Adding Hilighting definitions 


  File specific hilighting is used to pick out key words and tokens used
  within the file type, it greatly improves readability; the hilighting is
  also used for [printing](print-buffer(2)). The hilighting is defined within the body of the
  file and is executed once when the hook file is loaded, this occurs when
  the hook function is executed. During development of the hilighting code,
  it is usually necessary to [execute](execute-buffer(2)) the hook buffer to view the effects of
  any changes to the hilighting.

  The hilighting is defined using the command [hilight(2)](hilight(2)) which requires a
  hilighting identifier, used to identify the hilighting scheme. This
  identifier is dynamically allocated when the hook file is loaded, again
  using _foo_, the identifier is allocated at the top of the file and is
  protected such that a value is assigned once only.

```{.emf}
        !if &sequal .hilight.foo "ERROR"
            set-variable .hilight.foo &pinc .hilight.next 1
        !endif

```

  The variable `.hilight.next` allocates unique hilighting numbers, typically
  a single hilighting number is consumed, incrementing the `.hilight.next`
  variable ready for the next allocation. The hilighting color scheme is
  defined in a macro variable `.hilight.ext`, where _ext_ is the name of the
  language scheme (i.e. _foo_).

  Given a hilighting number, the hilighting scheme may be defined. Each of
  the tokens in the language is assigned a hilighting color, for our simple
  _foo_ file type:-

```{.emf}
        0 hilight .hilight.foo 1                $global-scheme
        hilight .hilight.foo 2 "#"              .scheme.comment
        hilight .hilight.foo 4 "\"" "\"" "\\"   .scheme.string
        hilight .hilight.foo 0 "'.'"            .scheme.quote
        hilight .hilight.foo 0 "'\\\\.'"        .scheme.quote ; '\?' quoted char

        hilight .hilight.foo 1 "if"             .scheme.keyword
        hilight .hilight.foo 1 "then"           .scheme.keyword
        hilight .hilight.foo 1 "else"           .scheme.keyword
        hilight .hilight.foo 1 "endif"          .scheme.keyword

```

  When the hilighting tokens have been defined, the hilighting scheme is
  bound to the buffer. This is performed by assigning [$buffer-hilight(5)]($buffer-hilight(5))
  with the hilighting scheme within the _fhook_ macro body, e.g.

```{.emf}
        define-macro fhook-foo
            ; Assign the hilighting
            set-variable $buffer-hilight .hilight.foo
            ; Temporary comment to make sure that it works.
            ml-write "Loaded a foo file"
        !emacro

```

  Putting it all together `hkfoo.emf` now comprises:-

```{.emf}
        !if &sequal .hilight.foo "ERROR"
            ; Allocate a hilighting scheme number
            set-variable .hilight.foo &pinc .hilight.next 1
        !endif

        ml-write "[MicroEmacs foo file hook loaded]"

```

## Adding a Template 


  A template inserts initial text into a new file that is created. This
  mechanism is typically used to insert a standard header into the file on
  creation. The insertion text is defined within a template file, given the
  file extension [etf(8)](etf(8)), which is created in the corresponding global,
  company or user directory as determined in step 1. The template is named
  _ext_.etf, so for our example file _foo_, the template file is called `foo.etf`.
  We shall simply add a file header, our comment is `#` (as defined by the
  hilighting tokens). Our example _foo_ template file `foo.etf` may be defined
  as follows:-


     #-!- foo -!- #################################
     #
     #  Created By    : $USER_NAME$
     #  Created       : $ASCII_TIME$
     #  Last Modified : <160495.1521>
     #
     #  Description
     #
     #  Notes
     #
     #  History
     #
     #  Copyright (c) $YEAR$ $COMPANY_NAME$.
     ##############################################


  The template file must be explicitly loaded by the hook file, within the
  __fhook__ function. A new file condition may be tested within the fhook macro
  by checking the numerical argument, an argument of 0 indicates that this
  is a new file. The template file is inserted with an invocation of
  [etfinsrt(3)](etfinsrt(3)). The fhook macro checks the argument and inserts the template
  file as follows:-

```{.emf}
        ; File hook - called when new file is loaded.
        define-macro fhook-foo
            ; if arg is 0 this is a new file so add template
            !if &not @#
                etfinsrt "foo"
            !endif
            ; Assign the hilighting
            set-variable $buffer-hilight .hilight.foo
            ; Temporary comment to make sure that it works.
            ml-write "Loaded a foo file"
        !emacro

```

## Adding abbreviations 


  Abbreviations are short-cut expansions which may be defined for the
  language specific file. The abbreviations are defined in a [eaf(8)](eaf(8)) file,
  _ext_.eaf, located in the appropriately defined MicroEmacs directory. The
  abbreviation file defines the key sequences which may be automatically
  inserted, under user intervention, using [expand-abbrev(2)](expand-abbrev(2)). An abbreviation
  file for _foo_, `foo.eaf`, may be defined as:-

     if "if \p\rthen\rendif\P"
     el "else\r\p\P"


  The binding to the hook is defined in the _fhook_ macro using
  [buffer-abbrev-file(2)](buffer-abbrev-file(2)). For the example language file foo the fhook macro
  becomes:-

```{.emf}
        ; File hook - called when new file is loaded.
        define-macro fhook-foo
            ; if arg is 0 this is a new file so add template
            !if &not @#
                etfinsrt "foo"
            !endif
            ; Assign the hilighting
            set-variable $buffer-hilight .hilight.foo
            ; Set the abbreviation file
            buffer-abbrev-file "foo"
            ; Temporary comment to make sure that it works.
            ml-write "Loaded a foo file"
        !emacro

```

## Automatic Indentation 


  Automatic indentation may be applied to the file, such that the
  indentation is automatically performed when new lines are entered into the
  file. Indentation also benefits from automatic re-styling operations using
  [restyle-region(3)](restyle-region(3)) and [restyle-buffer(3)](restyle-buffer(3)).

  The indentation style is declared by defining language tokens that
  constitute positions in the syntax where the indentation is changed. The
  indentation requires a unique identifier to identify the indentation
  style, the hilighting identifier is used. If hilighting is not defined,
  then the language template may still obtain an identifier as described in
  the hilighting section.

  The indention is create with an argument of `0` to the [indent(2)](indent(2)) command,
  the subsequent tokens are defined using __indent__ with no argument. For our
  simple _foo_ syntax then the indentation might be defined as follows:-

```{.emf}
        0 indent  .hilight.foo 2 10
        indent .hilight.foo n "then" 4
        indent .hilight.foo s "else" -4
        indent .hilight.foo o "endif" -4

```

  This provides an indentation of the form:-

     if condition
     then
            XXXX
     else
            if condition
            then
                XXXX
            endif
     endif


  The indentation is bound to the buffer in the _fhook_ macro by defining
  [$buffer-indent(5)]($buffer-indent(5)). For the example file foo then the fhook is defined as:-

```{.emf}
        ; File hook - called when new file is loaded.
        define-macro fhook-foo
            ; if arg is 0 this is a new file so add template
            !if &not @#
                etfinsrt "foo"
            !endif
            ; Assign the hilighting
            set-variable $buffer-hilight .hilight.foo
            ; Assign the buffer indentation
            set-variable $buffer-indent .hilight.foo
            ; Set the abbreviation file
            buffer-abbrev-file "foo"
            ; Temporary comment to make sure that it works.
            ml-write "Loaded a foo file"
        !emacro

```

## Setting Buffer Modes 


  Buffer modes which are to be adopted (or discarded) by the language
  specific file are defined in the _fhook_ macro. Typical modes that are
  applied are:-

  [time](time(2m))
  
  >  Enables time stamping on the file, modifying the time stamp field with
     the modification date and time.

  [indent](indent(2m))
  
  >  Automatic indentation, where the cursor is returned to the same column
     on entering a new line, rather than to the start of the line.

  As an example, the _foo_ _fhook_ file becomes:-

```{.emf}
        ; File hook - called when new file is loaded.
        define-macro fhook-foo
            ; if arg is 0 this is a new file so add template
            !if &not @#
                etfinsrt "foo"
            !endif
            ; Assign the hilighting
            set-variable $buffer-hilight .hilight.foo
            ; Assign the buffer indentation
            set-variable $buffer-indent .hilight.foo
            ; Set the abbreviation file
            buffer-abbrev-file "foo"
            ; Set up the buffer modes
            1 buffer-mode "time"
            1 buffer-mode "indent"
            ; Temporary comment to make sure that it works.
            ml-write "Loaded a foo file"
        !emacro

```

## Assigning New Bindings 


  New bindings and language specific macros may be added to the language
  specific file. New macros, to extend the repertoire of commands
  specifically developed for the language file are defined within the macro
  body using [define-macro(2)](define-macro(2)) these are automatically loaded when the hook
  file is loaded, which in turn is loaded when the file type is identified
  and loaded.

  New bindings, which may be associated with new macros or existing
  commands, are assigned within the _fhook_ macro. As an example, we shall
  extend the _foo_ language file to include a commenting and uncommenting
  macros, locally binding the macros to the keys "`C-c C-c`" and "`C-c C-d`"
  respectively. The macro definitions are defined as follows:-

```{.emf}
        ; Macro to comment a line
        define-macro foo-comment-line
            !while &gre &pdec @# 1 0
                beginning-of-line
                insert-string "#"
                beginning-of-line
                forward-line
            !done
        !emacro

        ; Macro to remove a comment from a line
        define-macro foo-uncomment-line
            !while &gre &pdec @# 1 0
                beginning-of-line
                -1 search-forward "#"
                backward-delete-char
                forward-line
            !done
        !emacro

```

  The key bindings for the macros are defined for the local buffer ONLY, as
  such are added using [buffer-bind-key(2)](buffer-bind-key(2)). The bindings are declared in the
  _fhook_ macro as follows:-

```{.emf}
        ; File hook - called when new file is loaded.
        define-macro fhook-foo
            ; if arg is 0 this is a new file so add template
            !if &not @#
                etfinsrt "foo"
            !endif
            ; Assign the hilighting
            set-variable $buffer-hilight .hilight.foo
            ; Assign the buffer indentation
            set-variable $buffer-indent .hilight.foo
            ; Set the abbreviation file
            buffer-abbrev-file "foo"
            ; Set up the buffer modes
            1 buffer-mode "time"
            1 buffer-mode "indent"
            ; Set up local bindings
            buffer-bind-key foo-comment-line "C-c C-c"
            buffer-bind-key foo-uncomment-line "C-c C-d"
            ; Temporary comment to make sure that it works.
            ml-write "Loaded a foo file"
        !emacro

```

## Allowing Other to Modify the Hook 


  Other users of the file hook may need to modify or extend the file hook,
  the most common form is the addition of user specific hilight tokens.
  MicroEmacs uses a simple mechanism of executing a user hook extension file
  if it exists. The extension file name must be of the form __myXXX.emf__, i.e.
  for our example it must be "`myfoo.emf`". This is performed at the end of
  the macro file so that anything within the file can be altered, it is
  executed as follows:-

```{.emf}
        ; load in user extensions if found
        !force execute-file "myfoo"

```

  Note the [!force(4)](!force(4)) directive is used as the file may not exist.


## Summing Up 


  The previous sections have presented the basic steps involved in setting
  up a new language file template. They cater for simple file types, for
  more complex examples then browse the __hkxxx.emf__ files.

  The completed files that should have been generated by following the
  previous examples are now presented:-

  __file.foo__

     # This is a comment.
     if condition
     then
            do something
     else
            if condition
            then
                do something
            endif
     endif


  __hkfoo.emf__

```{.emf}
        !if &sequal .hilight.foo "ERROR"
            ; Allocate a hilighting scheme number
            set-variable .hilight.foo &pinc .hilight.next 1

## INSTALLATION


  This page provides introductory notes for the installation and setup of
  MicroEmacs 2009 build in 2024.

## Single File Binary Install

  Since 2009 the prefered way for  installation  is the use of the single file
  binaries. The background is described here: [http://www.jasspa.com/zeroinst.html](http://www.jasspa.com/zeroinst.html).
  The  MicroEmacs  executable  in this case contains the binary as well as all
  macro files and optionally as well some dictionary files and the help file.
  So the user only needs to  download a binary for its own  platform,  make it
  executable and place it into a directory  belonging to its `PATH` variable.
  Commonly these places are `~/.bin` or `~/.local/bin` for Unix systems. In
  2024 the following platforms and binaries are supported:
  
  - _Linux_ - Terminal (mecb) and Terminal and X11 version (mewb) were mainly 
    Debian and Red Hat based distros are provided  which might be used on many
    other distros - we provide kernel 4, 5 and 6 builds for x86_64 platforms. 
    There is as well a combined version (mecwb) which can run both in X11 mode
    or in terminal mode if the `-n` argument is provided.
  - _FreeBSD_ - there are as well mecb, mewb and mecwb versions provided for 
    FreeBSD version 14 (and later) - see Linux for more info.
  - _MacOS_ - Terminal  (mecb) and  Terminal and X11 version  (mewb), the latter
    requires  the  XQuartz  extension,  MacOS 12 to 14  builds  are  currently
    available,  as with the Linux  build  there is as well a combined  version
    (mecw).
  - _Windows_ - Terminal (mecb) and Windows version (mewb) - they should work on
    all recent Windows systems, we regular check only on Wine emulator.
  - _Cygwin-Windows_  - For the Cygwin system (3.5 and higher) on Windows
    there are as well  prebuild executables  for the cygwin  terminal (mecb)
    and then as well GUI versions (mew and mecwb) which require the Cygwin X11
    libraries to be installed on Cygwin.
   
  _Installation:_ Just  download the file (mecb, mewb, mecwB) for your platform
  place it as mec, mew and me into a folder  belonging  to your  PATH, make it
  executable and run it.

  At the  first  run you will be asked  initially  for your  user name and the
  default  user path,  usually  it is  `~/.jasspa`.  As it a first  step it is
  usually  required  to run the  command  `"Esc x"  user-setup`  to select the
  default  keyboad  and  language  in the dialog. You can as well use the menu
  entry  "Tools->User  Setup". If you run the terminal version you can as well
  execute  the menu with `"Esc ="` and using the cursor  keys. To get  Termcap
  colors you might in the terminal version as well select in the "User Setup -
  Platform Tab" the Termcap colors.  Thereafter your should restart the editor
  and in case  you do not get the  Termcap  colors  you can try to  start  the
  terminal version like this:
  
  >  `TERM=xterm mec FILENAME`
  
  Your user settings are stored in the folder `~/.jasspa` usually, although this
  can be changed by  changing  the  `MEPATH`  environment  variable.  A common
  setting could be `MEPATH=~/.config/jasspa`.
  
  If you run an  Ubuntu  executable  build  on the  Github  server  you  might
  sometimes  see for  instance on a Fedora  system a  libterminfo  warning you
  might throw this away by writing a Bash function in your .bashrc like this:
  
         function mecn {
            TERM=xterm mec "$@" 2> /dev/null
         }

  In case of problems you might as well try to use TERM=rxvt.
    
  __Getting Help__
  
  In case of trouble use the issue link on the Github project page:
  https::/github.com/mittelmark/microemacs/issues

  Below is the old  description of an installation  for a simple me (mec, mew)
  executable  (terminal or  X11/Windows  version)  together  with the required
  macro files described. If you prefere the single file install just described
  above, you do not need to read further. 
  
  Hint: All macro files for the  standalone  builds are  accessible  using the
  bfs://macros path within your MicroEmacs text editor.
  
## Quick Install of ME barebones and Macro Files

  2024: The information below is mostly outdated, it describes an installation
  of the barebone mec, mew and mecw executables  without attached macro folder
  which require a separate installation of the jasspa macros.

  The quickest way to install MicroEmacs for testing without reading the
  rest of this document is to:-

  - Create a new directory i.e. `jasspa`.
  - Unpack the macros archive into this directory.
  - Unpack the executable into this directory.
  - Run `me` from this directory.

  On starting, you will be prompted for a default directory, accept the
  defaults. Use the mouse and configure the user from the menu bar:-

  This allows the user and screen settings to be altered. On becoming more
  accustomed to the editor then a fuller installation may be performed.

  >  __NOTE:__ The binary versions of the executables held on the site include
     the platform name as part of the executable name i.e. __me__ for `DOS` is
     called __medos.exe__. On installing the binaries onto the target machine,
     you should rename the executable to __me__ or __me.exe__, whatever is
     appropriate. The ONLY exception to this rule is the Microsoft Windows
     executable where __mewin32.exe__ should be renamed to __me32.exe__. Our reason
     for this naming is to allow the executables to be unpacked in the same
     directory and not be confused with each other.


## Installation Directories 


  The suggested installation structure for all platforms is defined as:-

                  jasspa
                  / | \
                 /  |  \
                /   |   \
         spelling macros company


  This directory structure is suggested to facilitate upgrades in the future
  and to keep user data separate from the system macros. MicroEmacs
  understands this directory structure.

  The directory structures are defined as:

  __macros__
  
  >  The standard macro distribution, as supplied by JASSPA.

  __spelling__
  
  >  Spelling dictionaries.

  __company__
  
  >  Company wide local definitions for the local site. This directory may
     be omitted if not applicable. Header templates (`.etf` are typically
     copied from the `macro` directory to the `company` directory and modified
     for the local site.

  The search order is defined as `root`, `company`, `macros`, `spelling`.


## UNIX Installation (System Wide) 


  A system wide installation on UNIX for multiple users adheres to
  conventional package installation methods.

  __Distribution Components Required:__

     `jasspa-me-`_<unix>_`-YYYYMMDD.gz`
     `jasspa-metree-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz`
     _<spelling>_`.gz`
     `jasspa-mehtml-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz` (optional)

  __Installation:__
  
  > It is recommended that the macro files are placed in a standard shared
    system directory. The standard directory locations searched by MicroEmacs
    are defined on a per-platform basis, only one of the directory locates is
    selected, as follows:

                                    HP-UX     SunOS      AIX      Cygwin
                               IRIX     UnixWare   ***BSD    Linux      NeXT
     /opt/jasspa:             y    y    y    y    y    y    n    n    n
     /usr/share/jasspa:       y    y    y    y    y    y    y    n    n
     /usr/local/jasspa:       y    y    y    y    y    y    y    y    y
     /usr/local/share/jasspa: n    n    n    n    y    n    n    n    n


  - Create the directory `/usr/local/jasspa`.
  - Unpack and install the `jasspa-metree-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz` into this
        directory.
  - If spelling dictionaries are required then place them in the
        spelling sub-directory created when metree was unpacked. Unpack and
        install the spelling into this directory.
  - If the standard icons are required for Gnome, KDE or some other
        window manager then create the sub-directory /usr/local/jasspa/icons
        and unpack and install the icons into the new directory.
  - Unpack (or build) the executable and place in "`/usr/local/bin`"

  The executable may now be run by all users. If the macros are placed in a
  non-standard directory location then the environment variable
  [MEINSTALLPATH(5)]($MEINSTALLPATH(5)) to define the root jasspa tree.

  For __csh(1)__ users execute a "`rehash`" command and then [me(1)](me(1)) can be executed
  from the command line.

  By default a X-Windows terminal is displayed, ensure that `$DISPLAY` and
  `$TERM` are correctly configured. To execute a terminal emulation then
  execute __me__ with the `-n` option i.e. "`me -n`". Note that this is not required
  if you are using a `vt100` emulation.

  When MicroEmacs is executed the local directory `~/.jasspa` is created for
  the user settings. The user home directory may be changed by setting the
  environment variable [$MEPATH(5)]($MEPATH(5)).


## UNIX Installation (Single User) 


  Where the user is not permitted to install 3rd party applications in the
  system directories then MicroEmacs may be installed locally as follows:-

  - Create the directory `~/.jasspa`.
  - Unpack and install the `jasspa-metree-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz` into this
        directory.
  - If spelling dictionaries are required then place them in the
        spelling sub-directory created when metree was unpacked. Unpack and
        install the spelling into this directory.
  - If the standard icons are required for Gnome, KDE or some other
        window manager then create the sub-directory ~/.jasspa/icons and
        unpack and install the icons into the new directory.
  - The user files will be placed in the `~/.jasspa` directory by default.
        To keep the user macros separate then the directory
        ~/.jasspa/$LOGNAME may be created and will identified as the users
        home directory.
  - Unpack (or build) the executable and place in "`~/bin`"

  MicroEmacs may be executed after it has been re-hashed (depending on the
  shell).


## DOS Installation 


  MS-DOS has no concept of a standard installation directory. The location
  of the MicroEmacs macros is generally determined from the directory
  location of the executable.

  __Executable:__  Compiled with DJGPP V1.0

  Distribution components required:
  
     `jasspa-me-msdos-djgpp1-YYYYMMDD.zip`
     `jasspa-metree-YYYYMMDD.zip`
     _<spelling>_`.zip`

     `mewinhlp.zip` if you are using windows 3.1/3.11

  Recommended installed components:
  
     `grep` - Version of grep (djgpp recommended)
     `make` - Version of make (djgpp recommended)
     `diff` - Version of diff (djgpp recommended)

  __Installation:__
 
  This installation relies on the executable position.

  - Create the directory `c:\jasspa` (or other location)
  - Unpack and install the `jasspa-metree-YYYYMMDD.zip` into this
        directory.
  - If spelling dictionaries are required then place them in the
        spelling sub-directory created when metree was unpacked. Unpack and
        install the spelling into this directory.
  - Unzip the executable and place it in the jasspa root directory
        c:\jasspa.
  - Edit "`c:\autoexec.bat`" and add the following lines:-


            SET PATH=%PATH%;c:\jasspa


  - Reboot the system.
  - MicroEmacs may be run from the command line using __me__.

  __Graphics Cards:__

  MicroEmacs may be configured to the text modes of your graphics card.
  Refer to you graphics card DOS text modes to identify the text modes
  supported by your monitor. The text mode number may be entered into the
  user monitor configuration, defined in __Tools__ -> __User Setup__.

  Running DOS Version From Windows (3.x)
  
  >  The MS-DOS version of MicroEmacs may be executed from a __.pif__ file. Use
     the pif editor to create a new __.pif__ file to launch MicroEmacs. The
     size of the DOS window may be configured from the command line, set
     the terminal size using one of the following command lines:-

                me -c -v$TERM=E80x50        - 80 x 50 window
                me -c -v$TERM=E80x25        - 80 x 25 window.


  >  We usually add the `-c` option so that MicroEmacs is executed with
     history information. This may be omitted if required.


## Microsoft Windows 3.1/3.11 


  __Executable:__  Compiled with Microsoft Developer 2.0

  __Helper DLL:__
 
  Under __Win32s__ a helper DLL __methnk16.dll__ is required to perform the
  [pipe-shell-command(2)](pipe-shell-command(2)) in a synchronous manner. This should be installed
  into the `C:\WINDOWS\SHELL` directory. This (rather inelegantly) gets around
  the problems of spawning a process under __win32s__ due to a number of
  Microsoft bugs in the operating system. Note: that on a spawn operation a
  `MS-DOS` window is visible, this is due to the nature of the command shell
  on this platform which has a tendency to prompt the user at every
  opportunity, hence a certain amount of interaction (which is out of our
  control) is necessary.

  The helper DLL is compiled with a 16-bit Windows compiler - MSVC 1.5.

  __Distribution components required:__

     `jasspa-me-ms-win32s-YYYYMMDD.zip`
     `jasspa-metree-YYYYMMDD.zip`
     `jasspa-mewinhlp-YYYYMMDD.zip`
     _<spelling>_`.zip`

  __Recommended installed components:__

     `4dos` - command shell (giving _stderr_ redirection)
     `grep` - Version of grep (GNU port of grep recommended)
     `diff` - Version of diff (GNU port of grep recommended)
     `make` - use nmake or GNU port of make.

     If__win32s__ is a requirement on this platform, typically taken from
     __pw1118.exe__ which freely available on the Internet.

  __Installation:__
  
  This version of Windows does not have a _install_ directory as '95/'98 and
  it is expected that the `MS-DOS` version will coexist. No _Install_ _Shield_
  installation is provided. Install in a directory structure similar to
  `MS-DOS`. Install the helper DLL __methnk16.dll__ in the `C:\WINDOWS\SHELL`
  directory. Create a [me32.ini(8)](me32.ini(8)) file in the `C:\WINDOWS` directory to
  identify the location of the MicroEmacs 2009 components, this much the
  same as the '95/'98 file, change the directory paths to suite the install
  base.

  __Support Status:__

  The __win32s__ release has not been used with vengeance, although no specific
  problems have been reported with this release.


## Windows 95/98/NT/2K/XP 


  __Executable:__ Compiled with Microsoft Developer 6.x

  __Install Shield__

  >   An __Install Shield__ version of MicroEmacs is available which includes
      all of the distribution components.

  __Distribution components required:__

    `jasspa-mepkg-ms-win32-2004030.zip`

  __Recommended installed components:__

     `grep` - Version of grep (GNU port of grep recommended)
     `diff` - Version of diff (GNU port of grep recommended)
     `make` - use nmake or GNU port of make.

  >  A good source of UNIX native tools is

    ` http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/` - for native windows grep, diff, zip
     etc.
    ` http://www.cygwin.com` - for a shell environment.

  __Installation:__

  - Create the directory "`c:\Program Files\Jasspa\MicroEmacs`" (or other
        location)
  - Create the sub-directory `c:\Program Files\Jasspa\MicroEmacs\macros`.
        Unpack and install the memacros.zip into this directory
  - If spelling dictionaries are required then create the directory
        c:\Program Files\Jasspa\MicroEmacs\spelling. Unpack and install the
        spelling into this directory.
  - Unzip the executable components into "C:\Program
        Files\Jasspa\MicroEmacs"
  - Create a short cut to MicroEmacs for the Desktop

  >  Right click on the desk top

     `=> New`
     `=> Short`
     `=> Command Line: "c:\Program Files\Jasspa\MicroEmacs\me.exe -c"`
     `=> Short Cut Name: "MicroEmacs"`

  >  MicroEmacs may be executed from the shortcut.

  __Open Actions__ Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT provide short cut actions,
  assigning an open action to a file. The short cuts may be installed from
  the __Install Shield__ installation, but may alternatively be explicitly
  defined by editing the registry file with __regedit(1)__.

  A file open action in the registry is bound to the file file extension, to
  bind a file extension _.foo_ to the editor then the following registry
  entries should be defined:-

      [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.foo]
       "MicroEmacs_foo"
      [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MicroEmacs_foo\DefaultIcon]
       "C:\Program File\JASSPA\MicroEmacs\meicons,23"
      [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MicroEmacs_foo\Shell\open]
       "&Open"
      [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MicroEmacs_foo\Shell\open\command]
       "C:\Program File\JASSPA\MicroEmacs\me32.exe -o "%1""


  In the previous example the _DefaultIcon_ entry is the icon assigned to the
  file. This may be an icon taken from `meicons.exe` (in this case icon number
  23), or may be some other icon. The open action in the example uses the __-o__
  option of the _client-server_, which loads the file into the current
  MicroEmacs 2009 session, alternatively the __-c__ option may be used to retain
  the previous context, or no option if a new session with no other files
  loaded is started.

  A generic open for ALL files may be defined using a wild-card, this may be
  used to place a _MicroEmacs_ edit entry in the right-click pop-up menu, as
  follows:-

      [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell]
      [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\MicroEmacs]
       "&MicroEmacs"
      [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\MicroEmacs\command]
       "C:\Program File\JASSPA\MicroEmacs\me32.exe -o "%1""


## ORGANIZING A LOCAL USER PROFILE


  MicroEmacs uses local user configuration profiles to store user specific
  information. The user information may be stored in the MicroEmacs
  directory, or more typically in a users private directory. On login
  systems then the user name and user private directory location is
  automatically determined from the system.

  The user name identified by MicroEmacs is [$user-name(5)]($user-name(5)) this value may be
  set or re-defined using the environment variable [$MENAME(5)]($MENAME(5)). On MS-DOS and
  early windows systems where there is no user login then then [$MENAME(5)]($MENAME(5))
  may be defined in the environment.

  The location of the user information depends upon your platform and
  installation configuration. The private directory identified by MicroEmacs
  is [$user-path(5)]($user-path(5)) this location may be changed by defining the environment
  variable [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)).

  Microsoft Windows users may use the [me32.ini(8)](me32.ini(8)) file to define MicroEmacs
  configuration path and name information.


## User Profile Files 


  Files contained in the user profiles typically include:-

  _<name>_`.emf` - The users start up profile - _<user>_.emf.  
  _<name>_`.edf` - The users spelling dictionary.  
  _<name>_`.erf` - The users registry configuration file.  

  These files are automatically set up by MicroEmacs. These files are
  established from the menu "__Tools__ -> __User Setup__". The "__Setup Path__" item
  defines the location of the files, but must be MANUALLY included in the
  `$MEPATH` environment.


## Company Profiles 


  Company profiles include standard files and extensions to the standard
  files which may be related to a company, this is typically _<company>_.emf
  where _<company>_ is the name of the company.

  The directory may also include template files [etf(8)](etf(8)) files which defines
  the standard header template used in the files. Files in the "`company`"
  directory would over-ride the standard template files.

! 2 CompanyProfiles
## COMPANY PROFILES


  This section describes how a company profile should be incorporated into
  MicroEmacs 2009. A company profile defines a set of extensions to
  MicroEmacs which encapsulate settings which are used on a company wide
  basis. This type of configuration is typically used with a networked
  (shared) installation. The company profile would typically include:-

  - Name of the company.
  - Standard header files including company copyright statements.
  - Standard file layouts
  - Company defined language extensions.


## Location Of The Company Information 


  It is suggested that all of the company extensions applied to MicroEmacs
  2009 are performed in a separate directory location which shadows the
  MicroEmacs standard macro file directory. This enables the original files
  to be sourced if a user does not want to include the company files. This
  method also allows MicroEmacs to be updated in the future, whilst
  retaining the company files.

  The company files are generally placed in the `company` sub-directory
  described in the installation notes.


## Content Of The Company Information 


  __Company macro file__
  
  >  The company file is typically called by the company name (i.e.
     `jasspa.emf`) create a new company file. The file includes your company
     name and hook functions for any new file types that have been defined
     for the company, an example company file for __Jasspa__ might be defined
     as:-

```{.emf}
            ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

! 2 UserProfiles
## USER PROFILES


  This section describes how a user profile should be incorporated into
  MicroEmacs 2009. A user profile defines a set of extensions to MicroEmacs
  which encapsulates settings which are used by an individual user.

  The user profile allows:-

  - Saving of the last session (history), allowing the next invocation
        of MicroEmacs 2009 to restore your previous session. The -c option
        to [me(1)](me(1)) restores a previous sessions buffers to the same state
        prior to exiting the editor.
  - Personalized spelling dictionaries.
  - Redefinition of MicroEmacs 2009 operation, allowing the editor to be
        tailored to an individual's requirements. Including the re-binding
        of keys, modification of the screen colors. Definition of personal
        macros etc.


## Identification 


  In order to identify a user MicroEmacs 2009 uses information in the system
  to determine the name of the user, and in turn the configuration to use.
  On all systems the value of the environment variable [$MENAME(5)]($MENAME(5)) takes
  priority over any other means of user identification. If this variable is
  not defined then the host system typically provides a mechanism to
  determine the current user. MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows systems present
  problems where a login prompt is not used.

  Each of the supported platforms are now described.

  __UNIX__
  
  >  The login name is determined from the `/etc/passwd` file and defines
     [$user-name(5)]($user-name(5)). The environment variable [$MENAME(5)]($MENAME(5)) may be defined
     alter the default user configuration file name.

  __DOS__
 
  >   MS-DOS typically has no concept of the user name. The user name may be
      defined in the `autoexec.bat` file, choose a name of 8 characters or
      less, i.e. to fix the user name to `fred` then add the following line:-

            SET MENAME=fred


  >  Remember to re-boot the system before the new command takes effect.
     (see the next step, there is another change to `autoexec.bat`).

  __Microsoft Windows__

  >  Microsoft windows environments may, or may not, have login enabled. If
     login is enabled then [$user-name(5)]($user-name(5)) is set to the login user name. The
     login name may be overridden by setting the environment variable
     [$MENAME(5)]($MENAME(5)) this may be performed in the environment or through the
     [me32.ini(8)](me32.ini(8)) file.


## Shared Platforms 


  Platforms may share the same set of configuration files. Consider a system
  which may boot under MS-DOS, Windows '98, NT and Linux. Provided that the
  macro files are located on a file system that may be mounted by all of the
  other operating systems and the [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)) and [$MEPATH(5)]($MEPATH(5)) are set
  appropriately to point to the users private MicroEmacs and system
  directories, then a single set of macro files may be shared across all
  platforms.


## Personal MicroEmacs Directory 


  The private user profile is stored in a separate directory. The directory
  that MicroEmacs uses is typically automatically created at start up, but
  may be created manually by the user. If the directory is to be placed in a
  special location then the [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)) environment variable should be
  defined and set to point at this directory location.

  __UNIX__
  
  >  In the UNIX environment then the local directory is typically created
     in the users home directory obtained from the `/etc/passwd` file and is
     called `~/.jasspa`. MicroEmacs will automatically look for this
     directory and set the [$user-path(5)]($user-path(5)) variable to this value. The
     location may be overridden by setting the environment variable
     [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)) to reference a different directory location.

  __DOS__
 
  >  For MS-DOS environments, there is typically no user directory, it is
     suggested that the user directory is created in the MicroEmacs
     directory, use the `$MENAME` defined in the previous step i.e.

            mkdir c:\jasspa\fred


  >  Change or add the environment variable [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)) in the
     __autoexec.bat__ to include the new directory i.e.

            SET MEUSERPATH=c:\jasspa\fred


  __Windows__

  >  In Microsoft Windows environment using Explorer 4.0 or later then a
     user application data directory exists (`$APPDATA`) and MicroEmacs will
     create a directory `jasspa` in this directory location to hold private
     data. If there is no such data area then all user configuration is
     stored in the executable directory location (or a sub-directory called
     [$user-name(5)]($user-name(5))).

  >  The user data area [$user-path(5)]($user-path(5)) may be modified by creating a new
     directory and setting the environment variable [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)) to point
     to this new directory location. The location be specified by a
     __meuserpath__ entry in the [me32.ini(8)](me32.ini(8)) file rather than setting the
     environment variable [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)).


## Creating Your Profile 


  On starting MicroEmacs for the first time then the user is guided through
  the configuration file setup to create any local configuration files. Once
  set up then MicroEmacs may be configured using the [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) dialog:-

      Tools -> User Setup


## The User Profile 


  Files created in the user directory include:-

  - Setup registry and previous session history [$user-name]($user-name(5)).erf (see
     [erf(8)](erf(8))). This stores the user-setup settings and the context from
        previous edit sessions.
  - Users start-up file [$user-name]($user-name(5)).emf (see [emf(8)](emf(8))). This is typically
        referred to as "user.emf" in the documentation and means the users
        private MicroEmacs macro file. The user may make local changes to
        MicroEmacs in this file, this may include definition of new key
        bindings, defining new hook functions etc. You should override the
        standard MicroEmacs settings from your start-up file rather than
        modifying the standard MicroEmacs files.
  - Personal spelling dictionary `lsdp_lang_.edf` (see [edf(8)](edf(8))). Multiple
        spelling dictionaries may be created, one for each language. Any
        words that are added to the spelling dictionary are stored in these
        files.

  In addition to the above, if new private macro files are constructed then
  they should be added to this directory (if they are not global to the
  company).

! 2 Interfacing
## INTERFACING


  This sections describes how MicroEmacs 2009 may be interfaced to external
  components.


## Shells 


  A shell window may be opened within the context of the editor using the
  command [ishell(3)](ishell(3)), whereby an interactive command shell is presented
  within a buffer.

  In the Microsoft Windows environment a __cygwin__ UNIX style BASH shell may be
  realised with the [cygwin(3)](cygwin(3)) command.


## Debugger 


  Within the UNIX environment the GNU __gdb(1)__ or native UNIX __dbx(1)__ debuggers
  may be invoked from the editor using [gdb(3)](gdb(3)) or [dbx(3)](dbx(3)). respectively This
  invokes the debugger and follows the debugging process in the editor
  window, automatically opening the source files as the debugger calls for
  them.


## Microsoft Developer Studio 


  In the Microsoft windows environment, the [memsdev(1)](memsdev(1)) DLL may be attached
  to the __Microsoft Developer Studio__ to enable MicroEmacs 2009 to be used in
  place of the in-built editor.


## File Searching 


  File searching is performed using __grep(1)__ using the [grep(3)](grep(3)) command. For
  Windows then the GNU grep utility is recommended, for MS-DOS then the
  DJGPP version of GNU grep is recommended.


## File Differencing 


  Differencing files, or directories is performed using the __diff(1)__ utility
  using the [diff(3)](diff(3)) command. For all platforms the GNU diff utility is
  recommended as this provides a comprehensive differencing that is not
  typically available with native UNIX diff utilities.


## Tag Files 


  A __tag__ capability exists (see [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2))) such that source functions and
  alike may be located quickly using a __tags__ file. The standard __ctags(1)__
  format is used by MicroEmacs. The __tags__ file itself may be generated by
  MicroEmacs 2009 from the menu (_Tools->XX Tools->Create Tags File_).
  Alternatively a __tags__ file may be generated by the __ctags(1)__ utility. This
  is typically standard on UNIX platforms. For Windows and DOS platforms
  then the __Exuberant Ctags__ is recommended, this is available from:-

     ` http://darren.hiebert.com`

  A MicroEmacs 2009 compatible tags file may be generated using the command
  line "`ctags -N --format=1 ."` cataloging the current directory. To generate
  __tags__ for a directory tree then use "`ctags -NR --format=1 .`". Refer to the
  __Exuberant Ctags__ documentation for a more detailed description of the
  utility.


## Compilation 


  Compilation is performed using the [compile(3)](compile(3)) command. This invokes a
  command shell, typically using __make(1)__ to initiate a build sequence.


## Client-Server 


  The [Client-Server](Client-Server(2)) interface allows other client applications to inject
  commands into an already existing MicroEmacs 2009 session (the server),
  thereby controlling the editor remotely. This is typically used to inject
  new files into the editor to be presented to the user.

  The _Client-Server_ interface is available in both the UNIX and Microsoft
  Windows environments. This mechanism is used in the Microsoft windows
  environment by the [memsdev(1)](memsdev(1)) DLL to attach the __Microsoft Developer Studio__
  to MicroEmacs 2009. This may be used with similar effects within the UNIX
  environments from the X-Window managers desktop in addition to other
  utilities such as __TkDesk(1)__.


## Command Line Filer 


  MicroEmacs may be invoked as a command filter in it's own right, macro
  scripts have been developed to perform a __dos2unix(1)__ conversion operation,
  generate tags files etc. See [Command Line Filters](Command Line Filters).

! 2 Client-Server
## CLIENT-SERVER


  This sections describes how MicroEmacs 2009 may be interfaced to external
  components through the __Client-Server__ interface.

  The __Client-Server__ interface of MicroEmacs 2009 provides a capability for
  other applications to inject commands into a running version of the
  editor, which are interpreted and executed. The interface is only
  available on multi-tasking operating systems such as UNIX and Microsoft
  Windows; it is not available on MS-DOS systems. 

  Within the following discussions, the __Server__ is a running version of the
  MicroEmacs 2009 editor; the __client__ is the application (or shell script)
  that communicates a new command to the _server_.

  The __Client-Server__ interface may provide a bidirectional interface such
  that a _client_ may submit a command to the _server_ and may also retrieve a
  response to that command.


## DESCRIPTION


  The __Client-Server__ interface operates by making an external interface
  available which is continually monitored by the _server_. The external
  interface may be provided by a file, named pipe or socket (depending upon
  the platform) with a well know location in the file system. Typically two
  files are provided, an input file into which the _client_ writes commands
  (_$TEMP___/me___$MENAME___.cmd__); and an output file where responses to those
  commands my be read (_$TEMP___/me___$MENAME___.rsp__).

  Within MicroEmacs, the client server interface appears as a hidden
  [ipipe-shell-command(2)](ipipe-shell-command(2)) buffer, with the name *server*. Commands are
  received through this buffer and responses are written back to the buffer.


## Client Commands 


  _Clients_ may write directly to the _command_ through the use of explicit
  embedded code, or may use a [me(1)](me(1)) invocation with the __-m__ option. Commands
  to the client interface take the form "__C:<client>:<command>__".

  _<client>_
  
  >  _<client>_ is an identification string that may be used to identify the
     client, this information may be used when the command is handled to
     interpret the command if some special client specific action is
     required.

  _<command>_
    
  >  The _<command>_ is an editor command (or macro) of the given name with
     any arguments. Standard command escape sequences must be adhered to.
     i.e. to write "`Hello World`" on the message line then a client may
     issue the command:-

            me -m "C:<client>:ml-write \"Hello world\""


  >  A new line character may be included in the string using `\\n`, if the
     message is not terminated with a new line then on is automatically
     added. The _client-server_ interface is typically used to load a file,
     this may be performed as follows:-

            me -m "C:<client>:find-file \"/path/foo.bar\""


  >  The absolute path is specified in this type of transaction as the
     current working directory of the active MicroEmacs session is unknown.
     The __-m__ option de-iconize's the existing editor session and bring it to
     the foreground.


## Client Responses 


  Responses from _client_ commands are written to the response file, responses
  take a similar form to _client_ commands except they are prefixed by an __R__,
  i.e. "__R:<client>:<data>__".

  As multiple _clients_ may be utilizing the _client-server_ mechanism then the
  _<client>_ sting passed in the command is typically returned in the response
  to allow the _client_ to identify it's own response (rather than any other
  _clients_. It is the _clients_ responsibility that this string is unique in
  order that it may be differentiated. 

  The returned _<data>_ format is undefined and would be generated by a macro
  command used to handle the _client_ command; sufficient to say that the data
  should exist on a single line.


## Server Side 


  On the _server_ side, the __Client-Server__ interface is managed like an
  [ipipe-shell-command(2)](ipipe-shell-command(2)) using the hidden buffer *server* (as previously
  mentioned).

  The _Client-Server_ interface is enabled from the [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) interface,
  the user setting of the interface is confirmed by checking bit `0x20000` of
  the [$system(5)]($system(5)) variable.

  The client server interface is typically initialized within the `me.emf`
  initialization file, whereby the _ipipe_ input handler is bound to the
  client pipe buffer and the buffer is hidden, so it is not available when
  the buffers are swapped. (Note that the client buffer may be explicitly
  interrogated using [find-buffer](next-buffer(2)) `*server*`). The client handler is installed
  as follows:-

```{.emf}
        ; Setup the Client Server
        !if &band $system 0x20000
            define-macro-file meserver server-input
            find-buffer "*server*"
            set-variable :last-line 2
            set-variable :client-list ":"
            set-variable $buffer-ipipe server-input
            beginning-of-buffer
            goto-alpha-mark  "I"
            -1 find-buffer "*server*"
        !endif

```

  This binds a MicroEmacs macro called _server-input_ to handle the client
  commands as they arrive on the input, an [alpha-mark](goto-alpha-mark(2)) is used to record the
  processed position at the end of the buffer. The pipe handler itself
  decodes the client request and executes it. The default handler supplied
  with MicroEmacs 2009 is defined within the macro file `meserver.emf`

  Responses to the client are inserted into the response file by writing
  directly into the ipipe buffer (`*server*`) using the [ipipe-write(2)](ipipe-write(2))
  command. It is the calling macros responsibility to ensure that the
  response string adheres to the format outlined above in the previous
  sections.


## NOTES


  It is not possible to kill the `*server*` buffer, and [ipipe-kill(2)](ipipe-kill(2)) is
  ignored within the context of the buffer.


## FILES


  `meserver.emf` - Default Client-Server ipipe handler.  
  _$TEMP/me$MENAME.cmd_ - Command file.  
  _$TEMP/me$MENAME.rsp_ - Response file.


## BUGS


  The first MicroEmacs 2009 session that executes becomes the editor server,
  additional editor sessions that are executed do not become server
  processes. In the event that the _server_ editor is terminated, any other
  sessions do not take over the role of server. Subsequently issuing a
  client command may fail, or invoke a new editor session which adopts the
  role of server.

## REGULAR EXPRESSIONS


  Regular Expressions are used in the search (and replace) operations. The
  following notes are applicable when [magic(2m)](magic(2m)) mode is enabled.


## Overview 


  A "_regular expression_" (or "_regex_", or "_pattern_") is a text string that
  describes some (mathematical) set of strings. A regex __R__ "_matches_" a string
  __S__ if __S__ is in the set of strings described by __R__.

  Some regular expressions match only one string, i.e., the set they
  describe has only one member. For example, the regular expression '`foo`'
  matches the string '`foo`' and no others. Other regular expressions match
  more than one string, i.e., the set they describe has more than one
  member. For example, the regular expression '`f*`' matches the set of
  strings made up of any number (including zero) of '`f`'s. As you can see,
  some characters in regular expressions match themselves (such as '`f`') and
  some don't (such as '`*`'); the ones that do not match themselves instead
  let you specify patterns that describe many different strings.


## Syntax of Regular Expressions 


  Regular expressions have a syntax in which a few characters are special
  constructs and the rest are "_ordinary_". An ordinary character is a simple
  regular expression which matches that same character and nothing else. The
  special characters are '`$`', '`^`', '`.`', '`*`', '`+`', '`?`', '`[`', '`]`' and '`\`'. Any
  other character appearing in a regular expression is ordinary, unless a
  '`\`' precedes it.

  For example, '`f`' is not a special character, so it is ordinary, and
  therefore '`f`' is a regular expression that matches the string '`f`' and no
  other string. (It does __not__ match the string '`ff`'.) Likewise, '`o`' is a
  regular expression that matches only '`o`'. (When case distinctions are
  being ignored, these regexs also match '`F`' and '`O`', but we consider this a
  generalization of "_the same string_", rather than an exception.)

  Any two regular expressions `A` and `B` can be concatenated. The result is a
  regular expression which matches a string if `A` matches some amount of the
  beginning of that string and `B` matches the rest of the string.

  As a simple example, we can concatenate the regular expressions '`f`' and
  '`o`' to get the regular expression '`fo`', which matches only the string
  '`fo`'. Still trivial. To do something nontrivial, you need to use one of
  the special characters. Here is a list of them.

  __.__ (Period)

  >  is a special character that matches any single character except a
     newline. Using concatenation, we can make regular expressions like
     '`a.b`', which matches any three-character string that begins with '`a`'
     and ends with '`b`'.

  __*__ (asterisk)

  >  is not a construct by itself; it is a postfix operator that means to
     match the preceding regular expression repetitively as many times as
     possible. Thus, '`o*`' matches any number of '`o`'s (including no '`o`'s).

  >  '`*`' always applies to the __smallest__ possible preceding expression.
     Thus, '`fo*`' has a repeating '`o`', not a repeating '`fo`'. It matches '`f`',
     '`fo`', '`foo`', and so on.

  >  The matcher processes a '`*`' construct by matching, immediately, as
     many repetitions as can be found. Then it continues with the rest of
     the pattern. If that fails, backtracking occurs, discarding some of
     the matches of the '`*`'-modified construct in case that makes it
     possible to match the rest of the pattern. For example, in matching
     '`ca*ar`' against the string '`caaar`', the '`a*`' first tries to match all
     three '`a`'s; but the rest of the pattern is '`ar`' and there is only '`r`'
     left to match, so this try fails. The next alternative is for '`a*`' to
     match only two '`a`'s. With this choice, the rest of the regex matches
     successfully.

  >  __+__ (plus) is a postfix operator, similar to '`*`' except that it must
     match the preceding expression at least once. So, for example, '`ca+r`'
     matches the strings '`car`' and '`caaaar`' but not the string '`cr`',
     whereas '`ca*r`' matches all three strings.

  __?__ (question mark)

  >  is a postfix operator, similar to '`*`' except that it can match the
     preceding expression either once or not at all. For example, '`ca?r`'
     matches '`car`' or '`cr`'; nothing else.

  __[__ ... __]__

  >  is a "character set", which begins with '`[`' and is terminated by '`]`'.
     In the simplest case, the characters between the two brackets are what
     this set can match.

  >  Thus, '`[ad]`' matches either one '`a`' or one '`d`', and '`[ad]*`' matches
     any string composed of just '`a`'s and '`d`'s (including the empty
     string), from which it follows that '`c[ad]*r`' matches '`cr`', '`car`',
     '`cdr`', '`caddaar`', etc.

  >  You can also include character ranges in a character set, by writing
     the starting and ending characters with a '`-`' between them. Thus,
     '`[a-z]`' matches any lower-case ASCII letter. Ranges may be intermixed
     freely with individual characters, as in '`[a-z$%.]`', which matches any
     lower-case ASCII letter or '`$`', '`%`' or period.

  >  The word and digit special characters (i.e. `\w`, `\l`, etc.) are
     recognized within the character set.

  >  To include a '`]`' in a character set, you must make it the first
     character. For example, '`[]a]`' matches '`]`' or '`a`'. To include a '`-`',
     write '`-`' as the first or last character of the set, or put it after a
     range. Thus, '`[]-]`' matches both '`]`' and '`-`'.

  >  To include '`^`' in a set, put it anywhere but at the beginning of the
     set.

  >  When you use a range in case-insensitive search, you should write both
     ends of the range in upper case, or both in lower case, or both should
     be non-letters. The behavior of a mixed-case range such as '`A-z`' is
     somewhat ill-defined, and it may change in future Emacs versions.

  __[^__ ... __]__

  >  '`[^`' begins a "_complemented character set_", which matches any
     character except the ones specified. Thus, '`[^a-z0-9A-Z]`' matches all
     characters *__except__* letters and digits.

  >  '`^`' is not special in a character set unless it is the first
     character. The character following the '`^`' is treated as if it were
     first (in other words, '`-`' and '`]`' are not special there).

  >  A complemented character set can match a newline, unless newline is
     mentioned as one of the characters not to match. This is in contrast
     to the handling of regexs in programs such as __grep(1)__.

  __^__ (caret)

  >  is a special character that matches the empty string, but only at the
     beginning of a line in the text being matched. Otherwise it fails to
     match anything. Thus, '`^foo`' matches a '`foo`' that occurs at the
     beginning of a line.

  __$__ (dollar)

  >  is similar to '`^`' but matches only at the end of a line. Thus, '`x+$`'
     matches a string of one '`x`' or more at the end of a line.

  __\\__ (backslash)

  >  has two functions: it quotes the special characters (including '`\`'),
     and it introduces additional special constructs.

  >  Because '`\`' quotes special characters, '`\$`' is a regular expression
     that matches only '`$`', and '`\[`' is a regular expression that matches
     only '`[`', and so on.

  >  __Note:__ for historical compatibility, special characters are treated as
     ordinary ones if they are in contexts where their special meanings
     make no sense. For example, '`*foo`' treats '`*`' as ordinary since there
     is no preceding expression on which the '`*`' can act. It is poor
     practice to depend on this behavior; it is better to quote the special
     character anyway, regardless of where it appears.

  >  For the most part, '`\`' followed by any character matches only that
     character. However, there are several exceptions: two-character
     sequences starting with '`\`' that have special meanings. The second
     character in the sequence is always an ordinary character when used on
     its own. Here is a table of '`\`' constructs.

  >  __\|__ (bar)

  > >  specifies an alternative. Two regular expressions A and B with
       '\|' in between form an expression that matches some text if
       either A matches it or B matches it. It works by trying to match
       A, and if that fails, by trying to match B.

  > >  Thus, 'foo\|bar' matches either 'foo' or 'bar' but no other
       string.

  > >  '\|' applies to the largest possible surrounding expressions. Only
       a surrounding '\( ... \)' grouping can limit the grouping power of
      '\|'.

  > >  Full backtracking capability exists to handle multiple uses of  '\|'.

  >  __\(__ ... __\)__
   
  > >  is a grouping construct that serves three purposes:

  >   * To enclose a set of '\|' alternatives for other
        operations. Thus, '\(foo\|bar\)x' matches either 'foox'
        or 'barx'.
  >   * To enclose a complicated expression for the postfix
        operators '*', '+' and '?' to operate on. Thus,
        'ba\(na\)*' matches 'bananana', etc., with any (zero or
        more) number of 'na' strings.
  >   * To record a matched substring for future reference. This
        last application is not a consequence of the idea of a
        parenthetical grouping; it is a separate feature that is
        assigned as a second meaning to the same '\( ... \)'
        construct. In practice there is no conflict between the
        two meanings.

  >  '__\D__'
     
  > >   matches the same text that matched the Dth occurrence of a `\( ...
        \)' construct.

  > >  After the end of a '\( ... \)' construct, the matcher remembers
       the beginning and end of the text matched by that construct. Then,
       later on in the regular expression, you can use '\' followed by
       the digit D to mean "match the same text matched the Dth time by
       the '\( ... \)' construct."
       
  > >  The strings matching the first nine '\( ... \)' constructs
       appearing in a regular expression are assigned numbers 1 through 9
       in the order that the open-parentheses appear in the regular
       expression. So you can use '\1' through '\9' to refer to the text
       matched by the corresponding '\( ... \)' constructs.
       
  > >  For example, '\(.*\)\1' matches any newline-free string that is
       composed of two identical halves. The '\(.*\)' matches the first
       half, which may be anything, but the '\1' that follows must match
       the same exact text.
       
  > >  If a particular '\( ... \)' construct matches more than once
       (which can easily happen if it is followed by '*'), only the last
       match is recorded.

  >  `\``

  > >  matches the empty string, but only at the beginning of the buffer
       or string being matched against.
       
  > >  NOTE: This currently only matches the start of the current line -
       it does not match the start of the buffer.

  >   `\'`
   
  > >  matches the empty string, but only at the end of the buffer or
       string being matched against.

  > >  NOTE: This currently only matches the end of the current line - it
       does not match the end of the buffer.

  >  `\=`
   
  > >  matches the empty string, but only at point.

  >  `\<`
  
  > >  matches the empty string, but only at the beginning of a word.
       '\<' matches at the beginning of the buffer only if a
       word-constituent character follows.

  >  `\>`
   
  > >  matches the empty string, but only at the end of a word. '\>'
       matches at the end of the buffer only if the contents end with a
       word-constituent character.

  >  `\a`
   
  > >  matches any alpha characters.

  >  `\A`
   
  > >  matches any non-alpha characters.

  >  `\b`
  
  > >  matches the empty string, but only at the beginning or end of a
       word. Thus, '\bfoo\b' matches any occurrence of 'foo' as a
       separate word. '\bballs?\b' matches 'ball' or 'balls' as a
       separate word. '\b' matches at the beginning or end of the buffer
       regardless of what text appears next to it.

  >  `\B`
  
  > >  matches the empty string, but *not* at the beginning or end of a
       word.

  >  `\d`

  > >  matches any digit character.

  >  `\D`

  > >  matches any non-digit character.

  >  `\h`
   
  > >  matches any hexadecimal digit character.

  >  `\H`
   
  > >  matches any non-hexadecimal character.

  >  `\l`
   
  > >  matches any lowercase word-constituent character. The syntax table
       determines which characters these are.

  >  `\L`
  
  > >  matches any character that is not a lowercase word-constituent.

  >  `\m`
   
  > >  matches any alphanumeric characters

  >  `\M`
   
  > >  matches any non alphanumeric characters.

  >  `\s`
   
  > >  matches any white-space character, including new-line.

  >  `\S`
   
  > >  matches any character that is not white-space.

  >  `\u`
  
  > >  matches any uppercase word-constituent character. The syntax table
       determines which characters these are.

  >  `\U`
   
  > >  matches any character that is not a uppercase word-constituent.

  >  `\w`
  
  > >  matches any word-constituent character. The syntax table
       determines which characters these are.

  >  `\W`

  > >  matches any character that is not a word-constituent.

  >  `\{N,M\}`
   
  > >  Matches an integer number of the previous item, where N and M are
       integer constants interpreted as follows:-
      
  > >  \{N\}
           The preceeding item is matched exactly N times.
      
  > >  \{N,\}
           The preceeding item is matched N or more times.
      
  > >  \{N,M\}
           The preceeding item is matched at least N times, but no more
           than M times.
      
  > >  \{,M\}
           The preceeding item is optional and is matched at most M
           times.

  The constructs that pertain to words and syntax are controlled by the
  setting of the syntax table.


## Syntax of Replacement Expressions 


  A regular expression replacement, [query-replace-string(2)](query-replace-string(2)) command (with
  [magic(2m)](magic(2m)) mode enabled), replaces exact matches for a single string or
  pattern. The replacement pattern may be a constant; it may also refer to
  all or part of what is matched by the regular expression search string.

  __\&__
  
  >  In the replacement pattern, __\&__ stands for the entire match being
     replaced. (as does `\0`).

  __\D__

  >  In the replacement pattern, where __D__ is a digit 1-9, stands for
     whatever matched the Dth parenthesized grouping (`\( .. \)`) in search
     pattern. To include a '`\`' in the text to replace with, you must enter
     '`\\`'. For example,

            M-x query-replace-string<RET> c[ad]+r <RET> \&-safe <RET>


  >  replaces (for example) "`cadr`" with "`cadr-safe`" and "`cddr`" with
     "`cddr-safe`".

            M-x query-replace-string<RET> \(c[ad]+r\)-safe <RET> \1 <RET>


  >  performs the inverse transformation.

  >  __\0__
     is a special case, this represents the whole of the search pattern,
     it is equivalent to __\&__.

  __\c___D_

  >  In the replacement pattern capitalizes the string, where _D_ is a digit
     `0-9` or `&`, stands for whatever matched the Dth parenthesized grouping
     (`\(..\)`) in search pattern.

  __\l___D_

  >  In the replacement pattern down-cases the string, where __D__ is a digit
     `0-9` of `&`, stands for whatever matched the Dth parenthesized grouping
     (`\(..\)`) in search pattern.

  __\u___D_

  >  In the replacement pattern up-cases the string, where __D__ is a digit `0-9`
     or `&`, stands for whatever matched the Dth parenthesized grouping
     (`\(..\)`) in search pattern.


## Searching and Case 


  Searching may be either case sensitive or case insensitive, and is
  controlled by the [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) mode. When _exact_ mode is enabled (default) the
  then searches are case sensitive; disabled then case is ignored. The
  [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) mode is set on a per-buffer basis.


## NOTES


  The search engine searches for the longest string that matches a given
  pattern, the longest pattern is sometimes the pattern that is not actually
  required. For instance, consider searching for an HTML bracket set. The
  simplest search is:-

       M-x search-forward "<.*>"

  Unfortunately, this pattern is not specific enough, given an HTML line:-
 
      <a href="www.jasspa.com">Jasspa Site</a>

  Then the pattern matched is actually the whole line as the `.*` matches
  everything to the last `>`, this is the longest string. To rectify the
  pattern then we must be more specific, the correct search pattern to use
  in this instance is:-

      M-x search-forward "<[^>]*>"


  In this case we match any character excluding the closing character, this
  guarantees that we always find the shortest string match. A search of our
  HTML line locates two separate instances of the regular expression <a
  href="www.jasspa.com"> and `</a>`.


## HISTORY


  As of March 2005 then the existing Emacs search string syntax of "`\s?`" and
  "`\S?`" has been discarded in favor of Perl's simpler syntax of "`\s`" and
  "`\S`" for a whitespace character class. Added new character classes "`\d`" =
  digits, "`\D`" != digits "`\h`" = hexdigits "`\H`" != hexdigits "`\l`" = lowercase
  "`\L`" != lowercase "`\u`" = uppercase and "`\U`" != uppercase. The regular
  expression replacement string characters include "`\c#`" "`\l#`" and "`\u#`" to
  change the case of groups.

! 2 Build
## BUILD

## Build since 2024

  The  version  which is on Github  should be build using the  Makefile in the
  root folder of the github project named  linux32gcc.gmk,  macos32gcc.gmk and
  win32mingw.gmk  (this currently  supports  crosscompiling on Linux using the
  Mingw version of the Gcc compiler.
   
  The following executables can be build.
  
  - __mec__  - for  Linux,  MacOS and  Windows - a  terminal  only  version  of
           MicroEmacs  09 which needs the Macro files in a separate  folder for
           full functionality
    
  - __mew__  - for MacOS, Linux and Windows - a Window (X11) based application
           without  console access,  this requires as well the installed Macro
           files, for MacOS and installation of  XQuartz is required
           
  - __mecw__ - for  Linux  and  MacOS - a MicroEmacs 09 version  which runs as a
           X-Windows application but can be used as well as a terminal application 
           if the command line flag `mecw -n` is used, this requires as well the
           installed Macro files and for MacOS the XQuartz package
  
  - __bfs__  - a console  application  which  allows  to  create  standalone
           executables out of _mec_, _mew_ and _mecw_ where the macro files are
           embedded within the executables, as well user macros, the help file
           and dictionaries can be added to the standalone file if the user 
           desires

  - __mecb__ - a bfs  based  standalone executable build from the _mec_ exectuable,
           the Macro files, the help file and the American dictionary

  - __mewb__ - a bfs based standalone  executable  build from the _mew_
           or _mecw_ (Linux, MacOS)  exectuable,  the Macro files, the help file
           and the American dictionary

  - __mecwb__ - a bfs based standalone  executable  build from the _mecw_
           (Linux, MacOS)  exectuable,  the Macro files, the help file
           and the  American  dictionary,  For Windows no such  version can be
           build as applications can be either Console or Window based but not
           both

## Building the Console Version (mec and mecb)

  To build the latest  developer  version  from Github you might start with an
  install of the following tools and libraries:
    
  Linux: git, gcc, make, libz and libncurses libraries  
  Mac: brew (package manager), gcc and make  
  Windows: msys2 (Linux like toolchain), gcc, make, libncurses and libz  

  For a Debian based Linux system like Ubuntu, Linux Mint or MX Linux the
  install steps are then like this:
  
        ### install packages
        sudo apt install git build-essential libz-dev libncurses-dev
        ### fetch repo
        git clone https://github.com/mittelmark/microemacs.git
        cd microemacs
        ### build  mec terminal executable
        make -f linux32gcc.gmk mec  
        ### build  bfs terminal executable
        make -f linux32gcc.gmk bfs/bin
        ### build  mecb terminal executable
        make -f linux32gcc.gmk mecb
          
  You should then have a file like  _mecb-0912XX-linux-KERNEL-DISTRO-VERSION.bin_
  in the current folder. The uppercase letters are replaced with the ME version
  number and the operating system properties.
  
  For Red Hat systems the required  developer  libraries  are  _zlib-devel_  and
  _ncurses-devel_.
  
  Hint: the three build steps can be as well done with one command line:
  
        make -f linux32gcc.gmk mec bfs/bin mecb
        
  TODO: MacOS and Windows (with msys2) build explanations
  
## Building the GUI Version (mew/mecw and mewb/mecwb)

  To  build  the  GUI  version  for  X-Windows  or the  Windows  GUI you  need
  additional libraries for your platforms:
  
  Linux: libxt-dev (Debian based systems) or libXt-devel (Red Hat systems)
  
  You can then compile the mecw and mewb executables like this
  
        make -f linux32gcc.gmk mew mewb

  You should then have a file like  _mewb-0912XX-linux-KERNEL-DISTRO-VERSION.bin_ in the
  current folder
  
  TODO: build MacOS, Windows (with msys2) instructions, the commands are:
  
  MacOS:
  
        make -f macos32gcc.gmk mec bfs/bin mecb
        make -f macos32gcc.gmk mew mewb

  Windows (Cross compiling on Linux):
  
        make -f win32mingw.gmk mec bfs/bin mecb
        make -f win32mingw.gmx mew mewb
          
  For _mecwb_ builds just replace _mew_ with _mecw_ and _mewb_ with _mecwb_.
  
## Build before 2024 or for older Platforms

  This are the old build  instructions which you might try in case you like to
  build for other platforms like other Unix systems or even DOS.
  
  MicroEmacs 2009 may be compiled from the source files using the command
  shell build scripts _build_ (UNIX Bourne Shell) or _build.bat_ (DOS/Windows).
  A default compile sequence may be achieved with a simple:

      build


  from the command line. The build script attempts to detect the host system
  and available compiler and build the editor.

  The build script recognizes the following options:-

  __-C__

  >  Build clean. Delete all of the object files.

  __-d__

  >  Build a debugging version, the output is `med` (or `med32` for 32-bit
     Windows versions).

  __-h__

  >  Display a simple help page

  __-l__ _logfile_

  >  Redirect all compilation output to the _logfile_, this may not work on
     DOS or Windows systems.

  __-la__ _logfile_

  >  Append all compilation output to the end of _logfile_, this may not work
     on DOS or Windows systems.

  __-m__ _makefile_

  >  Build using the specified makefile. over-riding the auto system
     detect. The supplied makefiles include:-

                * aix4.mak IBM AIX 4.x native.

## Makefiles 


  The supplied makefiles are provided in two forms:-

  - __.gmk__ - GNU make, using gcc.
  - __.mak__ - Native make, consistent with the compiler and platform.

  The makefiles are supplied with the following targets:-

  - __all__ - Default build.
  - __clean__ - Removes intermediate files.
  - __spotless__ - Removes intermediate files and any backup files.
  - __me__ - Builds the default MicroEmacs executable.
  - __med__ - Builds a debugging version.
  - __mec__ - Builds a console only version.
  - __mew__ - Builds a windows only version.
  - __mecw__ - Builds a version which supports both console and windows.
  - __ne__ - Builds NanoEmacs executable.


## WINDOWS ENVIRONMENT


  The Windows environment is a little more difficult than UNIX because it
  does not have a good native command line environment. There are two
  Microsoft Developer options for building. If you have not purchased MS-DEV
  then use the FREE Borland compiler which runs on the command line.


## MinGW Build 


  A collection of freely available and freely distributable Windows specific
  header files and import libraries combined with GNU toolsets that allow
  one to produce native Windows programs that do not rely on any 3rd-party C
  runtime DLLs. Available from http://www.mingw.org, __mingw__ allows a
  Microsoft Windows version MicroEmacs to bu built and maintained.


## MS-Dev GUI Build 


  MicroEmacs is supplied with a MS-Dev 6.x project for building. This has
  only been set up for debugging and has limited build options, it will also
  produce a large executable image. The MS-Windows images shipped by JASSPA
  are built using the command line build environment which is detailed in a
  later section.


## MS-Dev Command Line Build 


  The command line build with MS-Dev is a little messy to set up, in the
  following sections we discuss MS-Dev 6.x under Windows 2000. There will be
  differences with different operating systems versions, different install
  paths and different versions of the MS-Dev toolkit. Use the following
  information as an outline ONLY, JASSPA will not take responsibility for
  the configuration of the command line environment, if in doubt then use
  the GUI builder.

  To run __nmake(1)__ from a DOS box then the MS-Dev compiler tools must be
  available in the command path. The MS-Dev kit V6.x is supplied with the
  necessary file to set up the path which is called `VCVARS32.BAT` and is
  typically located in directory:

      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin


  This should be run first and then the command line make files may be run
  using nmake i.e. to build ME:-

      nmake -f win32v6.mak me


  To build NE:-

      nmake -f win32v6.mak ne


  To clean up after:-

      nmake -f spotless


  If you are going to perform a lot of command line building then it is
  easier to set up the environment and not have to run `VCVARS32.BAT` every
  time you compile.

  You can add the variables to your environment, you will need to expand the
  `VCVARS32.BAT` script and then add the results. The following example is for
  MS-Dev 6.0 under W2K, the settings will differ depending on what O/S
  variant you are running and where you have installed software. The
  following ONLY serves as an example, you need to tailor for your
  installation.

  - To set up the variables then __Start__ -> __Settings__ -> __Control__ __Panel__
        which displays the Control Panel items.
  - Select __System__ -> __Advanced__ -> __Environment variables__
  - In __User Variables for__ _<User>_ then __New...__ or __Edit...__ the `PATH`
      variable. Add the command line tools execution paths to the
      environment variable, this will be something like the following (but
      without newlines):-

                Variable Name:  PATH
                Variable Value: %PATH%;
                                C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~3\Common\msdev98\BIN;
                                C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~3\VC98\BIN;
                                C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~3\Common\TOOLS\WINNT;
                                C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~3\Common\TOOLS;

  - Similarly add the `INCLUDE` variable:-

                Variable Name:  INCLUDE
                Variable Value: C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~3\VC98\ATL\INCLUDE;
                                C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~3\VC98\INCLUDE;
                                C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~3\VC98\MFC\INCLUDE;
                                %INCLUDE%

  - Similarly add the `LIB` variable:-

                Variable Name:  LIB
                Variable Value: C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~3\VC98\LIB;
                                C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~3\VC98\MFC\LIB;
                                %LIB%

  - Accept the entries and close down the dialog. Start a new DOS command
     line and the variables should be set up ready for the build.


## NOTES


  Other UNIX ports should be fairly easy from the base set of ported
  platforms. If any new platform ports are performed by individuals then
  please submit the makefiles and any source changes back to JASSPA - see
  [Contact Information](Contact Information).

! 2 localeSupport
## LOCALE SUPPORT


  Locale support within MicroEmacs handles the hardware and software
  configuration with respect to location, including:-

      Displayed Character Set
      Keyboard Support
      Word characters
      Spell Support

  There are many other locale problems which are not addressed in this help
  page. Supporting different locale configurations often requires specific
  hardware (a locale specific keyboard) and knowledge of the language and
  customs of the region. This makes it a very difficult area for one
  localized development team to support, as such, JASSPA rely heavily on the
  user base to report locale issues.


## Note on Names and IDs 


  The language name is not sufficient to identify a locale (Mexican Spanish
  is different to Spanish Spanish) neither is the country name (two
  languages are commonly used in Belgium), so before we've really started
  the first problem of what to call the locale has no standard answer! Call
  it what you like but please try to call it something meaningful so others
  may understand and benefit from your work.

  In addition, the _internal id_ and _data file_ names have a length limit of
  just four characters due to the "`8.3`" naming conversion of MS-DOS. The
  standard adopted by JASSPA MicroEmacs for the internal locale id is to
  combine the 2 letter ISO language name (ISO 639-1) with the 2 letter ISO
  country name (ISO 3166-1). Should the locale encompasses more than one
  country, then the most appropriate _country id_ is selected.


## Displayed Character Set


  A character set is the mapping of an integer number to a display symbol
  (i.e. character). The ASCII standard defines a mapping of numbers to the
  standard English characters, this standard is well defined and accepted,
  as a result the character set rarely causes a problem for plain English.

  Problems occur when displaying characters found outside the ASCII
  standard, such as letters with accents, letters which are not Latin based
  (e.g. Greek alphabet) and graphical characters (used for drawing dialog
  boxes etc.). There are many different character sets to choose between and
  if the wrong character set is selected then the incorrect character
  translation is performed resulting in an incorrect character display. If
  the character display looks incorrect then first try changing the font and
  character-set setting, these can be configured using the platform page of
  [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)).

  If the problem persists (i.e. because the character set used to write the
  text is not supported on your current system) use the [charset-change(3)](charset-change(3))
  command to convert the text to the current character set.

  If your character-set is not supported then first make sure that
  MicroEmacs will draw all of the characters to be used. By default
  MicroEmacs does not draw some characters directly as the symbol may not be
  defined. When a character is not defined then there will typically be a
  gap or space in the text at the unknown character, in some cases there may
  be no space at all which will make it very hard to use. The
  [insert-symbol(3)](insert-symbol(3)) command (Edit->Insert Symbol) is a good way of looking at
  which characters can be used with the current character set.

  For a character to be rendered (when in main text) or poked (drawn by
  [screen-poke(2)](screen-poke(2)) or [osd(2)](osd(2))) is defined by the [set-char-mask(2)](set-char-mask(2)) command. The
  characters that are used when drawing MicroEmacs's window boarders or __osd__
  dialogs is set via the [$box-chars(5)]($box-chars(5)) and [$window-chars(5)]($window-chars(5)) variables.

  MicroEmacs attempts to improve the availability of useful graphics
  characters on Windows and UNIX X-Term interfaces. The characters between 0
  and 31 are typically control characters with no graphical representation
  (e.g. new-line, backspace, tab etc.) if bit 0x10000 of the [$system(5)]($system(5))
  variable is set then MicroEmacs renders its own set of characters. These
  characters are typically used for drawing boxes and scroll-bars.

  With so many character sets, each with their own character mappings, then
  the problem of spelling dictionary support is also tied to the locale.
  MicroEmacs uses the ISO standard character sets (ISO 8859) internally for
  word and spelling support and therefore a mapping between the ISO standard
  and the user character set is required. This mapping is defined by using
  the '`M`' flag of the [set-char-mask(2)](set-char-mask(2)) command.

  The user may declare the current character set in the platform page of
  [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)). All the settings required for supporting each character set
  may be found in the `charset.emf` macro file, so if your character set is
  not supported, this is the file to edit.


## Keyboard Support


  The keyboard to character mapping is defined in the Start-Up page of
  [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)), where the keyboard may be selected from a list of known
  keyboards. If your keyboard is not present, or is not working correctly,
  then this section should allow you to fix the problem (please send JASSPA
  the fix).

  Most operating systems seem to handle keyboard mappings with the exception
  of MS-Windows which requires a helping hand. The root of the problems with
  MS-Windows is it's own locale character mappings which change the
  visibility status of the keyboard messages which conflict with Emacs
  keystroke bindings. To support key-bindings like '`C-tab`' or '`S-return`' a
  low level keyboard interface is required, but this can lead to strange
  problems with the more obscure keys, particularly with the '`Alt Gr`'
  accented letter keys. For example on American keyboards pressing '`C-#`'
  results in two '`C-#`' key events being generated, this peculiarity only
  occurs with this one key. On a British keyboard the same key generates a
  '`C-#`' followed by a '`C-\`'.

  This problem can be diagnosed using the [$recent-keys(5)]($recent-keys(5)) variable. Simply
  type an obvious character, e.g. '`A`' then the offending key followed by
  another obvious key ('`B`'), then look for this key sequence in the
  __$recent-keys__ variable (use the [list-variables(2)](list-variables(2)) or [describe-variable(2)](describe-variable(2))
  command). So for the above British keyboard problem the recent-keys would
  be:

            B C-\\ C-# A


  ($recent-keys lists the keys backwards). Once you have found the key
  sequence generated by the key, the problem may be fixed using the
  [translate-key(2)](translate-key(2)) to automatically convert the incorrect key sequence into
  the required key. For the problem above the following line is required:

```{.emf}
        translate-key "C-# C-\\" "C-#"

```

  Note that once a key sequence has been translated everything, including
  __$recent-keys__, receive only the translated key. So if you a suspected a
  problem with the existing definition, change the keyboard type in
  __user-setup__ to __Default__ so no translations are performed, quit and restart
  MicroEmacs before attempting to re-diagnose the problem.

  All the settings required for supporting each keyboard may be found in the
  `keyboard.emf` macro file, so if your keyboard is not supported, this is the
  file you need to edit.


## Word characters


  Word characters are those characters which are deemed to be part of a
  word, numbers are usually included. Many MicroEmacs commands use the
  'Word' character set such as [forward-word(2)](forward-word(2)) and [upper-case-word(2)](upper-case-word(2)). The
  characters that form the word class are determined by the language being
  used and this can be set in the Start-Up page of [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)).

  If your language is not supported you will need to add it to the list and
  define the word characters, these settings may be found in the
  `language.emf` macro file. The '`a`' flag of command [set-char-mask(2)](set-char-mask(2)) is used
  to specify whether a character is part of a word, you must specify the
  uppercase letter and then the lowercase equivalent so the case conversion
  functions work correctly.

  A list of characters to be removed from the word character set is stored
  in the __.set-char-mask.rm-chars__ variable. This is done so that the language
  may be changed many times in the same session of MicroEmacs without any
  side effects (such as the expansion of the word character set to include
  all letters of all languages). This makes MicroEmacs ideal for writing
  multi-language documents.

  This may unfortunately be made a little more tricky by the requirement
  that this list must be specified in the most appropriate ISO standard
  character set (see __Displayed Character Set__ section). When extending the
  word character set the characters have to be mapped to the current
  character set which may not support all the required characters. For
  example in the PC-437 DOS character set there is an e-grave (``e`) but no
  E-grave so the E-grave is mapped to the normal E. As a result, if trying
  to write French text the case changing commands will behave oddly, for
  example:

            r`egle -> REGLE -> r`egl`e


  The conversion of all '`E`'s to '``e`' is an undesirable side effect of '``E`'
  being mapped to `E`. This can be avoided by redefining the base letter again
  at the end of the word character list, for example:

```{.emf}
        set-char-mask "a" "`E`eEe"

```

## Spell Support


  The current language is set using the Language setting on General page of
  [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)), if your required language is not listed you must first
  create the basic language support by following the guide lines in the Word
  Character section above. If you Language is listed, select it and enable
  it by either pressing __Current__ or saving and restarting MicroEmacs. in a
  suitable test buffer run the [spelling checker](spell-buffer(3)), one of three things will
  happen:

  The `Spelling Checker` dialog opens and spelling is checked

  >  The spelling checker is supported by the current language and can be
     used (the rules and dictionaries have been downloaded and installed).

  > Dialog opens with the following error message:

            Rules and dictionaries for language "XXXX"
               are not available, please download.


  >  The spelling checker is supported by the current language but the
     required rules and dictionaries have not been downloaded. You should
     be able to download them from the JASSPA website, see [MicroEmacs - Contact Information](Contact Information)lmContactln
     Once downloaded they must be placed in the MicroEmacs
     [search path]($search-path(5)), i.e. where the other macro files (like me.emf) are
     located.

  > Dialog opens with the following error message:

            Language "XXXX" not supported!


  >  The spelling checker is not supported by the current language, see the
     following __Adding Spell Support__ section.


## Adding Spell Support 


  To support a language MicroEmacs's spelling checker requires a base word
  dictionary and a set of rules which define what words can be derived from
  each base word in the dictionary. The concept and format of the word list
  and rules are compatible with the __Free Software Foundation__ GNU __ispell(1)__
  package.

  The best starting point is to obtain __ispell__ rules and word lists in plain
  text form, the web can usually yield these. Once these have been obtained
  the rules file (or affix file) must be converted to a MicroEmacs macro
  file calling the [add-spell-rule(2)](add-spell-rule(2)) command to define the rules. The rule
  file should be named "`lsr`_<lang-id>_`.emf`" where "_<lang-id>_" is the spelling
  language id, determined by the __.spell.language__ variable set in the
  `language.emf` macro file.

  The `spellutl.emf` macro file contains the command __spell-conv-aff-buffer__
  which will attempt to convert the buffer but due to formatting anomalies
  this process often goes wrong so using the command __spell-conv-aff-line__
  (also contained in `spellutl.emf`) to convert a single line is often
  quicker. See existing spelling rule files (`lsr*.emf`) for examples and help
  on command [add-spell-rule(2)](add-spell-rule(2)).

  __Note__: the character set used by the rules should be the most appropriate
  ISO standard (see __Displayed Character Set__ section), this can make the
  process much more difficult if the current character set not compatible,
  if you are having difficulty with this please e-mail [JASSPA Support](MicroEmacs - Contact Information).

  Once the rules have been created, create a dictionary for the language
  from the word lists, see help on command [add-dictionary(2)](add-dictionary(2)). The dictionary
  file name should be "`lsdm`_<lang-id>_`.edf`", if the dictionary is large and
  can be split into two sections, a set of common words and a set of more
  obscure ones, create two dictionaries calling the dictionary containing
  obscure words "`lsdx`_<lang-id>_`.edf`" and the other as above.

  Once the generated word and dictionary files have been place in the
  MicroEmacs [search path]($search-path(5)), the spelling checker should find and use them.
  Please submit your generated support to MicroEmacs for others to benefit.

! 1 Patching
## PATCHING


  This page describes how to patch a MicroEmacs installation with a later
  release without re-installing.


## Windows 


  Windows requires careful patching in order not to disturb the registry
  settings The following procedure should be followed.

  - Move to the jasspa directory, `c:\ProgramFiles\JASSPA\Microemacs`.
  - COPY the executable `me32.exe` to a backup, you MUST copy the file
          otherwise the registry settings will change. DO NOT MOVE THE FILE.

                copy me32.exe me32_2002_12.exe

  - Save the macros directory, these may be moved i.e.

                rename macros macros_2002_12

  - Unpack and install the new Windows executable and COPY over the
    original executable that was previously backed up i.e.

                copy c:\path-to-executable\me32-win32-20040108-rc1.exe me32.exe

  - Create a new macros directory and install the macros into this new
    directory, do this manually or using a utility like WINZip.

                mkdir macros
                cd macros
                unzip c:\path-to\memacros-20040108-rc1.zip

  - The new version of MicroEmacs will now operate with the old
    installation environment. You may return to the old release by
    reversing the steps to patch the installation.


## UNIX/Linux 


  For __*NIX__ package installations then patching is a little easier. The steps
  are defined as follows:-

  - Move to the jasspa directory.

                cd /opt/jasspa/bin

  - Save the original executable.

                mv me me_200212

  - Unpack the new executable and make it executable.

                gunzip me-sun-solaris-20040108-rc1.gz
                mv me-sun-solaris-20040108-rc1 me
                chmod a+x me

  - Save the existing macros directory.

                cd /opt/jasspa
                mv macros macros_200212

  - Create a new macros directory and install the new macros:-

                mkdir macros
                cd macros
                unzip /path-to/memacros-20040108-rc1.zip

  - Installed packages are built with the install path built into the
    executable, this may be different from the patch version of the
    executable so the environment variable [$MEINSTALLPATH(5)]($MEINSTALLPATH(5)) may be
    defined in the environment with the macro installation search paths.

## MACROS


  __MicroEmacs__ is based on a core set of built in commands and variables that
  provide a a basic set of functionality, almost all of the visible features
  of MicroEmacs are implemented or controlled by its macro language.  
  __NanoEmacs__ is quite simply this base set of commands of MicroEmacs with no
  macro support and provides a basic Emacs editor.

  MicroEmacs is extended with an interpreted script file that allows new
  commands to be defined using the base level commands and variables which
  is referred to as a Macro. Once a macro command has been defined then it
  appears as a built in command to the user, and as with the existing
  commands, may have a key binding to invoke the new command.

  In addition to the base commands, the macro language includes control
  statements and logical operators which allow loops and conditional command
  sequences to control the sequence of operations.


## Starting to write Macros 


  For new users to MicroEmacs writing macros can be quite daunting, some of
  the macros shipped with MicroEmacs are complex and have evolved over many
  years. Beginners should start with simple macros which has verifiable
  output and can be performed interactively. This makes the task of writing
  and testing easier, some of the _behind the scene_ macros like the mouse
  driver and auto-spell checker are difficult to get working and requires a
  greater understanding of MicroEmacs and experience in macro debugging. 

  A good starting point is to try to write a macro to do something that you
  find yourself doing all the time, for example reread-file, write-region
  etc.

  __Escape Sequences__

  >  The backslash character '`\`' is an escape sequence in MicroEmacs macro
     files, therefore any backslash character that appears in a macro
     command must be also escaped. i.e. '\' will become '\\' when placed in
     a macro file.

  __Editor Control__

  >  Remember when you write a macro you are placing the editor in control
     of your macro, when testing a new macro then start a new MicroEmacs
     session or make sure that if things go wrong you will not loose any
     work. If you loose control of the editor then __abort__ (`C-g`) will
     typically regain control again.


## Developing your First Macro 


  In the following example then we walk through the steps to create a macro
  that saves a region of text to a file (i.e. the text between __point__ and
  __mark__). The resultant macro will be called __write-region__, note that this
  macro already exists in MicroEmacs.

  The first thing to do is walk through the macro that you wish to write
  interactively in MicroEmacs. Whilst doing this you should decide which
  approach to take and the commands (or keys) used. Our __write-region__ could
  either use narrows or copy the region to a temporary buffer, a decision
  has to be made which approach is best to use. Narrows would be more
  efficient but there are more complications (such as restoring edit mode,
  avoid changing the __undo__ stack etc.). For the moment then the temporary
  buffer approach is probably the best solution.

  Walking through the sequence of steps required to save a region of text
  then the following command sequence would be executed (assuming a marked
  up region has been selected):-

      esc w                       ; Copy the region.
      C-x b "tmp-buffer"          ; Create a new temporary buffer.
      C-y                         ; Yank copied region into temporary buffer.
      C-x C-w "write_region_file" ; Save the buffer to a file.
      C-x k RETURN                ; Kill the temporary buffer.


  This is a fairly easy sequence of steps, the history of key presses can be
  viewed in the variable [$recent-keys(5)]($recent-keys(5)), the command [list-variables(2)](list-variables(2))
  includes this variable in its output.

  Macros are not written in key sequences, instead the commands associated
  with the key bindings are used. A key binding command name may be
  determined using [describe-key(2)](describe-key(2)) and [describe-bindings(2)](describe-bindings(2)). Some command
  bindings include a numeric argument, the numeric argument is important
  (both the value and absence/presence of the argument) and can change the
  behavior of the command. `C-up` is not __backward-line__, it is _5_ __backward-line__ 
  to go back 5 lines, if you supply a numerical value to the command
  as well, e.g. `esc 3 C-up` you must multiply the user argument with
  the numerical argument of the binding:

      3 up   -> 3   'backward-line' -> 3 * 1 backward-line ->  3 backward-line
      3 C-up -> 3 '5 backward-line' -> 3 * 5 backward-line -> 15 backward-line


  Translating the keys that we used into commands then our __write-region__
  process becomes:-

```{.emf}
        copy-region
        find-buffer "tmp-buffer"
        yank
        write-buffer "write_region_file"
        delete-buffer RETURN

```

  __TIP:__
 
  >  If you are in an MicroEmacs macro buffer (e.g. `foo.emf`) use the
     __emf-quote-command__ command (bound to `A-q`) to make this process trivial.
     This converts the key binding into a command which is inserted into
     the buffer.

  The obvious problem here is the last line, `delete-buffer RETURN`. When
  running interactively you can simply press RETURN to delete the current
  buffer however you cannot do this in a macro so you must explicitly
  specify the buffer name to delete:

```{.emf}
        delete-buffer  "write_region_file"

```

  The the process of writing the buffer has the side effect of changing the
  buffer name to reflect the output file name, as __delete-buffer__ follows the
  __write-buffer__ then the name will have changed.

  Correcting the delete buffer name, the sequence of commands is wrapped
  with a macro definition, which binds a name to the command sequence, and a
  terminator which terminates the macro.

```{.emf}
        define-macro write-region
            copy-region
            find-buffer "tmp-buffer"
            yank
            write-buffer "write_region_file"
            delete-buffer "write_region_file"
        !emacro

```

  This macro works but is not very effective as the output filename has been
  fixed, this creates a file "`write_region_file`" in the MicroEmacs start up
  directory - probably not what is required. The specific macro that has
  been created must be made interactive, this means it must get filenames
  from the user, cope with a failure and the user doing silly things. So
  what must we cope with ? The list of defects is surprisingly long
  considering we are doing so little:

  1. The temp buffer used ("`tmp-buffer`") is not a temporary buffer,
     temporary buffers must always commence with a '`*`' and should be
     identifiable with the generating macro. __Note:__ knowledge that a buffer
     is temporary allows MicroEmacs to discard content when shutting down
     without prompting the user to save.
  2.
     What happens if the "`tmp-buffer`" already exists ?
  3.
     What happens if the "`write_region_file`" buffer already exists ?
  4.
     We need to get the filename to write from the user.
  5.
     What happens if the user aborts during the macro ?
  6.
     What happens if the write fails (disk full or file exists etc.) ?
  7.
     What happens if the user has the current buffer displayed in more than
     one window ?
  8.
     Does this fit in with other MicroEmacs commands amd macros ? Do we
     want to use this new command from another context ?


  The list of issues is a re-occurring theme, once you have got the hang of
  this it does become easier. In short reliable macros must:

  - Check inputs
  - Check outputs
  - Handle errors
  - Where appropriate handle an unexpected failure.

  The last one is really reserved for low level drivers (i.e. mouse,
  directory listings etc.) which must be bomb proof.


## Generalising Macros 


  In the previous section we have created a basic macro to save a region of
  text, in this section we look at that macro is transformed from a static
  sequence to commands to a fully interactive robust command. Reference
  should be made to [MicroEmacs Macro Language at a Glance](macroOverview(4)) for a quick tour
  of the language syntax.


## 1. The temp buffer used is not a temporary buffer... 


  Forming a temporary buffer is simply a naming issue, temporary buffer
  names are simply started with a "`*`", by convention for a simple buffer
  name then they are terminated with a "`*`" as well. The temporary buffer
  name should reflect the name of the original macro hence the buffer name
  should be something like `*write-region-tmp*`

```{.emf}
        define-macro write-region
            copy-region
            find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            yank
            write-buffer "write_region_file"
            delete-buffer "write_region_file"
        !emacro

```

## 2. What happens if the 'tmp-buffer' already exists ? 


  Looking at the current implementation if the write fails the temporary
  buffer will be left lying around. This is very likely to happen and if it
  does then we will get the last region as well as the next region in the
  output file. The simple solution is to delete the temporary buffer first,
  our first attempt to correct this:

```{.emf}
        define-macro write-region
            copy-region
            delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            ....
        !emacro

```

  Unfortunately this fails if the buffer does not exist, so we must tell
  MicroEmacs to ignore the failure by __forcing__ the execution:

```{.emf}
        define-macro write-region
            copy-region
            !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            yank
            write-buffer "write_region_file"
            delete-buffer "write_region_file"
        !emacro

```

## 3. What happens if the 'write_region_file' buffer already exists ? 


  If the `write_region_file` buffer already exists the buffer being written is
  renamed to `write_region_file<1>` rather than `write_region_file` and so
  the __delete-buffer__ command will delete the wrong buffer. Therefore rather than
  delete an explicitly named buffer the environment variables are used to
  query the name of the current buffer. The variable [$buffer-bname(5)]($buffer-bname(5))
  returns the current buffer's buffer name and may be used instead of an
  explicit name.

```{.emf}
        define-macro write-region
            copy-region
            !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            yank
            write-buffer "write_region_file"
            delete-buffer $buffer-bname
        !emacro

```

  Macro variables may be used to get just about any information you could
  possibly want. For example [$buffer-fname(5)]($buffer-fname(5)) could be used after the
  __buffer-write__ to get the file name, [$window-line(5)]($window-line(5)) provides the current
  line number etc. See

      Help -> [Variable Glossary](Variable Glossary)

  for a full list of system variables. There are also __Macro Variables__
  (`@`,`#`,...) which are also very useful, e.g. [@wl](CurrentBufferVariables(4)) gives the text on the
  current line as a string, see the [Macro Language Glossary](Macro Language Glossary) for a full list
  of these and other macro features such as functions and directives.


## 4. We need to get the destination filename from the user. 


  Getting input from the user is always dangerous, most macros run so
  quickly that the user will not have sufficient time to abort the process
  (`C-g`) and if they do there is not much that can be done. When collecting
  input from the user the macro must wait for some input, at this point the
  user can and should be able to abort the process which must be handled. If
  the user has not aborted the user still has this uncanny ability of doing
  the unexpected and the input has to be checked, better still get
  MicroEmacs to get the input and check it.

  There are two approaches to the input problem:

  - We get the filename ourselves and pass this to the __write-buffer__
        command.
  - Make __write-buffer__ get the input from the user itself as the command
        would when run from the command key binding.

  We would need to use the first approach if we needed the entered value
  multiple times, in this case we are not so we can use the simpler second
  approach but for the sake of this document lets consider the first
  approach.

  First stab:

```{.emf}
        set-variable $write-region-file-name @ml "Write-region file"
        write-buffer $write-region-file-name

```

  This does work but you really do not want to do this ! Consider what
  happens if the user aborts while entering the file name ? The user would
  be left in the "`*write-buffer-tmp*`" buffer and would have to clear up the
  mess themselves. This may be fixed by catching the abort from the input
  and deleting the buffer.

```{.emf}
        !force !force set-variable $write-region-file-name @ml "Write-region file"
        !if &not $status
            !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
            !abort
        !endif
        write-buffer $write-region-file-name

```

  __NOTE:__
 
  >  The call to [set-variable](set-variable(2)) requires a double [!force](!force(4)), a single __!force__
     allows a macro to continue after a failed command but not after a user
     interrupt (i.e. a `C-g` abort), to continue after this requires a double
     __!force__.

  The second problem is with the input type, the [@ml](MessageLineVariables(4)) does not indicate that
  a file name is required. The type of input should be qualified to first
  check the input type and to provide other features such as file completion
  on file name entry. Specifying the input type correctly:

```{.emf}
        !force !force set-variable $write-region-file-name @ml04 "Write-region file"
        !if &not $status
            !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
            !abort
        !endif
        write-buffer $write-region-file-name

```

  __TIP:__
 
  >  How did we find out about [@ml04](MessageLineVariables(4)) ? The best way to find out how to do
     something is find another macro (or command) that does something very
     similar and copy it, in this case the [diff](diff(3)) macro has to perform a
     similar operation. If you cannot find anything then look in the
     command documents, the documents generally provide this sort of
     information (for example see [@ml(4)](@ml(4))). If all else fails then use the
     News Group, somebody will be able to provide an answer to your
     question.

  In progressing through the example we have used the basic system variables
  (`$var`) as they are simple. Other variables exist: user (`%var`), buffer
  (`:var`) or command (`.var`). All of the previously mentioned variables use
  valuable system resource and consideration should be given as to whether
  the value is required once the macro has completed execution. In our case
  the file name is temporary and is not required outside of the scope of the
  macro, rather than waste memory then a register variable is preferred as
  they have zero cost and execute faster than the other variables.
  Re-writing the macro with register (`#lx`) variables:

```{.emf}
        !force !force set-variable #l1 @ml04 "Write-region file"
        !if &not $status
            !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
            !abort
        !endif
        write-buffer #l1

```

  __TIP:__
 
  >  Avoid using the global variables (`#g1` etc.) as these could be altered
     by other macros. Sub-macros (i.e. macros called by other macros) can
     pass values back to their calling macro via the parent's register
     variables (`#p1` etc.). When using parent register variables then ensure
     that the sub-macro does not destroy some context of the parent macro
     through altering a register variable that has been used for another
     purpose.

  At the start of this section we said that there were two techniques by
  which we could get user input, we selected the first (which was less
  desirable than the second). The approach that we have taken of passing the
  filename to __write-buffer__ appears to be correct, however the __write-buffer__
  command probably expects a reasonable filename -- what happens if the user
  enters a directory name ? There are other potential esoteric problems with
  our current approach, all of which may be overcome, but not here.

  The second technique, which is by far the best solution, is to simply get
  the command [write-buffer(2)](write-buffer(2)) to get its input directly from the user. The
  command does this by default when bound to a key and run from the command
  line however when run from a macro the behavior is different as there is
  no command line. We can force this behavior by asking the command to be
  executed as if it were run from the command line:-

```{.emf}
        write-buffer @mn

```

  When __write-buffer__ asks the MicroEmacs macro processor for a file name the
  [@mn](MessageLineVariables(4)) argument tells it to go directly to the user even though ME is
  currently running a macro. This will only get a single argument from the
  user, if the file already exits __write-buffer__ asks for confirmation that
  over-writing the existing file is okay, but this argument has not been
  given so the command fails. To fix this we could do:

```{.emf}
        write-buffer @mn "y"

```

  However this has now created even more issues, what happens if this file
  is already loaded into MicroEmacs, should we allow the user to decide ? We
  could allow the command line to handle all of the cases:

```{.emf}
        write-buffer @mn @mn @mn @mn ....

```

  Which is rapidly becoming very messy for each individual argument, instead
  we use [@mna](MessageLineVariables(4)) to ask the command to handle all input associated with the
  command:

```{.emf}
        write-buffer @mna

```

  Note that we should have used this for the first method to protect
  __write-buffer__:

```{.emf}
        write-buffer #l1 @mna

```

  In this case the file name is provided by the argument `#l1` but the
  remaining arguments are handled internally by the command itself as if
  invoked from the command line.

  Moreover, there is one subtle problem here that can cause a lot of
  problems especially for other macros trying to use this macro (uses tend
  to spot the problem themselves and correct it causing only minor
  frustration). The macro creates a new temporary buffer which has no file
  name, this means that saving to "`./file`" will write the region to "`file`"
  in the startup directory rather than in the current buffer's file path.
  For example, if you start MicroEmacs from "`/bin`", load file "`/tmp/foo.txt`"
  and `write-region` "`./bar.txt`" you will create the file "`/bin/bar.txt`" not
  "`/tmp/bar.txt`".

  To solve this directory issue the file name of the temporary buffer has to
  be set to the same filename as the current buffer we are copying from.
  This is safe as this is a temporary buffer (starts with a '`*`') so
  MicroEmacs will not attempt to auto save or allow the buffer to be saved
  using [write-buffer](write-buffer(2)) and is performed as follows:

```{.emf}
        define-macro write-region
            copy-region
            set-variable #l0 $buffer-fname       ; ADDED to fix directory location
            !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            yank
            set-variable $buffer-fname #l0       ; ADDED to fix directory location
            write-buffer @mna
            delete-buffer $buffer-bname
        !emacro

```

  After all of that, the solution is in fact very simple, however the
  underlying complexity of the user expectations as to the behavior of the
  command are complicated.


## 5. What happens if the user aborts during the macro ? 


  This issue has already been touched on in the previous sections, by using
  the __@mna__ only the __write-buffer__ is likely to be aborted while the user is
  prompted for a file name etc. and if the user manages to abort elsewhere
  there really is not much that can be done about it without severely
  impacting the complexity of the macro. Practically it is only necessary to
  catch the exception when the user is being prompted on the command line
  with __write-buffer__, as with our existing user input a double __!force__ is
  required to catch an abort at a prompt.

```{.emf}
        define-macro write-region
            copy-region
            set-variable #l0 $buffer-fname
            !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            yank
            set-variable $buffer-fname #l0
            !force !force write-buffer @mna
            !if &not $status
                !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
                !abort
            !endif
            delete-buffer $buffer-bname
        !emacro

```
  The [$status(5)]($status(5)) variable allows us to catch the exit state of the forced
  command and test for an abort condition following the forced statement.
  Note that the __$status__ value is only valid immediately after the last
  executed command, executing another command changes the value of __$status__.
  If the status is required after execution of another command then it may
  be saved in a variable and used later.


## 6. what happens if the write fails (disk full or file exists etc) ? 


  As the __write-buffer__ command should handle write file failures sensibly,
  and we have enabled it to get input from the user, then the command will
  automatically handle the failure conditions. Within our macro then it is
  simply a case of detecting and handling the failure condition -- we have
  already done this by handling the user input so no additions are required
  to the macro.


## 7. What happens if the current buffer displayed in more than one window ? 


  If the user has the current buffer displayed only once then the action of
  deleting the temporary buffer returns the current window to the previous
  buffer, as required. If however the buffer is displayed more than once
  then when the temporary buffer is deleted MicroEmacs will select a
  different non-displayed buffer to become the current window (unless this
  is the only buffer) and so the user will not be returned back to their
  original buffer.

  This may be fixed by storing the initial buffer name and explicitly
  returning to it after the __delete-buffer__:

```{.emf}
        define-macro write-region
            copy-region
            set-variable #l0 $buffer-fname
            set-variable #l1 $buffer-bname
            !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            yank
            set-variable $buffer-fname #l0
            !force !force write-buffer @mna
            !if &not $status
                !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
                find-buffer #l1
                !abort
            !endif
            delete-buffer $buffer-bname
            find-buffer #l1
        !emacro

```

  However, when there are two windows into the same buffer the command may
  inherit the other window's buffer location, i.e. if the current window is
  on line 100 and the other window display this buffer is at line 200 the
  above version will leave the user at line 200 and a different region. The
  commands [set-position(2)](set-position(2)) and [goto-position(2)](goto-position(2)) allow the current position
  to be saved and later restored, the commands both take a single character
  which identifies the saved position, this allows multiple positions to be
  saved. Re-writing our macro to save and restore the buffer position we
  get:

```{.emf}
        define-macro write-region
            copy-region
            set-variable #l0 $buffer-fname
            set-position "P"
            !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            yank
            set-variable $buffer-fname #l0
            !force !force write-buffer @mna
            !if &not $status
                !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
                goto-position "P"
                !abort
            !endif
            delete-buffer $buffer-bname
            goto-position "P"
        !emacro

```

## 8. Does this fit in with other MicroEmacs commands and macros ? 


  Finally we should consider how to make the macro more like a built in
  command so that other users and macros can take advantage of this new
  feature. Firstly let us consider supporting the numerical argument which
  is passed to all commands and macros. Considering __write-buffer__ the command
  permits an invocation from the command line of:

      esc 0 C-x C-w


  or from a macro:

      0 write-buffer


  The `0` argument disables validity checks and therefore forces the write. It
  would be reasonable to expect that a new command that writes a region to a
  file behaves in exactly the same way, where the commands have consistent
  behavior it makes it far easier for the user to guess how like commands
  operate. Unfortunately this behavior is absent from our current macro
  command. To support the numerical argument then the [@?](MacroArguments(4)) and [@#](MacroArguments(4)) variables
  are used to test for and retrieve the numerical argument.

```{.emf}
        define-macro write-region
            copy-region
            set-variable #l0 $buffer-fname
            set-position "P"
            !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            yank
            set-variable $buffer-fname #l0
            !if @?
                !force !force @# write-buffer @mna
            !else
                !force !force write-buffer @mna
            !endif
            !if &not $status
                !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
                goto-position "P"
                !abort
            !endif
            delete-buffer $buffer-bname
            goto-position "P"
        !emacro

```

  __Note:__
 
 >   that the __!else__ and __!endif__ directive lines do not effect the setting of
     __$status__ so this is safe, only the execution of commands effect this
     variable.

  We can optimize the macro a little by noting that the default behavior of
  "__write-buffer__" is the same as "__1 write-buffer__" (this is not always the
  case), re-writing:

```{.emf}
        define-macro write-region
            copy-region
            set-variable #l0 $buffer-fname
            set-position "P"
            !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            yank
            set-variable $buffer-fname #l0
            !force !force @# write-buffer @mna
            !if &not $status
                !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
                goto-position "P"
                !abort
            !endif
            delete-buffer $buffer-bname
            goto-position "P"
        !emacro

```

  After all of this work there are still some compatibility problems to be
  resolved for our macro to be a true command replacement. Considering our
  use of __write-buffer__, we have effectively have:

```{.emf}
        write-buffer "myfile"

```

  The command gets the filename from the macro line and allow us to invoke
  the command in our own macros. So what about our new __write-region__ macro ?
  It is not unreasonable to expect that some macro developer in the future
  will want to write the current region out to a file and if we write this
  one correctly they will be able to use this command directly. At the
  moment a command invocation of

```{.emf}
        write-region "myfile"

```

  in another macro will not have the desired effect. The "`myfile`" argument
  is ignored and the user is always prompted for the file name. This can be
  solved by providing an optional parameter to be passed to the command
  using the /Hl @1 @1 4 variable as follows:

```{.emf}
        define-macro write-region
            copy-region
            set-variable #l0 $buffer-fname
            set-position "P"
            !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            yank
            set-variable $buffer-fname #l0
            !force set-variable #l1 @1
            !if $status
                !force !force @# write-buffer #l1 @mna
            !else
                !force !force @# write-buffer @mna
            !endif
            !if &not $status
                !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
                goto-position "P"
                !abort
            !endif
            delete-buffer $buffer-bname
            goto-position "P"
        !emacro

```

  Setting the register variable `#l1` to the first argument passed to the
  command will fail if no argument was given, so we use a __!force__ to stop the
  macro from quitting and change the __$status__ of the __set-variable__ command. If
  the assignment fails then we get the filename from the user as before, if
  it succeeds then the calling macro has provided the file name.

  The __write-region__ macro is now complete and provides both a command line
  and macro interface. It is important to note that there is a subtle
  difference between macros and built in commands even though their
  capabilities are the same. To execute __write-buffer__ in a macro and get the
  user to supply a file name you must do:

```{.emf}
        write-buffer @mna

```

  However for a macro, it is not itself a command and you cannot ask a macro
  to behave like a command. For a macro you must call it as:

```{.emf}
        write-region

```

  The use of '`@mna`' is only valid for commands, this perhaps is a quirk of
  the language which should really be fixed in the future.


## Concluding 


  We started this tutorial with a unusable 5 line macro and now have a 20
  line version which should be indistinguishable from a built in MicroEmacs
  command. The same command is available as part of the macro release and
  this document was written as part of the process of writing that macro.
  The only change to be made in making it part of the macro release is to
  change the __set-position__ label from "`P`", which a user could use, to
  something like "`\x88`" which is much safer to use.

  The final macro release version becomes:

```{.emf}
        define-macro write-region
            copy-region
            set-variable #l0 $buffer-fname
            set-position "\x88"
            !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            yank
            set-variable $buffer-fname #l0
            !force set-variable #l1 @1
            !if $status
                !force !force @# write-buffer #l1 @mna
            !else
                !force !force @# write-buffer @mna
            !endif
            !if &not $status
                !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
                goto-position "\x88"
                !abort
            !endif
            delete-buffer $buffer-bname
            goto-position "\x88"
        !emacro

```

  It is perhaps surprising the number of steps it has taken to write
  something that appears to be simple, however in writing macros there are
  many re-occurring themes and once familiar with the concepts then then you
  will typically get them right first time. Creating a macro like this takes
  approximately half an hour.

  We have to question whether it is worth writing these extensions. If you
  find yourself doing the same thing all the time then definitely yes, it
  will save time and you will have less aches and pains in your hand.
  Spending the extra time to write a good macro saves time in the long run,
  it also provides a better base on which more sophisticated macros may be
  based. MicroEmacs has actually evolved like this. Hopefully this tutorial
  will encourage rather than frighten off budding macro writers.

## MACRO DEBUGGING


  In writing new macros then you need to debug them, there are various
  strategies as follows:-


## Tracing 


  The simplest method is to add debugging information that is printed on the
  message line that traces the execution sequence as it progresses through
  the macro.

  Use [ml-write(2)](ml-write(2)) to print out values as you go, use

```{.emf}
        1000 ml-write &spr "Got here, value [%s]" #l1

```

  to see the values. The integer argument is a delay in milliseconds, the
  command above will print the message and then wait 1 second before
  continuing with execution. The wait allows you to see the message.

  Once the macro is debugged then delete or comment out the trace messages.


## Debugger 


  The macro debugger is a built in debugger that allows the macro execution
  sequence to be traced and debugged. The debugger is operation is
  controlled by the variable [$debug(5)]($debug(5)) by default the value is `0` which
  disables the debugger. The debugger displays the next command to execute
  in the message line and the user may single step through the macro and
  interrogate the variables.

  Use the __$debug__ variable for interactive debugging. The best way is to
  insert the following line somewhere BEFORE the problem occurs where the
  macro needs to be debugged:

```{.emf}
        set-variable $debug 1

```

  As soon as this variable is set then it drops the user into debug mode. If
  we applied this to our tutorial example then we would define it as:

```{.emf}
        define-macro write-region
            set-variable $debug 1       ; Enable debugger
            copy-region
            set-variable #l0 $buffer-fname
            set-position "\x88"
            !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
            yank
            set-variable $buffer-fname #l0
            !force set-variable #l1 @1
            !if $status
                !force !force @# write-buffer #l1 @mna
            !else
                !force !force @# write-buffer @mna
            !endif
            !if &not $status
                !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
                goto-position "\x88"
                !abort
            !endif
            delete-buffer $buffer-bname
            goto-position "\x88"
        !emacro

```

  so as soon as we execute __write-region__ then we drop into debug mode. The
  mode line appears as follows:-

      macro-name:position:number [line] ?


  where __macro-name__ is the name of the macro that is executing, __position__ is
  the line from the start of the macro definition. __line__ is the macro line
  that is being executed. i.e.

      display-matching-fenc:22:0 [4 show region] ?


  At the prompt the commands that are available are:-

  `?`
  
  >  Help, display the debugger commands.

  `^G`
  
  >  Abort the macro. Immediately terminates the macro sequence, the state
     of the buffers is undefined and leaves the windows in the state when
     the macro was aborted.

  `^L`
  
  >  Redraws the current screen.

  `c`
  
  >  Continues macro execution the value of $debug is set to 0. Execution
     continues without user interaction up until the next __$debug__ change.

  `s`
  
  >  Single steps through the macro, if another macro is invoked then
     debugging with continue in the new sub-macro.

  `v`
  
  >  Display the value of a variable. The user is prompted for a variable
     value to show, once entered, the value of the variable is displayed.

  _<any>_
 
  >  Any other key will step onto the next instruction, unlike _step_ then
     any macros that are invoked are not debugged.

  See the [$debug(5)]($debug(5)) help page for more information.

  It is important that you SAVE ALL YOUR WORK before starting to debug
  macros. It is possible to sometimes crash the editor up while developing
  macros, prior to the January 2005 build then the following example of
  infinite recursion would destroy the editor:

```{.emf}
        define-macro Test
            Test
        !emacro

```

  This macro nesting is now caught the nesting is limited to 20 calling
  macros.

  For everyday macros that the typical user will write MicroEmacs will be
  robust and is not likely to result in any damage. If you start writing
  macros with for deeply nested macro hooks from the core of MicroEmacs
  (i.e. ipipe callbacks) then deleting buffers under the editor will cause
  stability problems when mistakes are made. For performance reasons it is
  not possible to check for all permutations of every command that could be
  issued that may possibly change the state of the editor and then recover.
  Provided that the calls are used within their calling remit then no ill
  effects will be observed.

## MACRO LANGUAGE OVERVIEW


  MicroEmacs macro language is a run-time interpreted language and uses a
  prefix notation form, that is operators appear before their arguments,
  sometimes known as Polish notation, i.e. '`+ 3 4`' rather than the more
  conventional infix notation '`3 + 4`').

  Every line is self contained, you cannot make a single command span
  multiple line (by using something like a '\' character as in C or tcl).

  Comments start with semi-colon '`;`', anything to the right of an unquoted
  semi-colon is ignored.

```{.emf}
        ; I'm a comment and exist to the end of line.
        set-variable #l1 1     ; I am a comment to the end of line.

```

  There are three types of line

  - Blank or comment line
  - Process flow control lines using directives (i.e. '`!if #l1`')
  - Executable command lines (i.e. `forward-line`)

  The first letter of any word or token on a line is very important and
  informs MicroEmacs and the user what type of token it is. The basic token
  start characters are:

     `;` Comment
     `$` System or environment variable
     `%` User variable
     `:` Buffer variable
     `.` Command variable
     `#` Register variable
     `@` Macro variable
     `!` Directive
     `&` Function
     `"` A string, which finishes at the next unquoted `"`.
     `0-9` A number, which is read as a string
     `*` A goto label

  If its not one of the above then it must be the first letter of a
  command name.


## Escape Character 


  __Backslash__ '`\`' __is escape character in macro scripts, so every normal__
  __occurrence needs to be doubled.__

  The MicroEmacs macro language uses a backslash '`\`' character as an escape
  character. In order to use a backslash character in macro arguments then
  all backslash characters should be themselves escaped with another
  backslash i.e. '`\`' becomes '`\\`' or '`\\`' becomes '`\\\\`'. If the escaping is
  omitted then it is likely that the command will receive an incorrect
  character sequence that will be misinterpreted and cause the command to
  fail or perform an incorrect action.


## Comments 


  Comments may appear anywhere on a line and everything to the right of the
  semi-colon to the end of the line is ignored:

```{.emf}
        ; this is a comment
        set-variable #l0 1    ; this part of the line is a comment.

```

## System or environment variables 


  MicroEmacs system variables start with '`$`' and are used to configure most
  aspects of the editor (such as tab widths, window drawing characters
  etc.). There are a fixed list of system variables, see [MicroEmacs - Macro Language Glossary](Macro Glossary).

  If a given variable name is not a recognized system variable (e.g. `$PATH`)
  then MicroEmacs treats it as an environment variable, using
  [set-variable(2)](set-variable(2)) to change an environment variable. This is useful when
  used in conjunction with one of MicroEmacs's shell commands. If the
  environment variable does not exist its value is returned as the string
  "`ERROR`".


## User variables 


  User variables commence with a percentage character '`%`' and have a global
  context within the editor, but unlike the _system_ _variables_ they do not
  span into the environment space (i.e. private to MicroEmacs).

  The use of __User Variables__ is discouraged because of their scope,
  historically MicroEmacs only supported system and user variables. If two
  different macros use the same variable then things go wrong which is
  principally why they are no longer used. Macros have become a very large
  part of JASSPA's MicroEmacs and therefore they must be reliable by the
  nature of their global scope they are considered unreliable.

  A few commands still use them but this is more for historical reasons, for
  example xgrep's [%xgrep-com(5)](%xgrep-com(5)) variable to set the default grep command
  would be better implemented as the command variable `.xgrep.com`, see below.


## Buffer Variables 


  Buffer variables are set in the context of a buffer, each buffer has its
  own independent list of buffer variables so this type of variable is used
  by macros which need to store buffer context information. As an example, a
  file hook may allow each buffer to have its own private [$fill-ignore(5)]($fill-ignore(5))
  value (the variable is global). It may stores each buffer's own fill
  ignore in the variable `:fill-ignore`. This is private to the buffer.
  Referencing the variable `:fill-ignore` retrieves the current buffer's
  `:fill-ignore` variable, if it not set its value is returned as "`ERROR`".
  Referencing `:*scratch*:fill-ignore` retrieves the "`*scratch*`" buffer's
  `:fill-ignore` value.

  The operator [&exist(4)](&exist(4)) may be used to determine if the buffer variable has
  been created and set.


## Command Variables 


  Command variables are set in the context of a command or macro and are
  similar to buffer variables. `.var` retrieves the the current macros command
  variable whereas `.hilight.var` will get command __hilight__ command variable.

  It is important to understand that these variables are stored with the
  command and the command must exist before the variable is used. As an
  example of the command variable scope, consider the following macro
  definitions.

```{.emf}
        define-macro Test1
            ml-write &spr "Test1 .foo is [%s]" .foo
        !emacro
        set-variable .Test1.foo "hello world"
        define-macro Test2
            ml-write &spr "Test1 .foo is [%s]" .Test1.foo
        !emacro

```

  On running __Test1__ and __Test2__ both will print "`Test1` `.foo` `is` `[hello` `world]`".
  The initialisation of `.Test1.foo` is performed outside of the macro and is
  done only once, once the variable has been initialized the line is
  discarded. This discard reduces the run-time memory overhead.


## Register Variables 


  Most variables are used to store temporary information, once a macro
  completes the variable is no longer required. [Register variables](MicroEmacs - Macro Language Glossary) are used
  for this purpose, their scope is only the current macro's execution as
  such they are the most efficient variables to use.

  A new set of registers is created every time that a macro is executed,
  called `#l0` through to `#l9`. Where macros are nested then the parent
  registers are effectively stacked and may be access through `#p0` through to
  `#p9`, this is especially useful when writing recursive macros or macros
  which must return values as they may return a processed result in the
  parents register. A single set of registers always exists which is the
  global registers `#g0` through to `#g9`, for a first level macro then this
  forms its parent register variable.


## Macro variables 


  [Macro variables](MicroEmacs - Macro Language Glossary) commence with a at-sign @ and are only available in the
  context of a macro and are used to retrieve the numeric argument,
  parameters etc. The variables include:-

  >  __@?__ - Boolean determines if a numeric argument was supplied  
     __@#__ - The value of the numeric argument  
 
  >  __@0__ - The name of the macro  
     __@1__ - The first argument of macro  
     __@2__ - The second argument of macro  
     __@3__ ... __@___n_  

  >  __@p__ - The name of the calling (or parent) macro.


## Directives 


  The [Macro Directives](MicroEmacs - Macro Language Glossary) are denoted by a __!__ prefix and provide control over
  the command sequence. Directives are used to define macros and affect the
  macro execution sequence. i.e.

```{.emf}
        define-macro if-test
            set-variable #l0 1
            !if #l0
                ml-write "you will see this"
                !return
            !elif &not #l0
                ml-write "you will not see this"
                !abort
            !else
                ml-write "you will not see this"
                !abort
            !endif
        !emacro

```
 
  The common directives are:-

  __!abort__
 
  > [!abort](!return(4)) terminates a macro and exits with a false status.

  __!return__

  > [!return](!return(4)) terminates a macro and exits with a true status.

  __!while__/__!continue__/__!done__
 
  > [!while](!while(4)) defines a conditional loop that is tested before entry to the
     loop, the [!continue](!while(4)) statement within the loop allows the loop to be
     broken. __!while__ loops may not be nested, but may be contained within a
    [!repeat/!until](!repeat(4)) construct.

  __!repeat/!until__

  > [!repeat](!repeat(4)) defines a conditional loop that is tested on exit from the
     loop. __!repeat__ loops may not be nested, but may be contained within a
    [!while/!done](!while(4)) construct.

  __define-macro/!emacro__
 
  > [define-macro](define-macro(2)) defines a new macro which is terminated with a [!emacro](!emacro(4)).

  __!if/!elif/!else/!endif__

  > [!if](!if(4)) defines a conditional statement, where there is more than one
    condition then the [!elif](!if(4)) directive may continue the conditional test.

  __!goto/!tgoto__
 
  > [!goto](!goto(4)) and [!tgoto](!goto(4)) provide an absolute unconditional and conditional
    jump to a __*label__ in a file, respectively. A __!goto__ label is defined as
    line commencing with a `*` followed by a name i.e. __*label__.

  __!force__ _command_
 
  > [!force](!force(4)) ignores the return status of a command while executing a macro,
     thereby ignoring any exceptions which would otherwise halt macro
     execution.


## Functions 


  All [functions](Introduction to Variable Functions) are denoted by a __&__ prefix, they are perhaps miss named and
  should be called operators as they operate on variables and literal
  strings to produce a new result.

  There are different type of functions:

  - Numeric - interprets arguments as numbers i.e. add two numbers
    [&add(4)](&add(4)).
  - String - interprets arguments as strings i.e. to concatenate two
        strings together [&cat(4)](&cat(4)).
  - Logical - boolean operators i.e. greater than [&great(4)](&great(4)).
  - Key - key bindings i.e. key binding of command [&kbind(4)](&cbind(4)).
  - Bitwise - bit-wise numerical operators i.e. bitwise AND [&band(4)](&band(4)).
  - File - file interaction i.e. find a file [&find(4)](&find(4)).
  - Lists - string item lists i.e. find item in list [&lfind(4)](&lfind(4)).
  - Miscellaneous - miscellaneous functions to which query and return
        information to the caller i.e. registry query [&reg(4)](&reg(4)).

  The functions use a postfix notation as the _function_ appears before the
  arguments.

```{.emf}
        set-variable #l0 2
        set-variable #l1 1
        !if &gre #l0 #l1
            ml-write "#l0 is greater than #l1"
        !endif

        ml-write &cat "#l0 + #l1 = " &add #l0 #l1

```

  The interpretation of strings and numbers is discussed in the next
  section.


## Strings and Numbers 


  All variables are treated as strings within MicroEmacs so the integer
  value of 102 is the string `"102"`. Where functions require an integer
  argument (i.e. [&add](&abs(4))) the strings are converted to integers, operated on
  and converted back to a string result. Floating point notation is not
  understood.

  Integers may be expressed in different bases:

     `0xXXX` - Hexadecimal notation i.e. _0x12af_.
     `0oooo` - Octal notation requires a leading _012673_.
     `ddddd` - Decimal notation _12345_.

  Strings do not necessarily need to be quoted, provided that the string is
  unambiguous and does not include any special characters then all input
  between white spaces is considered to be a string. Strings may be quoted
  '`"string"`', within a quoted string then a backslash '`\`'is used as an
  escape character. the escape sequences that are interpreted include:

## NAME


  gdiff - Command line graphical file difference
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __me__ "@gdiff" "_version1_" "_version2_"


## DESCRIPTION


  MicroEmacs may be executed from the command line to invoke the Graphical
  Difference [gdiff(3)](gdiff(3)) macro, showing the difference(s) between two files.

  The editor is invoked in __gdiff__ mode and shows the difference between the
  two files on the command line. The two files are presented side by side
  and the lines are matched together, the windows are effectively locked
  together, scrolling one window causes the other window to scroll.

  The changes are shown as color coded regions of highlighted text. Each
  block (or line) has to be accepted or rejected by the user, when all
  blocks have been accepted then the buffer may be written out merging the
  changes from both files depending on the accept/reject status. Blocks
  which have been accepted are typically shown in green, the rejected lines
  are shown in red.


## Key Mapping 


  The keyboard mapping in __gdiff__ mode is defined as follows:

  __esc-h__
 
  >  Help information.

  __C-up__/__p__
 
  >  Advance to the previous difference.

  __C-down__/__n__
 
  >  Advance to the next difference.

  __esc-up__/P
 
  >  Advance to the previous unassigned difference.

  __esc-down__/N
 
  >  Advance to the next unassigned difference.

  __g__
 
  >  Globally select all of the differences from the current window as
     assigned.

  __G__
 
  >  Globally un-select all of the assigned differences.

  __r__/__space__/__return__/__left-mouse__
 
  >  Selects the current difference, only operates within a highlighted
     difference region.

  __R__
 
  >  Un-selects the current difference, only operates within a highlighted
     difference region.

  __l__
 
  >  Selects the current line in a highlighted region for assignment.

  __L__
 
  >  Unselects the current line in a highlighted region for assignment.

  __save-buffer__
 
  >  Saves the current buffer, all of the assignment changes are merged and
     written out to the existing buffer.

  __write-buffer__
 
  >  Saves the current buffer after merging all of the and assignment
     changes and prompts the user for the name of a new buffer.

  __left__/__right__
 
  >  Scrolls the buffer left or right.

  __kill-buffer__/__C-x C-c__
 
  >  Quits __gdiff__, the user is prompted to save changes.


## NOTES


  The macro is defined in file `gdiff.emf`.

## NAME


  2unix - Convert text files to UNIX format files
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __me__ "@2dos" _<files>_  
  __me__ "@2mac" _<files>_  
  __me__ "@2unix" _<files>_  
  __me__ "@2win" _<files>_


## DESCRIPTION


  The start-up file `2unix.emf` may be invoked from the command line as a
  filter to convert all text files, which may be in MS-DOS, Windows,
  Macintosh format into UNIX text format.

  Each file specified on the command line is interrogated and the line
  ending modified to UNIX.

  `2dos`, `2win` and `2mac` similarly operate to provide conversion from any of
  these formats to MS-DOS, Macintosh or Windows file formats.


## EXAMPLE


  When using ME as a command line filter it is advisable to control the
  backup command line options. Typically the backups and auto-save are
  disabled so that no backup files are generated i.e.

      me -a -B "@2dos" files...


  Performs a conversion from UNIX to MS-DOS and disables the generation of
  auto-save files and backups.

  NE may be used to run the filters, by default NE runs without backup and
  auto-save mode enabled and the flags should NOT be used.

      ne "@2dos" files...


## NOTES


  `MS-DOS` files are defined to use a line ending of `\r\n`, the file is
  terminated with `ctrl-z`.

  Macintosh files are defined to use a line ending of `\r`, there is no
  special end of file character.

  Microsoft Windows files are defined to use a line ending of `\r\n`, there is
  no special end of file character.

  UNIX files are defined to use a line ending of `\n`, there is no special end
  of file character.

  The unix2dos.emf, dos2unix.emf and unix2win.emf were renamed to 2dos.emf,
  2unix.emf and 2win.emf when 2mac.emf was added in October 2006 as the
  'from' format is not important and number of combinations became
  unmanageable.

## NAME


  benchmrk - Benchmark MicroEmacs macro processor speed
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __me__ "@benchmrk"


## DESCRIPTION


  The start-up file `benchmrk.emf` may be invoked from the command line to
  time the macro processor variable manipulation times.

  This macro suite was developed to optimize the macro processor
  performance, and allows comparable analysis of various macro variable
  manipulations. The macro is not important in it's own right and is not
  likely to be useful. Running it will provide an in-site into the speed of
  the macro language and should indicate to the user what are good and bad
  things to be doing.

  As an aside, as MicroEmacs interprets the macro code the it is important
  that the processing operates at a reasonable speed. Most extensions
  offering additional functionality are likely to be added to MicroEmacs by
  way of a macro implementation - this allows speedy development of new
  features. Obviously core changes do occur when we find that we cannot
  support certain new requirements, or when the macro code becomes too
  convoluted. In these cases, new commands are added to help us solve the
  problem. However, recent evolution of the code has indicated that the core
  set is now reasonably complete.

  ctags - Generate a C tags file
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __me__ "@ctags" [_-v%tag-option=<flags>_] [_files_]


## DESCRIPTION


  The start-up file `ctags.emf` may be invoked from the command line to
  generate a __tags__ file for C and C++ source and header files.

  Given a list of _files_ a tags file `tags` is generated in the current
  directory, which may be used by the [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2)) command. This is a good
  alternative on Microsoft platforms where a utility such as __ctags(1)__ is not
  typically available. If no _files_ are specified the default file list is
  "`./`", i.e. process the current directory. If a directory name is given
  (such as the default "`./`") all C and C++ source and header files within
  the directory will be processed.

  The value of variable __%tag-option__ is used to control the tag generation
  process, its value _<flags>_ can contain any number of the following flags:

  `a`
 
  >  Append new tags to the existing tag file, note that if also using flag
     '`m`' multiple 'tags' to the same item may be created.

  `m`
 
  >  Enable multiple tags. This enables the existence of 2 tags with the
     same tag name, but typically with different locations. See help on
     [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2)) for more information on multiple tag support.

  `r`
 
  >  Enables recursive mode, any sub-directory found within any given
     directories will also be processed.

  `v`
 
  >  Add global variables to the tag file. (i.e. variables marked with
     _extern_).

  `e`
 
  >  Add enumerated variables to the tag file (i.e. _enum_ members).

  `s`
 
  >  Add structure, type definitions and classes to the tag file (i.e.
     _stuct_, _typedef_ and _class_).

  The generated tags file includes `#define` and C++ class names.


## NOTES


  This function is invoked from menu

  >  __Tools -> C Tools -> Create Tags File__

  when the user requests a tags file to be generated.

  The user setup file "`myctags.emf`" is executed by ctags during start-up,
  this file can be used to over-ride any of the ctags configuration
  variables (see below).

  The following variables are set within "`ctags.emf`" and are used to control
  the process:-

  __%tag-option__
 
  >  Tags options flag, default value is "". See above for more
     information.

  __%tag-filemask__
  
  >  A list of source file masks to be processed when a directory is given,
     default value is "`:*.[cC]:*.cpp:*.cc:*.h:*.hpp:`".

  __%tag-ignoredir__
  
  >  A list of directories to be ignored when recursive option is used,
     default value is "`:SCCS/:CVS/:.git/:.svn/:`".

  These variables can be changed using the -v command-line option or via the

$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __me__ "@ntags" _<files>_


## DESCRIPTION


  The start-up file `ntags.emf` may be invoked from the command line to
  generate a __tags__ file for nroff files.

  Given a list of _files_ a tags file `tags` is generated in the current
  directory, which may be used by the [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2)) command. If no _files_ are
  specified the default file list is "`./`", i.e. process the current
  directory. If a directory name is given (such as the default "`./`") all
  nroff files within the directory will be processed.

  The value of variable __%tag-option__ is used to control the tag generation
  process, its value _<flags>_ can contain any number of the following flags:

  `a`
 
  >  Append new tags to the existing tag file, note that if also using flag

     directories will also be processed.


## NOTES


  This function is invoked from menu

  >  __Tools -> Nroff Tools -> Create Tags File__

  when the user requests a tags file to be generated.

  The tags are generated from the nroff macro:-

      .XI <name> ......


  which indicates an index entry, where _<name>_ is the tag name. _<name>_ may
  be delimited by double quotes if any whitespace is present in the string.

  This is the macro definition used in the MicroEmacs documentation system.
  The `ntags.emf` file should be edited and shadowed in the user directory if
  some other search criteria is used for nroff files. This macro file should
  provide a good starting point for any other search.

  The user setup file "`myntags.emf`" is executed by ntags during start-up,
  this file can be used to over-ride any of the ntags configuration
  variables (see below).

  The following variables are set within "`ntags.emf`" and are used to control
  the process:-

  __%tag-option__
 
  >  Tags options flag, default value is "". See above for more
     information.

  __%tag-filemask__
  
  >  A list of source file masks to be processed when a directory is given,
     default value is "`:*.nrs:*.[1-9]:*.n:`".

  __%tag-ignoredir__

## DESCRIPTION


  The start-up file `printalls.emf` may be invoked from the command line to
  generate a print job for each file specified on the command line.

  Given a list of _<files>_, the files are loaded into the editor, and then
  printed through MicroEmacs printing formatter. This is an alternative to
  __cgrind(1)__ or some other syntax smart _pretty print_ filter.

  The operation of this macro assumes that the printer is functioning
  correctly.


## BUGS


  As a guess, I would probably bet that this does not work very well on
  Windows as a dialog is invoked for the print.

## NAME


  perltags - Generate a Perl tags file
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __me__ "@perltags" [_-v%tag-option=<flags>_] [_files_]


## DESCRIPTION


  The start-up file `perltags.emf` may be invoked from the command line to
  generate a __tags__ file for Perl files, see [pl(9)](pl(9)).

  Given a list of _files_ a tags file `tags` is generated in the current
  directory, which may be used by the [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2)) command. If no _files_ are
  specified the default file list is "`./`", i.e. process the current
  directory. If a directory name is given (such as the default "`./`") all
  Perl files having the `.pl` or `.pm` file extension within the directory will 
  be processed.

  The value of variable __%tag-option__ is used to control the tag generation
  process, its value _<flags>_ can contain any number of the following flags:

  `a`
 
  >  Append new tags to the existing tag file, note that if also using flag
     '`m`' multiple 'tags' to the same item may be created.

  `m`
 
  >  Enable multiple tags. This enables the existence of 2 tags with the
     same tag name, but typically with different locations. See help on
     [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2)) for more information on multiple tag support.

  `r`
 
  >  Enables recursive mode, any sub-directory found within any given
     directories will also be processed.

! 3 compile
## NAME


  compile - Start a compilation process
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __compile__ "_compile-command_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __compile__ gets and executes the compile command using a pipe execution
  (incremental pipe on UNIX platforms), loading the output into a buffer
  called "__*compile*__", with go to error parsing using the command
  [get-next-line(2)](get-next-line(2)). The default compile execution is set by variable
  [%compile-com(5)](%compile-com(5)), the error parsing is setup using the command
  [add-next-line(2)](add-next-line(2)).

  Before the compile command is executed [save-some-buffers(2)](save-some-buffers(2)) is executed to
  allow the user to ensure that all relevant buffers are saved. If an
  argument is given to compile then it is passed on to this command, so if
  an argument of 0 is given, all buffers are automatically saved.

  By default the output lines in the window wrap, wrapping may be disabled
  during compilations by redefining the wrap mode as follows. Create the
  file `myipipe.emf` to redefine the behavior and add the following lines:-

```{.emf}
        ; Macro to redefine the wrapping behavior of the *compile* buffer
        0 define-macro my-fhook-ipipe
            !if &seq $buffer-bname "*compile*"
                -1 buffer-mode "wrap"
            !endif
        !emacro

## NAME

  rgrep - Execute recursive grep command
$a


## SYNOPSIS


|xgrep
  __xgrep__ "_expression files..._"
|rgrep
  __rgrep__ "_expression_" "_base-path_" "_file-mask_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __xgrep__ executes the __grep(1)__ command with the command line set by the
  [%xgrep-com(5)](%xgrep-com(5)) variable and the user supplied expression and file list
  _files..._. The output of the command is piped into the __*grep*__ buffer ready
  for the [get-next-line(2)](get-next-line(2)) command to step through all matched lines. The
  syntax from the grep output must be setup using [add-next-line(2)](add-next-line(2)).

  If an argument is given then a [pipe-shell-command(2)](pipe-shell-command(2)) is used instead of
  [ipipe-shell-command(2)](ipipe-shell-command(2)), this is useful when used in macros as it ensures
  that __grep__ has finished before the command returns.

  __rgrep__ is similar to __grep__ in that it uses __grep(1)__ to search for all
  occurrences of _expression_, but __rgrep__ also uses __find(1)__ to search for
  _expression_ in all files matching the _file-mask_ in all directories from
  _base-path_ down.


## NOTES


  __xgrep__ is a macro defined in `xfind.emf`.

  __grep(1)__ must be executable on the system before grep or rgrep can
  function, __find(1)__ must also be available for rgrep to work. The __find(1)__
  command is defined by variable [%xfind-com(5)](%xfind-com(5)), the default when not defined
  is `find`.


## EXAMPLE


  The __xgrep__ command is generally set up in the startup files as follows:-

```{.emf}
        ;
        ; setup the next-error stuff including grep and compiling
        ;
        set-variable $line-template "[0-9]+"
        set-variable $file-template "[a-zA-Z:]*[0-9a-zA-Z\_.]+"
        ;
        ; Definitions for GNU grep utility.
        ;
        set-variable %xgrep-com "grep -n "
        0 add-next-line "*grep*"
        add-next-line "*grep*" "%f:%l:"

$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __save-all__


## DESCRIPTION


  __save-all__ cycles through all buffers, dictionaries, registry files and
  current session writing back any changes made. For each buffer,
  dictionary, session or registry file which has been modified the user is
  prompted before the changes are saved, a value of __y__ initiates the save, __n__
  skips the save.

  The argument _n_ can be used to change the default behavior of save-all
  described above, _n_ is a bit based flag where:-

  __0x01__
  
  >  Enables the user prompt before the file is saved (default). If this
     flag is not supplied then all modified files will automatically be
     written.


## NOTES


  __save-all__ is a macro defined in `me.emf`, using commands
  [save-some-buffers(2)](save-some-buffers(2)), [save-dictionary(2)](save-dictionary(2)), [save-session(3)](save-session(3)), and

## NAME


  paragraph-to-line - Convert a paragraph to a single line
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __paragraph-to-line__


## DESCRIPTION


  __paragraph-to-line__ is a variation of [fill-paragraph(2)](fill-paragraph(2)). __paragraph-to-line__
  reduces each of the next _n_ paragraphs of text to single lines. This
  command is typically used to prepare text for import into a word processor
  such as __Microsoft Word__ or __Word Perfect__. Reduction of text to a single line
  allows the word processor to import the raw text file and keep the text
  within paragraph blocks. If the text is not prepared then all of the
  line-feeds have to be manually deleted.

  __paragraph-to-line__ allows text based documents to be prepared in MicroEmacs
  2009 and imported into the word processor at the final stage for
  formatting and layout.

## DESCRIPTION


  __sort-lines-ignore-case__ forces the current buffers [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) mode to off
  and then calls [sort-lines(2)](sort-lines(2)) which will perform a case insensitive
  alphabetical line sort from the mark position to the current cursor
  position. The state of the current buffers __exact__ mode is restored on
  completion.

! 3 clean
## NAME


  clean - Remove redundant white spaces from the current buffer
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __clean__


## DESCRIPTION


  __clean__ removes redundant white spaces from the current buffer, there are
  three types this command remove:

  1)
     Any space or tab character at the end of the line. All are removed
     until the last character is not a space or a tab, or the line is
     empty. Note that an empty line is not removed unless at the end of the
     buffer.

  2)
     Space characters are removed when the next character is a tab, making
     the space redundant, e.g. the strings "` Hello World`" and " Hello
     World" will look identical because the tab character ('_ _') indents the
     text to the 8th column with or without the space so the space can be
     removed.

  3)
     Superfluous empty lines at the end of the buffer are removed, leaving
     only one empty line.

  4)
     If argument _n_ is given (value is not used) multiple blank lines are
     reduced to a single blank line.


## DIAGNOSTICS


  `[Command illegal in view mode]`
  
  >  Caused by a redundant white space being found and the buffer being in
     view mode. Note that if clean completes while the buffer is in view
     mode then no superfluous white spaces where found.


## NOTES


  __clean__ is a macro defined in `format.emf`.

  Most of this command's operation is performed by simple regex search and
  replace strings:

  a)
     Search for: "[\t ]+$" Replace with: "\\0"

  b)
     Search for: "[ ]+\t" Replace with: "\t"

  c)
     Search for: "\n\n\n" Replace with: "\n\n"

  It is useful to define a new command called __spotless__ in the user macro
  file which cleans the file and removes blank lines. The new command is
  defined as follows:-

```{.emf}
        ; spotless; Perform a clean and remove any multi-blank lines.
        define-macro spotless
            -1 clean
        !emacro

```

! 3 replace-all-string
## NAME


  replace-all-string - Replace string with new string in a list of files
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __replace-all-string__ "_from_" "_to_" "_files_" ["_grep-from_"]


## DESCRIPTION


  __replace-all-string__, similar to [replace-string(2)](replace-string(2)), replaces all occurrences
  of "_from_" to "_to_" in the given list of files without prompting the user.

  The command finds all occurrences of "_from_" by calling the command [grep(3)](grep(3))
  to search for string "_from_" in files "_files_". Thus all relevant edited
  files must be saved or __grep__ may return the wrong line numbers. This is
  achieved by a call to [save-some-buffers(2)](save-some-buffers(2)) which prompts the user to save
  any changed buffers one at a time.

  Each occurrence of "_from_" is jumped to using [get-next-line(2)](get-next-line(2)) and the
  string is replaced by the call:

```{.emf}
        -1 replace-string "from" "to"

```

  This replaces all occurrences of "_from_" to "_to_" on the current line only,
  hence the line numbers must be correct. This also means that the "_from_"
  search string must be correctly formatted for both grep and
  replace-string, unless bit 0x02 is set (see below).

  The given argument _n_ is a bit based flag which changes the default
  behavior described above. The bits have the following effect:-

  __0x01__
  
  >  Prompt before saving any changed buffer, enabled by default. If this
     bit is not set then any changed buffer is automatically saved before
     the __grep__ is performed.

  __0x02__
  
  >  If set then a fourth argument "_grep-from_" must also be given. This
     string is used in place of the "_from_" string for the __grep__ only.


## NOTES


  __replace-all-string__ is a macro defined in `search.emf`.

  The __grep__ command must be working before this command can function
  properly.

  It is not recommended to use a "from" or "to" string which uses more that
  one line as the results may be unpredictable.

  As the change is likely to be over several files a single call to [undo(2)](undo(2))
  at the end of execution will not undo all the changes made. To undo all
  the changes made, use [get-next-line(2)](get-next-line(2)) to loop through all the occurrences
  and call __undo__ for each occurrence

## DESCRIPTION


  __query-replace-all-string__, similar to [query-replace-string(2)](query-replace-string(2)), replaces all
  occurrences of "_from_" to "_to_" in the given list of files prompting the
  user before replacing each occurrence.

  The command finds all occurrences of "_from_" by calling the command [grep(3)](grep(3))
  to search for string "_from_" in files "_files_". Thus all relevant edited
  files must be saved or __grep__ may return the wrong line numbers. This is
  achieved by a call to [save-some-buffers(2)](save-some-buffers(2)) which prompts the user to save
  any changed buffers one at a time.

  string is replaced by the call:

```{.emf}
        -1 query-replace-string "from" "to"

```

  This query-replaces all occurrences of "_from_" to "_to_" on the current line
  only, hence the line numbers must be correct. This also means that the
  "_from_" search string must be correctly formatted for both grep and
  query-replace-string, unless bit 0x02 is set (see below).

  The given argument _n_ is a bit based flag which changes the default
  behavior described above. The bits have the following effect:-

  __0x01__

## NAME


  tabs-to-spaces - Converts all tabs to spaces
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __tabs-to-spaces__


## DESCRIPTION


  __tabs-to-spaces__ converts all tab characters found in the current buffer
  with spaces. The number of spaces a tab is replaced with depends on the
  column of the tab character and the setting of [$buffer-tab-width(5)]($buffer-tab-width(5)).

  The cursor is restored to the start of the current line after completion.

! 3 calc
## NAME


  calc - Integer calculator
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __calc__ "_string_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __calc__ can perform simple integer based calculations given by "_string_",
  where the "_string_" takes the following form:-

      "[b]<s>"


  Where '_b_' is an optional letter setting the required output base which can
  be one of the following:

      `b   ` - Binary
      `o   ` - Octal
      `d   ` - Decimal
      `x   ` - Hexadecimal

  Default when omitted is '_d_' (decimal). "_s_" is the sum to be calculated,
  which should be bodmas in form. Following is a list of valid symbols.

      `(..)` - Parentheses (contents calculated first)
      `!   ` - Logical not
      `&&  ` - Logical and
      `||  ` - Logical or
      `==  ` - Logical equals
      `!=  ` - Logical not equals
      `~   ` - Bitwise not
      `&   ` - Bitwise and
      `|   ` - Bitwise or
      `^   ` - Bitwise xor
      `/   ` - Divide
      `*   ` - Multiply
      `%   ` - Modulus
      `+   ` - Addition
      `-   ` - Subtraction
      `0xNN` - Hexadecimal number
      `0NN ` - Octal number
      `LR  ` - Last calculation recall

  Any MicroEmacs variables can be used in the calculation. The result of the
  calculation is stored in [.calc.result(5)](.calc.result(5)). The argument _n_ is a bitwise flag
  where:

  __0x01__
  
  >  Print out the result on the message-line.

  __0x02__
  
  >  Use string comparisons for == and != comparisons. This has the
     advantage of being able to calc "Foo" == "Bar" etc.

  When omitted the default argument is 1.


## EXAMPLE


  To calculate the number of hours in a year:

      calc "365*24"


  To then calculate the number of seconds in the year:

      calc "LR*60*60"

! 3 time
## NAME


  time - Command time evaluator
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __time__ "_string_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __time__ evaluates the time take to execute line "_string_". __time__ uses command
  [execute-line(2)](execute-line(2)) to execute the given string.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example simply times the time take to save the current
  buffer:-

      time "save-buffer"


## NOTES


  __time__ is a macro defined in `misc.emf`.

  On multi-task systems like UNIX __time__ cannot take into account the number
  of other processes running at the same time, it can only return the actual
  time elapse. This leads to inaccuracies and variation in results.

! 3 Mahjongg
## NAME


  Mahjongg - MicroEmacs 2009 version of the solitaire Mah Jongg game
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __Mahjongg__


## DESCRIPTION


  Mah Jongg is an ancient Chinese game usually played by four players with
  tiles similar to dominos. This is a MicroEmacs 2009 version which was
  inspired by the X-Windows version of the same game. The X-Windows version
  for the solitaire game originally seen on the PC and later ported to
  SunView.


## Theory Of Play 


  The object of the game is to remove all the tiles from the board. Tiles
  are removed by matching two identical tiles which have either an open left
  edge or open right edge. The only exception to this rule is that any open
  "_flower_" tile (bamboo `[BAMB]`, orchid `[ORCH]`, plum `[PLUM]`, or chrysanthemum
  `[CHRY]`) matches any other open "_flower_" tile and any open "_season_" tile
  (spring, summer, autumn, or winter) matches any other open "_season_" tile.

  Tiles are stacked on the board, the height of the tile is indicated by the
  color coding as follows:-

      `Level 5` - White
      `Level 4` - Red
      `Level 3` - Yellow
      `Level 2` - Green
      `Level 1` - Cyan

  To remove a pair of tiles, click the left mouse button on a tile (which
  will show in the selection color) and then click the left mouse button on
  the matching tile. At this point, both tiles will disappear from the
  board. If after selecting the first tile, you decide that you don't wish
  to play that tile, simply reclick the left button on the selected tile,
  alternatively click the right button to deselect any selected tile.

  To the right of the board are a number of control buttons. To select an
  option, click the left mouse button on it.

  __NEW__
 
  >  Start a new game (keyboard n).

  __SAME__
  
  >  Start the same game again (keyboard s).

  __QUIT__
  
  >  Exit the game (keyboard q).

  __HELP__
  
  >  This help page (keyboard esc h).

  The counter shows the number of remaining tiles on the board, at the start
  of the game there are 144 tiles.


## NOTES


  Mahjongg is a macro defined in `mahjongg.emf`.

  Mah Jongg may only be played with a mouse, there is no keyboard support,
  with the exception of the re-start keys.

## NAME


  Match-It - MicroEmacs 2009 version of the Match-It game
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __Match-It__


## DESCRIPTION


  The object of the game is to score the largest number of points, to do
  this the player must complete as many sheets as possible. A sheet is
  completed when all the tiles are removed from the board within the given
  time limit - ALL sheet are possible. If the player fails to remove all the
  tiles before the time runs out a life is lost, if all lives have been lost
  then the game is over.

  Tiles are removed from the board by matching two identical tiles which
  have an 'extraction' path between them. The only exception to this rule is
  that any open "_flower_" tile (bamboo `[BAMB]`, orchid `[ORCH]`, plum `[PLUM]`, or
  chrysanthemum `[CHRY]`) matches any other open "_flower_" tile and any open
  "_season_" tile (spring, summer, autumn, or winter) matches any other open
  "_season_" tile.

  An 'extraction' path is a straight line which uses 2 or less right angles,
  the following are legal extraction paths, '`*`'s denote the right angles:

                        A---*       *-----*     A----*
            A----A          A       AXXXXXA     XXXXX|
                                                A----*


  The following are illegal paths:

            *----*          *---*
            AXXXX|          |XXXA
            XXXXA*      A---*XXXX


  2 points are added to the score whenever a pair is successfully removed, a
  point is deducted whenever a pair is selected which can not be removed
  because there is no valid extraction path. There are 2 aids, pressing the
  right button on a tile when no other tile is selected will hilight all
  tiles of matching type, this costs 4 points. The other help is activated
  by a button at the top right of the screen and it removes a random
  removable pair (or informs the user that there are no removable pairs),
  there are a limited number of these helps.

  At the end of a successful sheet the score is increased be the time left,
  the number of lives and helps remaining and by the Pedigree and Internal
  bonuses if they were achieved.

  The Pedigree bonus is obtained when only identical tiles are paired, i.e.
  no differing flowers or seasons were paired, 50 points are awarded when
  achieved. Its status is indicated by a 'P' to the left of the 'Help'
  button and the top of the window.

  The internal bonus is obtained when the outer 4 margins are not used. If
  the left or right margins are not used then 10 points are awarded for
  each, if the top or bottom are not used then 20 points are awarded for
  each and if none are used then 400 points are awarded! The status on the
  Internal bonus is indicated by an '`I`' surrounded by '`*`'s, one for each
  margin. This can be found next to the Pedigree bonus '`P`'.


## GAME CONTROLS


  To the right of the high score table on the main menu there are a number
  of control buttons. To select an option, click the left mouse button on
  it.

  __NEW__
  
  >  Start a new game.

  __QUIT__
  
  >  Exit Match-It.

  __HELP__
  
  >  This help page (keyboard esc h).

  During a sheet, to remove a pair of tiles, click the left mouse button on
  a tile (which will show in the selection color) and then click the left
  mouse button on the matching tile. At this point, if the tiles can be
  removed, the extraction path is drawn and both tiles will disappear from
  the board. If after selecting the first tile, you decide that you don't
  wish to play that tile, simply reclick the left button on the selected
  tile, alternatively click the right button to deselect any selected tile.

  To the top right of the sheet there are a number of control buttons:-

  __HELP__
  
  >  Removes a tile pair.

  __QUIT__
  
  >  Exit the game.

  __BOSS__
  
  >  Hides Match-It, also acts as a pause. Execute Match-It again to return
     to the game.

  The top left shows the number of remaining lives, the current sheet level,
  the current score, time remaining for the current sheet and the status of
  the Internal and Pedigree bonuses.

$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __Patience__


## DESCRIPTION


  Patience (or Solitaire) is a solitaire game using a standard set of
  playing cards. The object of the game is to use all of the cards in the
  deck to build up four suit stacks from Ace to King.

  The board is laid out with the dealer pile at the top right hand corner,
  to the left are four suit stacks onto which cards of the same suit are
  placed, in ascending order from the Ace. Below these two areas of the
  board are seven row stacks, organized in a triangular shape with zero to
  six downward facing cards.

  Cards may be moved around the playing area by stacking alternative red and
  black cards in descending order on the row stacks. When a row stack has no
  upturned cards on the stack then the top card may be turned over and may
  be played. If a stack becomes empty then only a King may be moved into the
  vacant position. Cards may be removed from the dealer, they are
  over-turned in sets of three cards, the underlying 2 cards are visible,
  but are not accessible, only the top card may be removed and played from
  the dealer.

  Cards are moved around the board using the mouse. Cards may be moved from
  the dealer or between the row stacks by placing the mouse over the card to
  be moved and pressing the left mouse button. Move the cursor to the new
  card position and release the left mouse button. If the move is legal then
  the card(s) are moved to the new stack. Multiple cards may be moved from
  the row stacks, the appropriate card(s) to be moved is automatically
  determined.

  Cards may be moved onto the suit stacks by a single left mouse press and
  release on the same card, the card is moved to the appropriate suit stack.
  The same technique is used to turn cards over in the suit stacks, and to
  deal the next set of cards by the dealer. To deal, then click on the
  down-turned card stack, if there are no further cards at the dealer then
  click on the empty position and the dealer will turn over the dealer stack
  and deal from the top again.

  Note that once a card is played onto the suit stacks then it cannot be
  removed.

  To the right of the board are a number of control buttons. To select an
  option, click the left mouse button on it, the buttons are labeled:

  __DEAL__
 
  >  Start a new game by dealing new cards.

  __QUIT__
 
  >  Exit the game

  __HELP__
 
  >  This help page

  Note that the screen may be updated at any time using "_C-l_".


## NOTES


  __Patience__ is a macro defined in `patience.emf`.

  The game is best played with a mouse, it is possible to play with the
  keyboard, as follows:-

   "_esc h_" for help

  To move a card between stacks enter the source and destination column
  number ("_1_","_2_",.."_7_"). To move from the dealer pile then the source
  is the "_space_" key.

  "_tab_" deals the next cards.

  To overturn a card on the row stacks then enter the card column twice
  i.e. source and destination are the same.

  To move a card from the row to the suit stacks then either enter the
  card column twice, or enter the destination as "_h_","_d_","_c_","_s_" (i.e.
  "_2 2_" or "_2 s_" to move the card in column 2 to the spades stack).

  "_C-c C-c_" to deal the cards again.

  "_C-l_" redraw the screen.

  "_q_" to quit the game.

## SYNOPSIS


  __Triangle__


## DESCRIPTION


  __Triangle__ is a solitaire game using a standard set of playing cards. The
  object of the game is to use all of the cards in the deck to build up four
  suit stacks from Ace to King.

  The board is laid out so that every card is used to create a triangle
  shape. In the first column there is one up-turned card, in the second
  column there is one down-turned card and 2 up-turned, third has 2 down 3
  up etc. The only break form this pattern is in the last 3 columns where
  there is an extra up-turned card so that all the deck is used.

  Cards may be moved around the playing area by stacking the same suit cards
  in descending order on the row stacks. When a row stack has no up-turned
  cards on the stack then the top card may be turned over and may be played.
  If a stack becomes empty then only a King may be moved into the vacant
  position.

  If the last card in a stack is an Ace then it can be moved to its suit
  stack, then the 2 of that suit etc. until finally the King is removed.

  Cards are moved around the board using the mouse. Cards may be moved from
  one row stack to another row stack by placing the mouse over the 'from'
  stack and pressing the left mouse button. Move the cursor to the 'to'
  stack and release the left mouse button. If the move is legal then the
  card(s) are moved to the new stack. Multiple cards may be moved from the
  row stacks, the appropriate card(s) to be moved is automatically
  determined.

  Cards may be moved onto the suit stacks by a single left mouse press and
  release on the same card, the card is moved to the appropriate suit stack.
  The same technique is used to turn cards over in the suit stacks.

  Note that once a card is played onto the suit stacks then it cannot be
  removed.

  To the right of the board are a number of control buttons. To select an
  option, click the left mouse button on it, the buttons are labeled:

  __c-hash-del__  
  __c-hash-set-define__ "_variable_" "_value_"  
  __c-hash-unset-define__ "_variable_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __c-hash-eval__ evaluates C/C++ '#' lines, hiding sections of code which have
  been 'hashed' out. __c-hash-eval__ evaluates the following '#' lines:-

      #define <variable> ....
      #ifdef <variable>
      #if ...
      #else
      #endif

  For `#define`s __c-hash-eval__ creates a user variable "`%cd<variable>`", setting
  it to the value found. For `#ifdef` a simple check for the existence of
  variable "`%cd<variable>`" is made. If defined then code between the `#ifdef`
  and either its matching `#else` or `#endif` is displayed and code between the
  `#else` and `#endif` is hidden. If it is not defined then the reverse happens.

  The state of `#if`'s are evaluated using [calc(3)](calc(3)), the following code is then
  displayed as for `#ifdef`.

  Code is hidden by setting the [$line-scheme(5)]($line-scheme(5)) to a color similar to the
  back-ground. If an argument is given to the command the code is also
  narrowed out using [narrow-buffer(2)](narrow-buffer(2)).

  __c-hash-del__ undoes the effect of __c-hash-eval__ by restores hidden code.

  __c-hash-set-define__ and __c-hash-unset-define__ can be used to manually set and
  unset `#define` variables.


## NOTES


  __c-hash-eval__, __c-hash-del__, __c-hash-set-define__ and __c-hash-unset-define__ are
  macros defined in `cmacros.emf`.

  Executing __c-hash-eval__ in a project header file (h file) which contains all
  used `#define` definitions will set up all `#define` variables ready for the
  main C files.

## NAME


  etfinsrt        - Insert template file into current buffer  
  insert-template - insert template with an interactive menu
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __etfinsrt__ "_template_"  
  _n_ __insert-template__ 


## DESCRIPTION


  __etfinsrt__ is generally called by file hooks when the new buffer has been
  created as opposed to loaded from a file (see [$buffer-fhook(5)]($buffer-fhook(5))).

  __etfinsrt__ uses [&find(4)](&find(4)) to locate and insert the required "_template_.etf"
  file. If successful, __etfinsrt__ then replaces the following strings in the
  template:

  `$ASCII_TIME$`
  
  >  To the current time. Inserts the output of [ascii-time(3)](ascii-time(3)). The default
     format of the time string may be changed with [.ascii-time.format(5)](.ascii-time.format(5)).

  `$BUFFER_NAME$`
  
  >  To the buffer name. The name is capitalized, '.'s are replaced with
     '_' and any trailing "_<##>_" digits (used to make the buffer name
     unique) are removed.

  `$COMPANY_NAME$`
  
  >  To the value of __%company-name__, or if not defined to the value used for
     `$USER_NAME$`. __%company-name__ is usually set up in the company setup file
     defined in User setup.

  `$USER_NAME$`
  
  >  To the value of the registry entry "`/history/user-name`", or if not
     defined to the value "`<unknown>`". The user name is usually set up in
     the User setup dialog.

  `$YEAR$`
  
  >  To the current year (4 digit number).

  `$CURSOR$`
  
  >  To leave the cursor at this point, only one of these tokens should be
     used in the template and the token is removed.

   __insert-template__ can be used to insert a different than the default language
   templates  by  adding  these   template  files with the etf  extension  to
   the users users-path folder. If not given a numeric argument it invokes 
   a menu for interactive template selection. Templates can be as well added
   to sub  folders in the  users-path  directory  where the folder name has to
   correspond  to the  file-hook  name, so emf templates  must be in a folder
   "emf", Markdown templates in a folder "md" etc.
    

## EXAMPLE


  The following is taken from "_hkmake.emf_" and inserts the "_makefile.etf_"
  template if the buffer has been created.

```{.emf}
        define-macro fhook-make
            ; if arg is 0 this is a new file so add template
            !if &not @#
                etfinsrt "makefile"
            !endif
            set-variable $buffer-hilight .hilight.make
            -1 buffer-mode "tab"  ; Normal tabs please !!!
            1 buffer-mode "indent"
            1 buffer-mode "time"
        !emacro
```
  
  For a set of Python  template  files  create a folder  "python" in your Jasspa
  users  folder, on Linux  usually  _~/.jasspa_  in this folder place a set of
  etf-files like for instance  "class.etf",  "funcdoc.etf". If you now execute
  the command  __insert-template__  these two files will be  suggested  in the
  interactive menu at the command line if you press two times the TAB key.
  
   
## NOTES


  __etfinsrt__ is a macro defined in `etfinsrt.emf`.
    
  __insert-macro__ is a macro defined in `etfinsrt.emf`.

  [magic(2m)](magic(2m)) mode is always used to perform the the search/replace so the

## NAME


  ascii-time - Return the current time as a string
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __ascii-time__


## DESCRIPTION


  __ascii-time__ returns the current time as a formatted string in `#p9` which is
  equivalent to `#l9` for the calling macro. The format of the resultant
  string is determined by the variable __.ascii-time.format__ which is defined
  using the following escape characters:

     `%% ` - `%` char
     `%Y ` - 4 digit year
     `%y ` - 2 digit year
     `%B ` - Full month word
     `%b ` - 3 letter month
     `%m ` - 2 digit month
     `%#m` - 1 digit month
     `%d ` - 2 digit day
     `%#d` - 1 digit day
     `%A ` - Fill Week day word
     `%a ` - 3 letter week day
     `%H ` - 2 digit 24 hour
     `%M ` - 2 digit minute
     `%S ` - 2 digit second

  The default value of __.ascii-time.format__ when not defined is:

      "`%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y`"

  To change the default date layout then __.ascii-time.format__ should be
  defined in _user___.emf__. i.e.

```{.emf}
        set-variable .ascii-time.format "%H:%M:%S %Y-%m-%d"

```

## EXAMPLE


  The following is taken from etfinsrt.emf, it uses __ascii-time__ in replacing
  "`$ASCII_TIME$`" with the current.

```{.emf}
        0 define-macro etfinsrt
            .
            .
            ; Change the create date $ASCII_TIME$.
            beginning-of-buffer
            ; Get ASCII time in #l9
            ascii-time
            !force replace-string "\\$ASCII_TIME\\$" #l9
            .
            .
        !emacro

```

## NOTES


  __ascii-time__ is a macro defined in `utils.emf`.

! 3 replace-all-pairs
## NAME


  replace-all-pairs - Replace string pairs in a list of files
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __replace-all-pairs__ "_files_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __replace-all-pairs__ uses the current buffer to extract "_from_" and "_to_" pairs
  and then replaces all occurrences of "_from_" to "_to_" in the given list of
  files without prompting the user. An optional third argument "_grep_" can be
  given which will be used as the grep string, if not given the "_from_"
  string is used. The format of the current buffer must be:

     /from1/to1/
     Xfrom2Xto2X
     ?from3?to3?
     /from4/to4/grep4/
          .
          .
     /fromN/toN/


  For each pair the command finds all occurrences of "_from_" (or "_grep_" if
  specified) by calling the command [grep(3)](grep(3)) to search for string "_from_" in
  files "_files_". Thus all relevant edited files must be saved or __grep__ may
  return the wrong line numbers. This is achieved by a call to
  [save-some-buffers(2)](save-some-buffers(2)) between each replace pair, it is called with an
  argument of 0 to ensure that any changed buffers are automatically saved.

  Each occurrence of "_from_" is jumped to using [get-next-line(2)](get-next-line(2)) and the
  string is replaced by the call:

```{.emf}
        -1 replace-string "from" "to"

```

  This replaces all occurrences of "_from_" to "_to_" on the current line only,
  hence the line numbers must be correct. This also means that the "_from_"
  search string must be correctly formatted for both grep and
  replace-string.

  The given argument _n_ is a bit based flag which changes the default
  behavior described above. The bits have the following effect:-

  __0x01__
 
  >  Prompt before saving any changed buffers FIRST time ONLY, enabled by
     default. If set then the user is also prompted to continue before any
     changes are made. If this bit is not set then the command executes
     without any user input.


## NOTES


  __replace-all-pairs__ is a macro defined in `search.emf`.

  The __grep__ command must be working before this command can function
  properly.

  It is not recommended to use a "from" or "to" string which uses more that
  one line as the results may be unpredictable.

  As the change is likely to be several pair strings with each changed
  buffer being saved between pairs [undo(2)](undo(2)) cannot be used to undo the
  changes. Neither can the backups be relied on as a buffer may be saved
  more than once in this process, therefore it is strongly recommend that a
  backup of the files is made before commencing with this command.

! 3 delete-indentation
## NAME


  delete-indentation - Join 2 lines deleting white spaces
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __delete-indentation__


## DESCRIPTION


  __delete-indentation__ deletes all white characters between the beginning of
  the current line and the end of the previous line, including the
  line-feed. If the current line is not empty then a space is inserted to
  divide the two lines now joined.

  If a positive argument _n_ is given then the process is repeated _n_ times.
  Note that the deleted characters are not added to a kill buffer.

! 3 edit-dictionary
! 3 restore-dictionary
## NAME


|edit-dictionary
  edit-dictionary - Insert a dictionary in a buffer
|restore-dictionary
  restore-dictionary - Save dictionary user changes
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __edit-dictionary__ "_dictionary_"  
  __restore-dictionary__


## DESCRIPTION


  __edit-dictionary__ dumps the contents of "_dictionary_" into the temporary
  buffer "*_dictionary_*", if this buffer already exists then __edit-dictionary__
  simply swaps to this buffer. This enables the user to correct and prune
  the words in any dictionary. The given dictionary must have already been
  added as a main dictionary using [add-dictionary(2)](add-dictionary(2)).

  The format of the created buffer is one word on each line, each word takes
  one of the following 3 forms:

     `xxxx` - Good word `xxxx` with no spell rules allowed
     `xxxx/abc` - Good word `xxxx` with spell rules `abc` allowed
     `xxxx>yyyy` - Erroneous word with an auto-replace to `yyyy`

  Executing __restore-dictionary__ in a buffer created by __edit-dictionary__ will
  first call [delete-dictionary(2)](delete-dictionary(2)) to remove the original dictionary from
  memory. It then uses [add-dictionary(2)](add-dictionary(2)) to create a new dictionary with the
  same name and then uses [spell-add-word(3)](spell-add-word(3)) to add all the words in the
  current buffer into the new dictionary.

  __restore-dictionary__ does not save the new dictionary.


## NOTES


  __edit-dictionary__ and __restore-dictionary__ are macros defined in file
  `spellutl.emf`. They are not defined by default so _spellutl.emf_ must be
  executed first using [execute-file(2)](execute-file(2)).

## SYNOPSIS

## DESCRIPTION


  __spell-add-word__ adds words to the last dictionary added using the command
  [add-dictionary(2)](add-dictionary(2)). If no argument is supplied the user is prompted for the
  word and rule flags, only a 'Good' word can be added (see below). If an
  argument _n_ is given then the next _n_ words from the current buffer are
  added. The words must take one of the following three forms:

     `xxxx` - Good word `xxxx` with no spell rules allowed
     `xxxx/abc` - Good word `xxxx` with spell rules `abc` allowed
     `xxxx>yyyy` - Erroneous word with an auto-replace to `yyyy`

! 3 start-up
! 3 shut-down
## NAME


|start-up
  start-up - Editor startup callback command
|shut-down
  shut-down - Editor exit callback command
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __start-up__  
  __shut-down__


## DESCRIPTION


  By default __start-up__ is not defined, if the command is defined (via a user
  macro) then it is executed immediately after MicroEmacs 2009 has completed
  its initialization.

  This command may initially seem redundant as the user may execute any
  command at start-up by editing the "`me.emf`" file or using the '__@__'
  command-line argument. At the point of "`me.emf`" file execution none of the
  files specified on the command-line will be loaded, thus any actions
  required on the given command-line files will not work (the only buffer
  present will be the "__*scratch*__" buffer).

  The __start-up__ command is executed AFTER the execution of "`me.emf`" and
  initialization of buffers, but before MicroEmacs 2009 waits for user
  input.

  The __shut-down__ command is also not defined by default, but if it is defined
  during the running of MicroEmacs the command will be called when
  MicroEmacs exits. The command is not called if MicroEmacs has to perform
  an emergency exit (due to the system being shut down or process being
  killed etc).

## DESCRIPTION


  __restyle-buffer__ automatically re-formats the indentation of a buffer. The
  indentation only operates if the indentation method is defined with
  [$buffer-indent(5)]($buffer-indent(5)), otherwise the command has no effect.

  __restyle-region__ modifies the indentation between _point_ and _mark_.

## DESCRIPTION


  __ifill-paragraph__, like __fill-paragraph__, fills the current paragraph from the
  left margin to the current fill column. In addition ifill-paragraph also
  recognizes joined bullet lists and fills each bullet paragraph separately.

  See [fill-paragraph(2)](fill-paragraph(2)) for more information on the process of filling
  paragraphs.


## EXAMPLE


  Following are 2 copies of the same paragraph, the first has been filled
  using __ifill-paragraph__:

## NAME


  file-browser - Browse the file system file-browser-close - Close the  
  file-browser file-browser-swap-buffers - Swap between file-browser windows
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __file-browser__ (__f10__)  
  __file-browser-close__  
  __file-browser-swap-buffers__


## DESCRIPTION


  __file-browser__ can be used to browse around the file system. When first
  executed __file-browser__ creates 2 buffers, "`*directory*`" displaying the
  directory structure and "`*files*`" listing the files in the current
  directory with information on each file. __file-browser__ displays these
  buffers side by side, splitting the current window horizontally if
  required. __file-browser__ uses a single window only when invoked with a
  numerical argument _n_ of zero (0).

  Once open the user can browse through the system using the following keys
  in the `*directory*` buffer, use __esc-h__ for help within the buffer:

  `space`
  
  >  Selects the directory on the current line and up-dates the `*files*`
     buffer with the information on this directory. This can also be done
     by clicking the left mouse button on the directory name.

  `return`
  
  >  Selects the directory on the current line, if open (sub-directories
     displayed) then closes it or if closed it is opened. The `*files*`
     buffer is up-dated with the information on the directory. This can
     also be done by clicking the left mouse button on the '`+`' or '`-`'
     symbol just before the directory name.

  `C-return`
  
  >  As with `return` expect sub-directories are recursively opened or
     closed, note that this could take some time on large file systems.
     This can also be done by clicking the right mouse button on the '`+`' or
     '`-`' symbol just before the directory name.

  `tab`
  
  >  Move to the `*files*` buffer.

  `f10`
  
  >  Closes file-browser.

  The following keys can be used in the `*files*` buffer:

  `return`
  
  >  If the current line is a directory, this because the current
     directory, updating both the `*directory*` and `*files*` buffers. If the
     line is a file then it is opened using [find-file(2)](find-file(2)). This can also be
     done by clicking the left mouse button on the file name.

  >  Where a __file-tool__ open action has been defined using
     [file-tool-setup(3)](file-tool-setup(3)) then the selected tool or utility is run to process
     the file. This may be used to launch viewers for PDF, image files etc.

  `space`
  
  >  Toggles the tag state of the file on the current line, see `x` command.
     This can also be done by clicking the left mouse button anywhere
     before the file name, or for multiple files drag a region with the
     left mouse button.

  `X` or `x`
  
  >  Executes a [shell-command(2)](shell-command(2)) on all tagged files. The user is prompted
     for the command line which can contain the following special tokens:  

            %p  Full file name, including path.
            %f  The file name without the path.

  >  As the __shell-command__ is executed in the directory `%f` is safe to use in
     a command such as "`del %f`".

  `D` or `d` or `delete`
  
  >  Delete selected files or current file/directory.

  `tab`
  
  >  Move to the `*directory*` buffer.

  `backspace`
  
  >  Move to the parent directory.

  `l`
  
  >  Refresh the listing from the file system.

  `f`
  
  >  Toggle the filter, enables/disables the display of back-up, object
     files etc.

  `S`
  
  >  Initiates a search for files, at the command prompt then enter the
     leading characters to search for use __C-s__ and __C-r__ to search forwards or
     backwards respectively. The `s` version of this command is an
     incremental search and is easier to use.

  `s`
  
  >  Launch an incremental search by name, at the prompt enter the search
     characters, use __C-s__ and __C-r__ to search forwards or backwards
     respectively.

  `1`
  
  >  Sort list by selected state.

  `2`
  
  >  Sort list by attribute.

  `3`
  
  >  Sort list by size.

  `4`
  
  >  Sort list by modified time.

  `5`
  
  >  Sort list by name.

  `6`
  
  >  Sort list by extension.

  `space` or `+`
  
  >  Select file.

  `-`
  
  >  Unselect file.

  `*`
  
  >  Invert selection.

  `a`
  
  >  Select all.

  `u`
  
  >  Unselect all.

  `e`
  
  >  Edit file, opens the file in the editor for modification.

  `i`
  
  >  Edit selected file, opens all of the selected file in the editor for
     modification.

  `v`
  
  >  View file, opens file for viewing only (write protected).

  `r`
  
  >  Rename file or directory, command line prompt for the new name.

  `c`
  
  >  Copy file(s) and/or directory(s), command line prompt for directory to
     copy file(s).

  `m`
  
  >  Move file(s) and/or directory(s), command line prompt for directory to
     move file(s).

  `n`
  
  >  Create a new directory (or folder), command line prompt for the name
     of the new directory to create.

  `t`
  
  >  Invokes the file tools menu to process the file, see
     [file-tool-setup(3)](file-tool-setup(3)).

  __file-browser-swap-buffers__ swaps between the `*directory*` and `*file*`
  windows, making the other the current window, this is usually locally
  bound to the `tab` key.

  __file-browser-close__ hides both the `*directory*` and `*file*` windows, closing
  the file-browser, this is usually locally bound to the `f10` key. Note that
  this command is hidden and will not complete on the command line, but may
  be bound or input explicitly.

  The command line mapping was revised in the 2006 release for a more
  logical key to file operation mapping.

|mail-check
  mail-check - Check for new email
|stop-mail-check
  stop-mail-check - Disable the check for new email
|mail
  mail - Compose and send an email
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __vm__  
  __mail-check__  
  __stop-mail-check__  
  __mail__


## DESCRIPTION


  __vm__ is a simple email manager, it is configured to send and receive emails
  using the [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) Mail dialog.

  __mail-check__ tests the size of this incoming mail box, a non-zero length
  indicates that new mail has arrived and __mail-check__ informs the user by
  inserting a '`M`' in the mode-line (2nd character for the left) and ringing
  the system bell. __mail-check__ uses [create-callback(2)](create-callback(2)) to check for new mail
  every 10 minutes, this can be disabled by executing __stop-mail-check__.

  When __vm__ is executed it checks for new mail, if found it first copies the
  new mail to a file called "`new_mail`" in the users mail directory. The
  incoming box is then emptied by truncating the file to zero length. The
  users main mail box is then loaded and the new mail (if any) is appended.
  The mail box is then processed after which 2 windows are created the
  bottom window listing all messages in the box and the top displaying the
  current message.

  __vm__ is capable of:

  - Scrolling through the mail box displaying each message (`up`, `p`, `down`,
        n, return, space).
  - Check and get new mail messages (`g`).
  - Extract and cut embedded data files (`x`, `C`, `c`).
  - Reply to and forward mail messages (`R`, `r`, `z`).
  - Delete mail messages (`d`, `u`).
  - Archive messages to other mail boxes (`A`, `a`).
  - Save changes to the current mail box (`S`, `s`).
  - Delete the current mail box (`D`).
  - Visit another mail box (`v`).
  - Send a mail message (`m`).
  - Hide vm windows (`delete`).

  Use the vm help page (bound to "`esc h`") for further information.

  __vm__ supports two types of embedded data, uuencode and mime encoding and
  uses [ipipe-shell-command(2)](ipipe-shell-command(2)) to extract the data, the commanding to use
  must be supplied by the user using the setup dialog, which can contain the
  following special tokens:

  `%i`
  
  >  Temporary file name, if used, the embedded data is written to the this
     file first.

  `%o`
  
  >  User supplied output file name, if `%i` is not used, the embedded data
     is written to this file first.

  `%b`
  
  >  The output base name, i.e. `%o` without the path.

  If no command line is supplied then the embedded data is written to the
  user supplied file name as a text file in the form found in the mail
  message.

  __mail__ can be used to compose and send an email, it can insert embedded data
  in a similar way to __vm__'s data extraction, the following special tokens can
  be used:

  `%i`
  
  >  The user supplied data file to be embedded.

  `%b`
  
  >  The input base name, i.e. `%i` without the path.

  `%o`
  
  >  Temporary file name used to output the processed data file, this file
     is inserted into the mail message using [insert-file(2)](insert-file(2)).

  __mail__ also uses __ipipe-shell-command__ to send the mail message, the following
  special tokens can be used:

  `%f`
  
  >  The from user name.

  `%s`
  
  >  The email subject.

  `%t`
  
  >  A comma separated list of 'To' recipients.

  `%c`
  
  >  A comma separated list of 'Cc' recipients.

  `%o`
  
  >  A file name of the mail message.

  Any field not used in the command-line is left at the head of the mail
  message.


## EXAMPLE - UNIX


  The following command-line can be used on most UNIX systems to extract
  uuencoded data:

      rm -f %o ; uudecode %i ; rm -f %i


  The following command-line can be used on most UNIX systems to extract
  mime encoded data:

      rm -f /tmp/%b ; metamail -B -d -q -w -x -z %i ; mv -f /tmp/%b %o


  The following command-line can be used on most UNIX systems to uuencode a
  data file ready for it to be embedded, the original file is not changed:

      uuencode %b < %i > %o


  The following command-line can be used on most UNIX systems to send an
  email:

      /usr/lib/sendmail -oi -oem -odi -t < %o


## EXAMPLE - WIN32


  Typically the __cygwin(1)__ utilities can be used for data insertion and
  extraction. These have the advantage of being very similar to the unix
  ones so only minor changes are required, i.e. try the following for data
  insertion and mime & uuencode extraction respectively:

      del %o ^ uudecode %i ^ del %i
      del c:\tmp\%b ^ metamail -B -d -q -w -x -z %i ^ move c:\tmp\%b %o
      uuencode %b < %i > %o


  This assumes that the shell you are using supports the '`^`' multiple
  commands on a single line feature, this is supported by __4dos(1)__ and
  __4nt(1)__. If your shell does not support this feature a simple batch file
  command could be used instead.

  __postie(1)__ is a freely available pop3/smpt e-mail support program,
  available on the net, which can be used to provide a fully working __vm__ on
  windows systems. As it is typically used in a dial-up connect environment,
  the __user-setup__ 'Queue Outgoing Mail' option will be enabled while the
  'Check Mail' and 'VM Gets Mail' will be disabled. This ensures that a
  connection is only made when the __vm__ '`g`' command is used which sets all
  queued outgoing mail and gets any incoming mail.

  The following command-line can be used to get mail from your pop server
  using postie:

      postie -host:pop-mail-addr -user:user-addr -pass:password -file:inbox
                "-sep:From root Mon Jan 11 20:02:02 1999" -raw -rm


  Where the `inbox` is the 'Incoming Mail Box' file specified in user-setup.
  The `-sep` option is used to partition each mail message from the previous
  message, this string is used as it is in a unix standard form so the
  resulting mail box could be understood by unix mail systems such as
  netscape etc.

  NOTE: The __-rm__ option is used to remove the incoming mail messages from the
  server. It is strongly recommended that the system is thoroughly tested
  without this option first.

  The following command-line can be used to send mail to your smtp server
  using postie:

      postie -host:smtp-mail-addr "-from:user@mail-addr" -use_mime:0
                "-to:%t" "-s:%s" "-cc:%c" "-file:%o"


  __blat(1)__ is another freely available windows program which can be used to
  send mail with the following command-line:

      blat %o -f %f -s \"%s\" -t \"%t\" -c \"%c\"


## NOTES


  __vm__ is a macro defined in `vm.emf`, __mail-check__, __stop-mail-check__ and __mail__ are
  macros defined in `mail.emf`.

  __vm__ has only been tested in a couple of environments, the author will not
  except any responsibility for any loss of data, i.e. use at your own
  peril. You have been warned! Back-up all data files and test __vm__ THOROUGHLY
  before using it.

## NAME


|collapse-current
  collapse-current - (un)Fold a region in the current buffer
|collapse-all
  collapse-all - (Un)Fold all regions in the current buffer
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __collapse-current__  
  __collapse-all__


## DESCRIPTION


  MicroEmacs 2009 provides a generic, albeit coarse, folding mechanism which
  is applied to some of the well known file modes. The folding mechanism
  allows parts of the buffer to be scrolled up and hidden, leaving a residue
  hilighting marker within the buffer indicating a folded region. A folded
  buffer typically allows a summary of the buffer contents to be viewed
  within several windows, hiding the detail of the buffer. 

  The folding mechanism uses well defined _start_ and _end_ markers which form
  part of the syntax of the well known file mode. i.e. in 'C' this is the
  open and closed braces that appear on the left-hand margin (`{` .. `}`). The
  intention is that the natural syntax of the text is used to determine the
  fold positions, requiring no additional text formating or special text
  tags to be inserted by the user.

  __collapse-current__ opens and closes a folded region within the buffer. If
  the current cursor position lies between a _start_ and _end_ marker then the
  region between the start and end is folded out and hidden from view,
  leaving a highlight marker in the buffer. If the fold already exists then,
  moving the cursor to the folded line and invoking __collapse-current__ removes
  the fold marker and reveals the text.

  __collapse-all__ opens and closes all folded regions within the buffer, if the
  current state is unfolded then all of the _start_/_end_ markers are located
  and their regions folded. Conversely, if the buffer is currently folded
  and __collapse-all__ is invoked, then all folds are removed and the associated
  text revealed.


## CONFIGURATION


  In order to utilize the __collapse-current/all__ commands within a buffer, the
  _start_ and _end_ markers have to be initialized for the syntactical contents
  of the buffer. This is performed within the hook function for the buffer,
  using the hook-name, the initialization is performed within
  [buffer-init(3)](buffer-init(3)). Buffer specific variables are defined within the context
  of the buffer to configure that start and end fold handling. The buffer
  specific variables are defined as follows, where _XXX_ is the file hook base
  name.

  __.fhook-XXX-collapse-open__
  
  >  A regular expression search string used to locate the start of the
     string. For speed the search string should include a regular
     expression start or end of line character whenever possible. i.e. in C
     the open is defined as "`^{`".

  __.fhook-XXX-collapse-close__
  
  >  A regular expression search string used to locate the end of the
     string. For speed the search string should include a regular
     expression start or end line character whenever possible. i.e. in C
     the close is defined as "`^}`".

  __.fhook-XXX-collapse-mopen__
  
  >  An integer value that denotes the number of lines to move in a forward
     or (negative n) backward direction from the _start_ line located by the
     search string to the position in the buffer to be folded. If default
     value when __mopen__ is omitted is 0, starting the fold from the search
     string line.

  __.fhook-XXX-collapse-mclose__
  
  >  The relative displacement from the close fold line to the fold
     position, this is a positive or negative displacement depending on
     where the fold is to be positioned.

  __.fhook-XXX-collapse-mnext__
  
  >  Specifies the number of lines to advance before the next search is
     continued on the fold operation. This is only used by __collapse-all__.


## PRESENTATION


  The presentation of a collapsed region takes the form:

  >  _<open line string>_ ... _<close line string>_

  Where _<open line string>_ and _<close line string>_ are automatically
  extracted from the originating buffer using the search string definition.
  Existing __collapse__ implementations used a simpler format:

  >  _<open line string>_ ...

  In MicroEmacs '04 and later versions, then the _<close line string>_ is
  always appended. Appending of the closing token is required to ensure that
  any [indentation](indent(2)) is maintained. This allows the indent processing to find
  both an _open_ and _close_ character sequence and not introduce an unwanted
  indentation. To ensure that indentation consistency is maintained then the
  __.fhook-XXX.collapse-close__ definition should minimally match the
  corresponding indentation close regular expression.


## EXAMPLE


  The following examples show how the collapse variables are set up in each
  of the buffer modes.


## C and C++ 


  __C__ and __C++__ collapse on the open and close brace appearing in the left-hand
  margin. The collapse variables are defined in `hkc`/`hkcpp.emf` as follows:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-open  "^{"
        set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-close "^}"
        set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-mopen  "-1"
        set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-mclose "1"
        set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-mnext "-1"

```

  Given a 'C' function definition:-

     static void
     myfunc (int a, int b)
     {
            /* Function body */
     }


  the folded version appears as follows:-

     static void
     myfunc (int a, int b) ... }


## emf 


  MicroEmacs macro files __emf__ support folding of macro definitions, the
  collapse variables are defined in `hkemf.emf` as follows:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable .fhook-emf.collapse-open  "^0? ?define-macro[ \t]"
        set-variable .fhook-emf.collapse-close "^!emacro"
        set-variable .fhook-emf.collapse-mclose "1"
        set-variable .fhook-emf.collapse-mnext "-1"

```

  Given a macro definition:-

```{.emf}
        0 define-macro mymacro
        ; This is the body of the macro
        ; ... and some more ...
        !emacro

```

  the collapsed version of the macro is defined as:-

```{.emf}
        0 define-macro mymacro ... !emacro

```

## nroff 


  __nroff__ is configured for manual pages only and folds between `.SH` and `.SS`
  sections, the hook variables are defined as follows:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable .fhook-nroff.collapse-open  "^\.S[SH]"
        set-variable .fhook-nroff.collapse-close "^\.S[SH]\|\'"
        set-variable .fhook-nroff.collapse-mnext "-1"

```

  Given an nroff block of text defined as:-

     .SH SYNOPSIS
     .\" Some text
     .\" Some more text
     .SH DESCRIPTION


  Then the collapsed version appears as:

     .SH SYNOPSIS
     .SH DESCRIPTION


## tcl/tk 


  __tcl/tk__ is configured to collapse procedures. The collapse variables are
  defined as:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable .fhook-tcl.collapse-open  "^proc "
        set-variable .fhook-tcl.collapse-close "^}"
        set-variable .fhook-tcl.collapse-mclose "1"
        set-variable .fhook-tcl.collapse-mnext "-1"

```

  Given a tcl procedure definition:-

     proc tixControl:InitWidgetRec {w} {
            upvar #0 $w data

            tixChainMethod $w InitWidgetRec

            set data(varInited)   0
            set data(serial) 0
     }


  The collapsed version of the same section appears as:-

     proc tixControl:InitWidgetRec {w} { ... }


## NOTES


  __collapse-current__ and __collapse-all__ are macros implemented in `collapse.emf`.
  The collapsing is performed using the [narrow-buffer(2)](narrow-buffer(2)) command.

  __collapse-current__ may also be bound to the mouse using the [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)).
  The typical binding is `C-mouse-drop-1`.


## HISTORY


  __collapse__ is the new name for __fold__ appearing in MicroEmacs 2004 version.
  The existing commands of __fold-current__ and __fold-all__ have been replaced by
  __collapse-current__ and __collapse-all__ respectively. __collapse__ now uses the
  private command variables.

## NAME


|find-bfile
  find-bfile - Load a file as binary data
|find-cfile
  find-cfile - Load a crypted file
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __find-bfile__ "_file-name_" (__C-x 9__)  
  _n_ __find-cfile__ "_file-name_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __find-bfile__ and __find-cfile__ provide a simple interface to loading files in
  [binary(2m)](binary(2m)) and [crypt(2m)](crypt(2m)) modes respectively. The numeric argument has the
  same effect as with the [find-file(2)](find-file(2)) command except the respective modes
  are always enabled. See documentation on the modes an __find-file__ command
  for more information.


## NOTES


  __find-bfile__ and __find-cfile__ are macros defined in file `tools.emf`.

  The command [find-file(2)](find-file(2)) is bound to key "`C-x 9`" with a numeric argument
  of 2, this is equivalent to executing __find-bfile__ with no argument.

## NAME


|man
  man - UNIX manual page viewer.
|man-clean
  man-clean - Clean UNIX manual page.
|%man-com
  %man-com - Man Command line
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __man__  
  __man-clean__  
  __%man-com__


## DESCRIPTION


  __man__ provides a mechanism to display a UNIX manual page within the
  MicroEmacs window. On invoking __man__ the user is prompted for the name of
  the manual page to display:-

      Man on ?


  The name of the manual page (and any options) are entered on the command
  line. The macro invokes the UNIX utility __man(1)__ to generate the page and
  displays the results in a window. The man page executable may be defined
  with the variable __%man-com__ this is defined as `man` by default.

  Another manual page can be selected by either moving the cursor to the
  link and pressing return or double clicking on it with the left mouse
  button. MicroEmacs will then attempt to load and display the selected
  manual page.

  __man-clean__ removes any man-page formatting codes from the current buffer
  reducing a manual page to plain text. The formatting codes are used to
  create the bold and underline fonts. This allows the page to be treated as
  a normal buffer, i.e. string searches and other similar command will work
  as expected.


## NOTES


  __man__ and __man-clean__ are macros defined in `hkman.emf`.

  __man__ is only made available within UNIX environments, the UNIX start up
  file `unixterm.emf` links in the macro. If the __man__ utility is required on
  other platforms then the following definition is required in a start-up
  file.

```{.emf}
        define-macro-file hkman man

```

  On Microsoft Windows environments, if the __cygwin__ directory is located then
  __man__ is enabled and uses the __cygwin__ __man(1)__ utility and manual pages.

! 3 draw
## NAME


  draw - Simple line drawing utility
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __draw__


## DESCRIPTION


  __draw__ provides a simple way of drawing lines into the current buffer, this
  has a variety of uses such as drawing tables. __draw__ copies the current
  buffer into a temporary buffer and then allows the user to draw using
  simple commands until the user either aborts, discarding any changes, or
  exits insert the changes back into the buffer.

  The keys for __draw__ are defined as follows:-

  __esc h__
  
  >  Display a help dialog.

  __up__, __down__, __left__, __right__
  
  >  The cursor keys (or any other keys bound the the same commands) will
     move the cursor, drawing in the current mode.

  __d__
  
  >  Change the current mode to __d__raw (default), cursor movement will result
     in drawing in the current style.

  __e__
  
  >  Change the current mode to __e__rase, cursor movement will result in
     erasing to spaces.

  __m__
  
  >  Change the current mode to __m__ove, no drawing is performed with cursor
     movement.

  __u__
  
  >  Change the current mode to __u__ndo, cursor movement will result in
     undoing the character to the original or a space.

  __-__
  
  >  Sets the current horizontal line drawing style to use '`-`'s (default).

  __=__
  
  >  Sets the current horizontal line drawing style to use '`=`'s.

  __C-g__
  
  >  Abort - changes are lost.

  __return__
  
  >  Exit, inserting any changes into the current buffer.


## NOTES


  __draw__ is a macro defined in `draw.emf`.

  __cygwin__  

  __%cygwin-path__ "_path_"  
  __%cygwin-hilight__ [`0`|`1`]  
  __%cygwin-prompt__ "_hilightString_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __cygwin__ creates an interactive BASH shell window within a MicroEmacs buffer
  window, providing a UNIX command line facility within the Microsoft
  Windows environment. This is a preferable environment to the MS-DOS shell
  and is certainly far more comfortable for those familiar with UNIX.

  Within the window BASH commands may be entered and executed, the results
  are shown in the window. Within the context of the BASH shell window then
  directory naming conforms to the __cygwin__ standard conventions (as opposed
  to the Microsoft directory naming).

  On running __cygwin__ a new buffer is created called `*cygwin*` which contains
  the shell. Executing the command again creates a new shell window called
  `*cygwin1*`, and so on. If a cygwin window is killed off then the available
  window is used next time the command is run.

  Additional controls are available within the shell window to control the
  editors interaction with the window. The operating mode is shown as a
  digit on the buffer mode line (2/3/4) which is defined in the following
  sections. The operational mode is changed with the __F3__ function key.

  __Mode 2 - Browse Mode__
  
  >  Locks the window and allows local editing to be performed. All
     commands entered into the window are interpreted by the editor. Mode 2
     is typically entered to cut and paste from the window, search for text
     strings etc. In mode 2, a __2__ is shown on the mode line.

  __Mode 3 - Semi-immersion__
  
  >  The normal operating mode, text typed into the window is presented to
     the shell window. Translation of MicroEmacs commands (i.e.
     beginning-of-word) are translated and passed to the shell. For
     interactive use this is the default mode. In mode 3, a __3__ is shown on
     the mode line.

  __Mode 4 - Full Immersion__
  
  >  All input is passed to the shell, no MicroEmacs commands are
     interpreted and keys are passed straight to the shell window. This
     mode is used where none of the keys to be entered are to be
     interpreted by MicroEmacs. Note that you have to un-toggle mode 4
     before you can swap buffers as this effectively locks the editor into
     the window.

  __F5__
  
  >  Clears the buffer contents. This simply erases all of the historical
     information in the buffer. The operation of the shell is unaffected.

  To exit the shell then end the shell session using "`exit`" or "`C-d`" as
  normal and then close the buffer. A short cut "`C-c C-k`" is available to
  kill off the pipe. However, it is not recommended that this method is used
  as it effectively performs a hard kill of the buffer and attached process

  __%cygwin-path__ is a user defined variable that defines the file system
  location of the _cygwin_ directory, this is typically `c:/cygwin`. If _cygwin_
  is located at a different location then the variable MUST be defined
  within the user start up script in order for the __cygwin__ command to start
  the shell. With a default installation of _cygwin_ then the settings are
  typically defined as:-

  __Current Release__

```{.emf}
        set-variable %cygwin-path "c:/cygwin"

```

  __%cygwin-hilight__ is a boolean flag which controls how the cygwin command
  shell window is hilighted. This value MUST be defined within the user
  start up script prior to executing cygwin if hilighting is to be disabled;
  by default hilighting is enabled. A value of 0 disables shell hilighting
  i.e.

```{.emf}
        set-variable %cygwin-hilight 0

```

  __%cygwin-prompt__ is an optional variable that is used in conjunction with
  __%cygwin-hilight__, it defines the hilighting string identifying the prompt.
  This allows the prompt to be rendered with a different color. The default
  prompt is `bash-x.yyr$` and may be hilighted using a definition:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable %cygwin-prompt "bash-2.01$"

```

  The user typically overrides the prompt definition within the BASH startup
  file, a more appropriate definition of the prompt may be:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable %cygwin-prompt "^[a-z]*@[^>]*>"

```

## NOTES


  The __cygwin__ command uses the [ipipe-shell-command(2)](ipipe-shell-command(2)) to manage the pipe
  between the editor and the __bash__ shell. The window is controlled by the
  macro file `hkcygwin.emf` which controls the interaction with the shell.

  The macro __cygwin__ in `hkcygwin.emf` defines the parameter setup to connect to
  the cygwin bash shell, installed in the default location `c:/cygwin`. If
  your installation of cygwin is in a different location then correct the
  macro to match your install location, preferably correct by creating a
  _mycygwin.emf_ file in your user directory simply containing a re-defined
  __cygwin__ macro.

  If you have exported some of the cygwin environment variables in your
  `autoexec.bat` then you will have to figure out for yourself what variables
  macro _cygwin_ needs to export - the current configuration is for a vanilla
  install.

  The __bash__ shell is executed with options __-i__, for interactive shell and __-m__
  to enable job control.

  As of the 2004 release then the __Cygwin__/__Cygnus__ support has been revised in
  light of the changes in __cygwin__

  - Renamed the command from __cygnus__ to __cygwin__.
  - Following a change in the __bash(1)__ command line operation, which now
        no longer echos user input, then the user input is processed by
        MicroEmacs. This does cause some problems with completion as the
        Cygwin environment has a different name space. The completion still
        requires some more work, but sufficient for smaller tasks.


## TESTED CONFIGURATIONS


  This configuration has only been tested on a Windows 2000 installation,
  whether this works on Windows 95/98/NT is unknown while XP is very likely
  to work.

  We have only been running "make" operations in the shell and do not know
  how the likes of "more", "man" or anything other terminal interaction
  works.

  __Tested Configurations__
  
  >   Windows 2K (Pentium-4) and Windows 2K (SunPCi-III)

     cygwin latest version as of February 2004.


## BUGS


  __Break Key__
  
  >  A break in a bash shell is `C-c`, the macros define the key `C-c C-c` to
     perform the break. There does not appear to be a way to prevent this
     from happening as trapping the interrupt does not appear to be
     supported in Cygwin Bash i.e. "`trap` `''` `INT`".

  __Completion__
  
  >  Completion processing needs to be improved. The directory location is
     retrieved from __bash(1)__ on each command line prompt, this is used for
     file completion. There is no command completion. Room for some
     improvement here.

  Windows '95/'98/NT/2K/XP - win32  
  Unix - All variants.


## SYNOPSIS


  __ishell__  

  _[Windows Only]_  
  __$ME_ISHELL__ _= <comspec>_ 


## DESCRIPTION


  __ishell__ creates an interactive shell window within the a MicroEmacs buffer
  window, providing access to the native operating systems command shell.
  Within the window commands may be entered and executed, the results are
  shown in the window.

  On running __ishell__ a new buffer is created called `*shell*` which contains
  the shell. Executing the command again creates a new shell window called
  `*shell1*`, and so on. If a `*shell*` window is killed off then the available
  window is used next time the command is run.

  Additional controls are available within the shell window to control the
  editors interaction with the window. The operating mode is shown as a
  digit on the buffer mode line (2/3/4) which is defined in the following
  sections. The operational mode is changed with the __F3__ function key.

  __Mode 2 - Browse Mode__
  
  >  Locks the window and allows local editing to be performed. All
     commands entered into the window are interpreted by the editor. Mode 2
     is typically entered to cut and paste from the window, search for text
     strings etc. In mode 2, a __2__ is shown on the mode line.

  __Mode 3 - Semi-immersion__
  
  >  The normal operating mode, text typed into the window is presented to
     the shell window. Translation of MicroEmacs commands (i.e.
     beginning-of-word) are translated and passed to the shell. For
     interactive use this is the default mode. In mode 3, a __3__ is shown on
     the mode line.

  __Mode 4 - Full Immersion__
  
  >  All input is passed to the shell, no MicroEmacs commands are
     interpreted and keys are passed straight to the shell window. This
     mode is used where none of the keys to be entered are to be
     interpreted by MicroEmacs. Note that you have to un-toggle mode 4
     before you can swap buffers as this effectively locks the editor into
     the window.

  To exit the shell then end the shell session using the normal exit command
  i.e. "`exit`" or "`C-d`" as normal and then close the buffer. A short cut "C-c
  C-k" is available to kill off the pipe. However, it is not recommended
  that this method is used as it effectively performs a hard kill of the
  buffer and attached process.


## UNIX


  The UNIX environment uses the native __pty__ support of the operating system.
  The shell that is opened is determined by the conventional `$SHELL`
  environment variable.

  The shell window assumes that the user is running some sort of Emacs
  emulation on the command line (i.e. `VISUAL=emacs` for __ksh(1)__, __zsh(1)__,
  __bash(1)__, __tsch(1)__) and passes Emacs controls for command line editing.

  The shell window understands re-size operations and provides a limited
  decoding of the _termio_ characters for a VT100 screen. From within the
  shell window it is possible to run the likes of __top(1)__ correctly. It is
  even possible to run another MicroEmacs terminal session !!


## WINDOWS


  The Windows environment provides a very poor command shell facility, this
  is more of a fundamental problem with the operating system than anything
  else. Unfortunately NT/2K/XP are no better than Windows '95/'98, stemming
  from the fact that Microsoft Windows is actually a huge Window Manager
  (hindered by legacy issues of MS-DOS).

  For those familiar with the UNIX command shell then it is strongly
  recommended that the [cygwin(3)](cygwin(3)) BASH shell is used as an alternative. This
  is a far more responsive shell window and provides the familiar Emacs
  editing of the command line.

  The command shell under Microsoft Windows is slow and very unresponsive,
  this would appear to be a problem with the _command.com_ as the same
  problems are not apparent with the [cygwin](cygwin(3)) environment. However, the shell
  window is good for kicking off command line utilities (such as _make_) or
  any command line processes that generates output on _stdout_ as all of the
  output is captured in the buffer window which can be scrolled backwards
  for post analysis. For this very reason it is more preferable to a
  standard MS-DOS box.

  It is not possible to run any utilities that use embedded screen control
  characters as these are not interpreted by the editor.


## Changing the Shell 


  The default shell that is executed is defined by the environment variable
  __$COMSPEC__. Where the user is using a different command shell (i.e. 4-DOS),
  then problems may arise if this is an old 16-bit executable. The shell
  that MicroEmacs executes may be overridden by setting the environment
  variable __$ME_ISHELL__. This is typically set in the [me32.ini(8)](me32.ini(8)) file i.e.

      [username]
      ME_ISHELL=c:\windows\command.com


## Bugs 


  __WinOldAp__
 
  >  __Winoldap__ is created by the Microsoft environment whenever a shell is
     created. On occasions where processes have terminated badly the user
     may be prompted to kill these off; this is the normal behaviour of
     Windows. It is strongly advised that the shell is always exited
     correctly (i.e. `exit`) before leaving the editor. The Windows operating
     system for '95/'98 is not particularly resilient to erroneous
     processes and can bring the whole system down. NT/2K/XP do not appear
     to suffer from these problems (so much).

  __Locked Input__
  
  >  There are occasions after killing a process the editor appears to lock
     up. This is typically a case that the old application has not shut
     down correctly. Kill off the erroneous task (`Alt-Ctrl-Del` - _End Task_)
     then bring the editor under control using a few `C-g` [abort-command(2)](abort-command(2))
     sequences.


## NOTES


  The __ishell__ command uses the [ipipe-shell-command(2)](ipipe-shell-command(2)) to manage the pipe
  between the editor and the shell. The window is controlled by the macro
  file `hkipipe.emf` which controls the interaction with the shell.

## NAME


  diff - Difference files or directories  
  diff-changes - Find the differences from a previous edit session  
  rdiff - Recursively compare files or directories  
  %diff-com - Diff command line
$a


## SYNOPSIS


|diff
  __diff__ "_old-version_" "_new-version_"
|diff-changes
  __diff-changes__
|rdiff
  __rdiff__ "_old-version_" "_new-version_"
|%diff-com
  `%diff-com` "_string_"; Default is "`diff`"


## DESCRIPTION


  __diff__ executes the __diff(1)__ command with the command line set by the
  [%diff-com(5)](%diff-com(5)) variable and the user supplied old-version and new-version.
  The output of the command is piped into the __*diff*__ buffer and is hilighted
  to show the changes (GNU diff only).

  Your version of __diff(1)__ will determine whether it is possible to
  difference directories.

  __diff-changes__ is a simple macro that differences the current buffer and the
  last backup of the associated file. It is a quick way to determine what
  has been modified recently. This macro only works if a backup file exists.

  __rdiff__ operates in the same way as __diff__ except it launches the __diff(1)__
  command with an extra _-r_ option which enables recursive compare (i.e.
  compares the contents of sub-directories as well). Your version of __diff__
  must support this option for __rdiff__ to operate correctly.

  __%diff-com__ is the command line that is used to execute a __diff(1)__ system
  command.

  For GNU diff then the following command line setting is recommended:-

       diff --context --minimal --ignore-space-change \
              --report-identical-files --recursive


  which should be defined in your personal user configuration. This is the
  default for Linux.


## NOTES


  __diff__, __diff-changes__ and __rdiff__ are macros defined in `tools.emf`.

  __diff(1)__ must be executable on the system before diff or diff-changes can
  function.

  __diff(1)__ is a standard utility on UNIX systems. For Windows 95/NT a version
  of GNU __diff__ may be found at:

  >  _<ftp.winsite.com/ftp/pub/pc/winnt/misc/gnudiff.zip>_

  For MS-DOS users, a DJGPP port of __diff__ is also available on the net. A
  commercial version of __diff__ is also available from MKS.

## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __osd-dialog__ "_title_" "_prompt_" [ "_x-pos_" "_y-pos_" ] "_but1_"  
  _n_ __osd-xdialog__ "_title_" "_prompt_" _default_ [ "_x-pos_" "_y-pos_" ]

      [ [ "entry-xsize" | "entry-xsizexentry-ysize" ] [ "type" ] ]  


## DESCRIPTION


  __osd-dialog__ constructs a OSD dialog prompt with a title string _title_, a
  prompt string within the dialog of _prompt_. A single button, with text
  rendering _but1_, is placed within the dialog. The dialog remains on the
  screen until the button is selected or the user aborts.

  __osd-xdialog__ creates an extended dialog with multiple buttons similar to
  __osd-dialog__, the number of buttons created (_#_) is determined from the
  number of _but_ arguments. The _default_ integer argument specifies the
  default button (1.._#_), a value of 0 specifies that there is no default
  button.

  The commands return the button pressed in the variable [$result(5)]($result(5)).

  __osd-entry__ constructs a simple OSD entry dialog which prompts the user to
  type in a value. The value of the supplied variable is used as an initial
  entry value, the variable is set to the entered value when the user
  presses the "`Okay`" button but remains unchanged if the user Cancel or
  aborts.

  The size of the entry defaults to 30 characters if not specified by the
  user, when a size parameter is given it can take one of two forms, either
  simply "`w`" specifying the width, the height defaulting to 1, or "`w`__x__`h`"
  (i.e. "`40x5`") specifying both. The last optional argument _type_ sets the
  type of value being entered (e.g. file name, buffer name, etc) see flag __h__
  on the help page for [@ml(4)](@ml(4)) for a list of entry types and the numerical
  value to be supplied.

  The argument _n_ can be used to change the default behavior of the commands
  described above, _n_ is a bit based flag where:-

  __0x01__
  
  >  Enables command abort (default), except __osd-entry__ which ignores the
     setting of this bit. When enabled, if the user abort by either closing
     the dialog (top right button) or using the __abort-command__ the dialog
     command will also abort. If bit 0x01 is not set the command will not
     abort and __$result__ will be set to -1.

  __0x02__
  
  >  When set, flags that a dialog position has also been provided, extra
     arguments __x-pos__ and __y-pos__ must also be given. By default the dialog is
     placed under the mouse.


## EXAMPLE


  A simple query dialog is typically constructed using __osd-dialog__, as
  follows:-

```{.emf}
        !if &seq %osd-search-str ""
            osd-dialog "Replace" "Error: Search string is empty!" "  &OK  "
            !return
        !endif

```

  The following example uses multiple buttons within a single dialog, using
  __osd-xdialog__, as follows:-

```{.emf}
        0 define-macro osd-close
            !if &bmod "edit"
                set-variable #l0 &spr "Buffer \"%s\" changed" $buffer-bname
                osd-xdialog "Buffer Close" #l0 1 "&Save First" \
                                                "&Loose Changes" "&Cancel"
                !if &equ $result 3
                    !abort
                !elif &equ $result 2
                    -1 buffer-mode "edit"
                !else
                    !if &seq $buffer-fname ""
                        !nma write-buffer
                    !else
                        !nma save-buffer
                    !endif
                !endif
            !endif
            delete-buffer $buffer-bname @mna
        !emacro

```

  The next example macro can be used to change the value of a user variable
  to a user supplied file name:

```{.emf}
        set-variable %source-root "~/"

        define-macro set-source-root
            osd-entry "Source Root" "&Path : " %source-root 35 1
        !emacro

```

  __osd-dialog__, __osd-xdialog__ and __osd-entry__ are macros defined in `osd.emf`, using
  [osd(2)](osd(2)) to create the dialog.

## SYNOPSIS


   _n_ __auto-spell__  
  __auto-spell-buffer__  
  __auto-spell-reset__  
  _n_ __auto-spell-ignore__


## DESCRIPTION


  __auto-spell__ enables and disables the auto spell checking of the current
  buffer. Auto spell detects word breaks as you type and checks the spelling
  of every completed word hilighting any erroneous words in the error color
  scheme (usually red).

  The argument _n_ determines whether auto-spell is enabled or disabled, a
  positive argument enables and a negative argument disables. If no argument
  or _0_ is supplied the auto-spell state is toggled.

  __auto-spell-menu__ opens the auto-spell context menu which lists suggested
  corrections for the current word and other useful auto-spell commands and
  configuration options. This menu can also be accessed via the main mouse
  context menu when the current buffer has auto spell enabled.

  __auto-spell-buffer__ checks all words within the current buffer for spell,
  hilighting any unknown or miss-spelled words found.

  __auto-spell-reset__ resets the buffer hilighting scheme, removing any added
  erroneous words.

  __auto-spell-ignore__ gets the current word and deletes the erroneous
  hilighting and adds the word to the current temporary ignore dictionary,
  auto-spell and the spelling-checker will now ignore the word. If an
  argument __n__ of 2 is given to the command the word is added to the users
  personal dictionary instead of the temporary ignore dictionary so the word
  is 'ignored' in all future sessions of MicroEmacs as well.

## NAME


|find-zfile
  find-zfile - Compressed file support
|auto-spell-reset
  zfile-setup - Compressed file support setup
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __find-zfile__ "_file-name_"  
  __zfile-setup__ "_extension_" "_list-command_" "_cut-to_"  
     "_column_" "_file-end_" "_extract-command_"  
     "_remove-command_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __find-zfile__ provides generic support for listing and extracting the
  contents of compressed files. __find-zfile__ also supports the extraction of
  the internal files into another buffer.

  __find-zfile__ must be configured for each compression format using
  __zfile-setup__. It relies on command-line programs to generate content lists
  which are used to generate the main file listing, and subsequently, the
  ability to extract individual files for file extraction support.

  For basic content listing support the first 3 arguments must be given to
  zfile-setup. The first argument "_extension_" is used as the compressed file
  id string. The compressed file type is derived from the file extension,
  e.g. "`zip`" or "`Z`" for UNIX compressed files. The exact case of the
  extension is checked first, followed by the lower case and upper case
  string.

  The compressed file contents list is generated from executing the user
  supplied "_list-command_" and dumping the output into the list buffer. The
  command is run from the directory containing the compressed file and the
  following special tags may be used within the "_list-command_" which get
  substituted as follows:-

  __%zb__
  
  >  The token is replaced with the compressed files base name, i.e. the
     file name without the path.

  __%zf__
  
  >  The token is replaced with the compressed files absolute file name,
     i.e. the file complete with the path.

  The head of the list output is often unwanted verbose printout, this can
  be automatically be removed by the use of the "_cut-to_" argument. The
  argument, if supplied (not an empty string), must be a [regex](RegularExpressions(2)) search string
  matching the start of the required list. If found, all text before it is
  removed.

  For single file extraction support the last 4 arguments must be specified
  by __zfile-setup__. The file to extract is selected either by selecting the
  file name using the left mouse button or by moving the cursor to the line
  containing the file name and pressing the "`return`" key.

  __find-zfile__ assumes that the file name starts at a fixed column number,
  specified with the "_column_" argument. The end of the file name is obtained
  by searching for the regular expression "_file-end_" string, the file name
  is assumed to end at the start of the search string match.

  The file is then extracted by executing the supplied "_extract-command_" and
  then loading the extracted file into a new buffer. The command is run from
  the system temporary directory (i.e. "`/tmp/`" on UNIX or `$TEMP` on Windows
  etc.). The following special tags may be used within the "_extract-command_"
  which get substituted as follows:-

  __%zb__
  
  >  The token is replaced with the compressed files base name, i.e. the
     file name without the path.

  __%zf__
  
  >  The token is replaced with the compressed files absolute file name,
     i.e. the file name complete with the path.

  __%fb__
  
  >  The name of the file to be extracted.

  The file is assumed to be extracted to the temp directory due to the way
  the command is run, this file is then loaded into a new buffer. The
  temporary file should then be removed using the supplied "_remove-command_"
  with is run from the temp directory, the "__%fb__" special tag may be used in
  the command. This argument may be given as an empty string, thereby
  disabling the removal.


## EXAMPLE


  For zip file support the freely available __unzip(1)__ command can be used,
  following is the list of arguments with suitable entries:

     extension           zip
     list-command        unzip -v %zb
     cut-to              ^ Length
     column              58
     file-end            $
     extract-command     unzip -o %zf %fb
     remove-command      rm %fb


  For the zip file "_/usr/jasspa/memacros.zip_", after substitution the list
  command becomes "`unzip -v memacros.zip`" which will be executed in the
  "_/usr/jasspa/_" directory. This will produce the following form of output:

     Archive:  memacros.zip
         Length  Method   Size  Ratio   Date    Time   CRC-32     Name

  The top Archive line is not require, this is automatically removed by
  setting the "_cut-to_" to "`^ Length`" which matches the start of the next
  line.

  For file extract, consider the file "`ctags.emf`", the first character '`c`'
  is at column 58 and the first character after the end of the file name is
  the end-of-line character ('`\n`') which is matched by the [regex](RegularExpressions(2)) string "$",
  hence the settings on "_column_" and "_file-end_". When this and the zip file
  name are substituted into the extract-command, it becomes "unzip -o
  /usr/jasspa/memacros.zip calc.emf" and is run from the "_/tmp._" directory.
  Note that the "`-o`" option disables any overwrite prompts, these are not
  required as tests and prompting have already been performed by __find-zfile__.
  The extracted file "_/tmp/calc.emf_" is then loaded into a new buffer. 

  The temporary file is removed by executing the substituted remove-command
  which becomes "`rm calc.emf`" from the "`/tmp/`" directory.

  For gzipped tar files, extension "__tgz__" the following setup can be used on
  UNIX platforms:

     extension           tgz
     list-command        unzip -v %zb
     cut-to
     column              43
     file-end            $
     extract-command     gunzip -c %zf | tar xof - %fb
     remove-command      rm %fb


  For the tgz file "_/usr/jasspa/memacros.tgz_", this will produce the
  following listing:

     tgz file: /usr/jasspa/memacros.tgz

  __charset-utf8-to-iso__  
  


## DESCRIPTION


  __charset-change__ opens a dialog allowing the user to select a __From__ and __To__
  character set. If the _Convert_ button is selected the current buffer is
  converted to the destination character set. The command assumes that the
  current buffer is written in the __From__ character set, no attempt is made to
  verify this.

  __charset-iso-to-user__ converts the current buffer, assumed to be in
  ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) font format, to the current user's character set
  (defined by [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3))). This process typically corrects any foreign
  language display problems.

  Conversely, __charset-user-to-iso__ converts the current buffer from the
  user's character set to ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1), this is typically used for
  the transfer of text files between different systems.

  The utf8 conversion functions can be used to convert UTF-8 characters to the 
  ISO or Windows encoding selected currently in [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)). 
  The UTF-8 characters can't be displayed by MicroEmacs - so they should be converted 
  usually using these  functions. 
  To  convert  your  current  opened  file  into the  current  character set from
  UTF-8  Unicode  you use  the  function  __charset-utf8-to-iso__.  In case of
  trouble  you might get an empty  buffer, you should  then reload the current
  file without saving it.
  
  If you your file mainly has non-Unicode characters you might just ignore the few 
  Unicode characters. The function __charset-iso-to-utf8__ is usually used at the end to export
  a file back into the UTF-8 encoding.

  The current character set is configured using the [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) dialog
  (see [Display Font Set](user-setup(3))). This in turn uses the command [set-char-mask(2)](set-char-mask(2)) to
  create the low level character conversion tables.


## NOTES


  __charset-change__, __charset-iso-to-user__,  __charset-user-to-iso__, __charset-utf8-to-iso__ and
  __charset-iso-to-utf8__ are macros defined in `charsutl.emf`. The UTF-8 conversions require the command
  line tool __iconv(1)__. If this is not installed the user will get a warning in the message line.

! 3 execute-tool
## NAME


  execute-tool - Execute a user defined shell tool
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __execute-tool__ "_tool-name_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __execute-tool__ launches a predefined shell tool, the tools are typically
  defined by the [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) Tools page and executed using the MicroEmacs
  main Tools menu. See help on [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) for more information on the
  basic facilities given by execute-tool.

  If the numeric argument _n_ is supplied it is used as the tool name to be
  executed, otherwise the argument "_tool-name_" must be given.

  A tool with a numeric name can be executed via a key binding, for example,
  to execute tool __3__ (as defined by __user-setup__) to '`C-3`' add the following
  line to the user setup file:-

```{.emf}
        3 global-bind-key execute-tool "C-3"

```

## NOTES


  The registry entries for a tool must be located in registry directory
  "`/history/`__$platform____/tool/____tool-name__" where __$platform__ is the current setting
  of variable [$platform(5)]($platform(5)) and __tool-name__ is the name of the tool as given to
  the command. The following registry entries are used:-

  __name__
  
  >  The name of the tool as displayed in the user-setup Tools dialog and
     the Main Tools menu. This is only used for tools `0` to `9`.

  __command__
  
  >  The command-line to be launched when the tool is executed, the
     following special tokens may be used in the command-line which are
     substituted at execution:-

  >  __%ff__
            The current buffer's full file name, including the path.

  >  __%fp__
            The current buffer's file path.

  >  __%fn__
            The current buffer's file name without the path.

  >  __%fb__
            The current buffer's file base name, i.e. the file name without
            the path or the extension.

  >  __%fe__
            The current buffer's file extension with the '.' (e.g. ".emf"),
            set to the empty string if the file name does not have an
            extension.

  >  Note that "__%ff__" is always the same as "__%fp%fn__" and "__%fp%fb%fe__". If any
     of these tokens are used, the tool will fail to execute if the current
     buffer does not have a file name.

  __flag__
  
  >  A bit based flag setting the tool characteristics, where:-

  >  __0x01__ 
            Enable current buffer saving.

  >  __0x02__
            Enable prompt before saving current buffer.

  >  __0x04__ 
            Enable all edited buffers saving.

  >  __0x08__
            Enable prompt before saving an edited buffer.

  >  __0x10__
            Enable output capturing.

  >  __0x20__
            Enable concurrent running, not available on all platforms, see
            variable [$system(5)]($system(5)).

  __bname__
  
  >  The name of the buffer to be used if the output is captured. The
     following special tokens may be used in the buffer name which are
     substituted at execution:-

  >  __%fn__
  
  > >   The current buffer's file name without the path, set to the buffer
        name if the current buffer does not have a file name.

  >  __%fb__

  > >   The current buffer's file base name, i.e. the file name without
        the path or the extension. Set to the buffer name if the current
        buffer does not have a file name.

  >  __%fe__
  
  > >   The current buffer's file extension with the '.' (e.g. ".emf"),
        set to the empty string if the current buffer does not have a file
        name or it does not have an extension.
  
  >  Note that "__%fn__" is always the same as "__%fb%fe__". Default buffer name
     when this field is left empty is "_*command*_", or "_*icommand*_" if Run
     Concurrently is enabled.

  If more than 10 tools are required (maximum number definable by
  __user-setup__) or names are preferred, it is recommended that the __user-setup__
  dialog is used to define the tool and then use the registry copy utility
  bound to '`c`' in a [list-registry(2)](list-registry(2)) buffer.

## SYNOPSIS


  __info__

  __info-on__ _topic-str_

  __info-goto-link__ _link-str_

  __$INFOPATH__ _string_

  __.info.path__ _string_


## DESCRIPTION


  __info__ interprets the GNU _info_ pages, and presents the info file information
  within a buffer window called `*info XXXXX`, where `XXXXX` is the name of the
  info file. The root of the info page is displayed and may be traversed by
  selecting the links with the mouse, or by using the standard _info_
  traversal keys.

  The root of the _info_ tree is, by default, a file called __dir__, which points
  to the other information sources. The default search paths for the _info_
  directories are:-

      `c:/info` - MS-DOS and MS-Windows (all).
      `/usr/local/info` - All UNIX platforms.

  The root directory may also be specified with the `$INFOPATH` environment
  variable. This is a colon (`:`) or semi-colon (`;`) separated list of
  directory paths which specify the locations of the info files, for UNIX
  and Microsoft DOS/Windows environment's, respectively.

  __info-on__ gets info on a user specified top level topic, e.g. "`gcc`", the
  info file "_topic-str_`.info`" must be found in the info search path.

  __info-goto-link__ gets and displays info on a user specified link or subject.
  The link may be within the currently displayed topic (the _link-str_ need
  only specify the subject node name) or a subject within another topic (in
  which case the _link-str_ takes the following form "(_topic_) _subject_").


## NOTES


  __info__ is a macro implemented in file `info.emf`.

  When an __info__ command is run for the first time, the info search path is
  constructed and stored locally in the command variable __.info.path__. This
  variable must be directly changed by the user if changes to the info
  search path are required.

## NAME


  gdiff - Graphical file difference  
  %gdiff-com - Gdiff diff(1) command line
$a


## SYNOPSIS


|gdiff
  __gdiff__ "_version1_" "_version2_"
|%gdiff-com
  `%gdiff-com` "_string_"; Default is "`diff -c -w`"


## DESCRIPTION


  __gdiff__ is a macro utility that facilitates the merging of two files
  (typically with different modification revisions). The changes between the
  revisions are hilighted with color, allowing modification regions and
  lines to be selected for the generation of a newer revision file, which
  might encompass selected modifications from each of the base revisions.

  __gdiff__ executes the __diff(1)__ command with the command line set by the
  [%gdiff-com(5)](%gdiff-com(5)) variable and the user supplied version1 and version2. The
  output is displayed in two buffer windows, side by side, and the
  differences in the lines are hilighted to show the changes. In addition
  the content of the two buffers is _normalized_ such that both windows are
  aligned at the same line position, allowing the changes in the text to be
  viewed in both windows at the same time. 

  Whilst in __gdiff__ view mode then both scroll bars (if visible) are _locked_,
  such that either scrolls BOTH windows at the same time. Other key commands
  are disabled, as are the menu interactions. The short cut keys are defined
  as follows:-

  `esc h/A-h` - View the help page.
  
  >  Invokes the display of a OSD help box, summarizing the interaction
     commands

  `C-up` - Move to previous difference
  
  >  Moves to the previous changed region above the current cursor
     position.

  `C-down` - Move to next difference
  
  >  Moves to the next changed region below the current cursor position.

  `left mouse button`  
  `space`  
  `enter`  
  `r` - Select difference version
 
  >  Selects the difference version of the currently selected window. The
     region is hilighted as the required region to be incorporated into the
     new revision.

  `R` - Select neither version.
  
  >  Marks both regions as not required.

  `l` - Line select current version
  
  >  Selects the current line from the region as being included, without
     including ALL of the region modifications.

  `L` - Line select neither version
  
  >  Discards lines from both revisions of the file.

  `g` - Globally selects the current version.
  
  >  Shortcut allows ALL modifications to the current side to be accepted.
     This is typically the fastest method to select all changes, minor
     region adjustment may then be performed on those regions which are
     inappropriately included by the selection.

  `G` - Globally selects neither version.
  
  >  Marks all regions as not being acceptable.

  `C-x C-s` - Save current side
  
  >  Saves the current window to the specified file, merging the selected
     changes between the two revisions. Note that the save only operates
     iff all hilighted changes have been selected.

  `C-x C-w` - Save current side as
  
  >  Same as __Save current side__ except the user is prompted to enter a new
     filename to which the modifications are written.

  `C-x k` - Exit graphical diff
  
  >  Exits the __gdiff__ utility.


## Hilighting 


  The hilighting within the windows is dependent upon the color scheme
  selected, in general the following hilights apply:-

  normal text
  
  >  No change

  cyan/grey
  
  >  Addition/removal of line(s)/region(s) between files.

  yellow
  
  >  Modification in line(s)/region(s).

  green/red

  >  Selected region, red or green is attributed to a selection for each
     window.


## NOTES


  __gdiff__ is a macro defined in `gdiff.emf`, inspired by the GNU utility of the
  same name __gdiff(1)__

  __diff(1)__ must be executable on the system before __gdiff__ can function. The
  __diff(1)__ invocation must include the _context_ difference, which annotates
  the differences with a `+`, `-` or `!` markers. __diff(1)__ is typically invoked
  with the options __-c -w__.

  __diff(1)__ is a standard utility on UNIX systems. For Windows 95/NT a version
  of GNU __diff__ may be found at:

  >  _<ftp.winsite.com/ftp/pub/pc/winnt/misc/gnudiff.zip>_

  For MS-DOS users, a DJGPP port of GNU __diff__ is also available on the net. A
  commercial version of __diff__ is also available from MKS.

## NAME


|expand-iso-accents
  expand-iso-accents - Expand an ISO accent
|iso-accents-mode
  iso-accents-mode - Enable/disable ISO accent expansion short-cut mode
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __expand-iso-accents__  
  _n_ __iso-accents-mode__


## DESCRIPTION


  __expand-iso-accents__ provides a facility to enter a plain text
  representation of an ISO accent and then to expand it into a proper ISO
  accented character. For example:-

     ``a` => small a, grave accent
     `^a` => small a, circumflex accent
     `'a` => small a, acute accent
     `"a` => small a, umlaut
     `~a` => small a, tilde
     `.a` => small a, ring
     `14` => fraction, one-quater
     `12` => fraction, one-half
     `34` => fraction, three-quaters
     `ae` => ae ligature
     `sz` => small sz ligature, German.
     `+-` => plus or minus (math.)
     `co` => copyright
     `rg` => registered trademark
     `tm` => trade mark
     `oe` => small oe ligature
     `/o` => small o, slash

  The __expand-iso-accents__ can be called directly to expands the ISO
  abbreviated character sequence into it's ISO ASCII character equivalent.
  The command looks at the 2 characters to the left of the cursor and tries
  to find a matching abbreviation, if found the 2 characters are removed,
  replaced by the single ISO character.

  The more typical way of using this feature is by enabling its use in the
  [abbreviation handler](expand-abbrev-handle(3)) which is usually bound to "esc esc ". It can be
  enabled by either by using the __iso-accents-mode__ command or, for a more
  permanent installation, from the [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) => General => Abbrev
  Expansion settings.

  When using the __iso-accents-mode__ command, if a numeric argument _n_ is given
  (the value is not used) then the ISO accent expansion is installed locally
  into the current buffer. If _n_ is omitted then expansion is
  enabled/disabled globally (across all buffers).

  __expand-iso-accents__ is the macro command that This is by default bound to .
  If an ISO character is not located then [expand-abbrev(2)](expand-abbrev(2)) is invoked to try
  a standard abbreviation.


## NOTES


  __iso-accents-mode__ and __expand-iso-accents__ are implemented as macros in the
  file `abbrev.emf`, the repertoire of expansions may be enhanced by editing
  this file.

  Unlike the general [expand-abbrev(2)](expand-abbrev(2)) command which attempts to expand the
  current word, __expand-iso-accents__ only considers the last two characters
  regardless of whether they are word characters or start a word. Therefore
  the general __expand-abbrev__ command cannot be used to implement a similar
  feature.

## DESCRIPTION


  __gdb__ and __dbx__ provide an editor interface to the GNU and native system
  debuggers, respectively. On running either command then an interactive
  shell window is opened to the debugger command line interface. MicroEmacs
  then interprets the information from the debugger interface and opens
  files and hilights the current line as required. The current line is
  maintained while single stepping through the code.

  Buffers opened and referenced by the debugger have the key `F9` bound to
  setting a break point.

  The input mode in the shell window may be toggled using key __f3__

## SYNOPSIS


  __expand-abbrev-handle__ (__esc esc__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __expand-abbrev-handle__ pulls together all forms of abbreviation expansion
  into a single command so that it can be bound to a single key. The
  abbreviation must be an alpha-numeric string and the cursor must be one
  position to the right of the abbreviation (which must not be
  alpha-numeric) when this command is called. The command attempts to expand
  the abbreviation using the following commands in turn:

  [expand-abbrev(2)](expand-abbrev(2))

  >  Uses a buffer specific and global abbreviation files, if set, to look
     up the abbreviation. The use of the abbreviation file can be disabled
     using [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)).

  [expand-look-back(3)](expand-look-back(3))

  >  Looks for a word starting the same in the current buffer's last 100
     lines, this can be enabled in the [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) General page.

  __Buffer specific expansion__

  >  Executes a buffer specific abbreviation expansion if the current
     buffer's [file hook](fileHooks(2)) supports abbreviation expansion.

  __Word expansion__

  >  If the current buffer does not support file type specific expansion
     and Word Expansion is enabled via the [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) General page
     (`Dict'n` setting) expansion is attempted using the [expand-word(3)](expand-word(3))
     command which expands the current partial word using the dictionary of
     the user's current language; warning - this can be slow!

  The command exits after first command to successfully expand or if none
  expand the command fails. See the help in the individual expansion
  commands for more help.

## SYNOPSIS


  __expand-word__


## DESCRIPTION


  __expand-word__ attempts to complete the word at the current position through
  the use of the current language dictionary. The user is presented with a
  list of endings for the given word portion. These may be selected with the
  cursor or mouse.

  __expand-word__ is automatically invoked from the [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3))
  macro in response to an expansion command, it is only invoked if enabled
  in the [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) => General => Abbrev Expansion => Dict'n setting is
  enabled.


## NOTES


  __expand-word__ is a macro implemented in `abbrev.emf`.

  The __user-setup__ configuration simply sets the macro variable
  `.expand-word.on` to TRUE, i.e.:

```{.emf}
        set-variable .expand-word.on 1

```

  It may be subsequently disabled by setting the variable back to 0.

! 3 ftp
## NAME


  ftp - Initiate an FTP connection
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __ftp__


## DESCRIPTION


  __ftp__ initiates a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) connection to a remote host
  on the network. Using FTP, editing of files may be performed in much the
  same way as on the local file system. Directory listings may be retrieved
  and traversed using the mouse or cursor keys. Using the directory listing,
  files may be transfered to/from the remote host to the local machine.

  On issuing the command then a dialog is presented to the user which is
  used to open the connection. The dialog entries are defined as follows:-

  __Registry File__
  
  >  The name of a MicroEmacs registry file which is used to store the FTP
     information. If a registry name is provided then all FTP address
     information is stored in the registry file and saved for later
     sessions. Be aware that password information is saved in this file as
     plain text if a password is entered into the site information.

  >  If the registry information is omitted then the information is not
     saved between sessions.

  __Site Name__
  
  >  An ASCII pseudo name for the remote host. The pull-down menu may be
     used to select existing sites that have been previously entered.

  __Host Address__
  
  >  The address of the host, this may be an IP address (`111.222.333.444`)
     or a DNS name (i.e. `ftp.mysite.com`).

  __User Name__
  
  >  The login name for the site. If this is omitted then [$user-name(5)]($user-name(5)) is
     used by default.

  __Password__
  
  >  The password used to enter the site for the given login name. If the
     password is NOT supplied then the user is prompted for the password
     when a transaction takes place. If the password is omitted and left to
     promt then it is not stored in the registry.

  >  Take note of the comments provided above regarding the password
     information.

  __Initial Host Path__
  
  >  The starting directory at the remote host. If this is omitted then the
     root directory ('`/`') is used by default.

  On selecting __Connect__ then a FTP connection is opened and the initial
  directory appears as a directory listing, if the initial path is a file
  then the file is loaded into the editor.

  Thereafter the file may be edited within the editor as normal, on a write
  operation then the file is written back to the host, via FTP.

  On opening a FTP connection the progress of the transfer, and the FTP
  commands issued, may be viewed in the `*ftp-console*` buffer. This buffer
  may automatically appear depending upon the value of the [%ftp-flags(5)](%ftp-flags(5))
  variable.


## NOTES


  __ftp__ is a macro implemented in `ftp.emf`. This uses the underlying command
  [find-file(2)](find-file(2)) to implement the FTP transfer.

  FTP files can be directly loaded and edited using the standard file
  commands such as [find-file(2)](find-file(2)).

  The FTP addresses are retained in a registry file (see [erf(8)](erf(8))). The
  registry file is automatically loaded when MicroEmacs starts up each
  session. The current site information may be viewed using [list-registry(2)](list-registry(2))
  and is located at the following registry addresses:-

  __/url__
  
  >  Data value is file system location of the FTP registry file.

  __/url/ftp/___<hostName>_
  
  >  The name of the host to which the connection is to be made.

  __/url/ftp/___<hostName>___/host__
  
  >  The name or IP address of the remote host

  __/url/ftp/___<hostName>___/user__
  
  >  The user name used to log into the remote host.

  __/url/ftp/___<hostName>___/pass__
  
  >  The user password to the remote host. If this entry is empty then the
     user is always prompted for the password when the connection is made.

  __/url/ftp/___<hostName>___/path__
  
  >  The initial path at the remote site.

  When a FTP connection is initiated then the connection (socket) remains
  open for a period of approximately 4 minutes from the last transfer time,
  after that the connection is automatically closed and is re-initiated if
  required again.

## BUGS


  Directory completion is not available when the current working directory
  is an FTP address. To work around this from the command line, select
  `<RETURN>` to get a directory listing of the current directory and select
  the file(s) from the directory to load.

! 3 display-whitespaces
! 3 display-white-chars
## NAME


  display-whitespaces - Toggle the displaying of white characters
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __display-whitespaces__


## DESCRIPTION


  __display-whitespaces__ toggles the displaying of white characters in the main
  display. By default white characters, space tab and new-lines, are
  represented with invisible characters such as one or more '` `'s for spaces
  and tabs and text moving to the next line for new-lines. The user can make
  this characters become 'visible' using this function.

  When this function is first called it toggle enables the displaying of
  these characters, other characters are drawn in their place to make them
  visible. A subsequent call will disable the displaying of them.


## NOTES


  __display-whitespaces__ is a macro implemented in `misc.emf` and uses bit
  `0x80000` of the [$system(5)]($system(5)) variable.

  The displaying of white characters can be enabled or disabled at start-up
  using [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)).

  This feature may be more confusing on some terminals due to the lack of
  characters available for displaying the white characters. The characters
  used when displaying white characters are defined in the variable
  [$window-chars(5)]($window-chars(5)).

  The macro __display-white-chars__ was renamed to __display-whitespaces__ in
  September 2006.

## NAME


  check-line-length - Check the length of text lines are valid
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __check-line-length__


## DESCRIPTION


  __check-line-length__ checks that the length of each line of the current
  buffer, starting with the current line, is less than or equal to
  [$buffer-fill-col(5)]($buffer-fill-col(5)). The command aborts if a line too long is found,
  leaving the cursor on the offending line. If no invalid lines are found
  the command succeeds leaving the cursor at the end of the buffer.


## NOTES


  __check-line-length__ is a macro implemented in `misc.emf`.

## NAME


  reread-file - Reload the current buffer's file
$a


## SYNOPSIS


|reread-file
  _n_ __reread-file__
|reread-all
  _n_ __reread-all__


## DESCRIPTION


  __reread-file__ reloads from disk the file associated with the current buffer,
  this command is particularly useful when the file is continually updated
  by an external program. If the buffer has been edited and its name does
  not start with a '`*`' then the user is prompted as to whether the changes
  should be discarded. Also if the buffer has an active process running in
  it then confirmation is sort from the user before the process is killed.

  The argument _n_ can be used to change the default behavior of reread-file
  described above, _n_ is a bit based flag where:-

  __0x01__
  
  >  Enables loss of work checks (default), if this flag is not supplied
     then the buffer is reread without any user prompts (useful in macros).

  __reread-all__ reloads all out-of-date buffers. If the argument _n_ is specified
  as zero (0) then all buffers are re-read. The default with no numeric
  argument is reload out-of-date buffers only.


## NOTES


  __reread-file__ is a macro implemented in `tool.emf`.

## NAME


  normal-tab - Insert a normal tab
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __normal-tab__


## DESCRIPTION


  __normal-tab__ insert a tab into the current buffer by temporarily disabling
  any auto indentation schemes. The macro first disables any indentation
  rules by setting [$buffer-indent(5)]($buffer-indent(5)) to 0 the command [tab(2)](tab(2)) is then called
  with the given argument _n_. This means that the buffer's [tab(2m)](tab(2m)) mode
  setting will be respected, i.e. whether a tab character or spaces are
  inserted. The initial indentation rules are restored on exit.


## NOTES


  __normal-tab__ is a macro implemented in `format.emf`.

## NAME


!  perldb - Perl Debugger
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __perldb__ [ "_script-name_" ] "_script-args_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __perldb__ provides an editor interface to the Perl debugger, on running the
  command an interactive shell window is opened to the debugger command line
  interface. MicroEmacs then interprets the information from the debugger
  interface and opens files and hilights the current line as required. The
  current line is maintained while single stepping through the script.

  Buffers opened and referenced by the debugger have the key `F9` bound to
  setting a break point, this only works if the buffer contains the current
  execution point.

  If an argument _n_ of 2 is given to __perldb__ the command assumes that the
  current buffer is the script file to debug, the "`script-name`" argument is
  not prompted for.


## NOTES


  __perldb__ is a macro defined in file `hkipipe.emf`.


## BUGS


  The '__R__' rerun command does not work correctly on Windows platforms, perldb
  is rerun in a newly created external dos command window instead of inside
  the MicroEmacs ipipe buffer.

! 3 generate-tags-file
## NAME


  generate-tags-file - Generate a tags file
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __generate-tags-file__ [ "_tag-command_" ]


## DESCRIPTION


  The __generate-tags-file__ command provides an interface to tag file
  generation. Typically the "_tag-command_" argument will not be required as
  the current buffer will automatically configure __generate-tags-file__ on how
  tags are generated for the current buffer's file type. See the notes below
  for more information on configuration.

  __generate-tags-file__ supports two different methods of tag generation,
  firstly via a MicroEmacs macro file and secondly by an external shell
  command (such as __ctags(1)__). It is generally configured in the current
  buffer's [setup hook](fileHooks(2)).

  If a macro file is used a setup dialog is opened if an argument of 0 is
  given to __generate-tags__. This dialog can be used to configure which type of
  tags are required and the starting directory (useful when using recursive
  tags over a source tree). Note that not all tag types are available for
  all file types.

  The generated tags file can then be used by the [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2)) command.


## NOTES


  __generate-tags-file__ is a macro defined in file `gentags.emf`.

  __generate-tags-file__ can be configured in one of 2 ways:

  >  When a MicroEmacs macro file (such as `ctags.emf`) is to be used, simply
     give the name of the macro file to be run as the "_tag-command_"
     argument. Alternatively set the variable __.___<$buffer-fhook>___.tags__ to this
     name, e.g. for C files

```{.emf}
                set-variable .fhook-c.tags "ctags"

```

  >  Note the "`.emf`" extension is assumed.

  >  When an external shell command is to be used, set the _tag-command_ to
     the shell command-line prefixed with a '`!`' character, for example to
     use __ctags(1)__ try the following:

```{.emf}
                set-variable .fhook-c.tags "!ctags *.c *h"

```

  >  Note that the generate-tags dialog is not available in this mode of
     execution.

## DESCRIPTION


  The cvs and sub-commands provide MicroEmacs with an interface to __cvs(1)__.
  __CVS__ is a version control system; using it, you can record the history of
  your source file modifications. CVS is licensed under the GNU General
  Public License and is freely available on the Internet, see the
  documentation provided with CVS for more information on its features and
  use.

  The MicroEmacs __cvs__ command opens up a modified [file-browser(3)](file-browser(3)) with an
  additional "`*cvs-console*`" window. The "`*files*`" window includes
  additional columns showing the CVS state, revision and repository date.
  The browser by default opens with 3 windows including a representation of
  the file tree. When __cvs__ is provided with a numeric argument _n_ of zero (0)
  then a single window displaying the directory is used only (i.e. __0 cvs__)

  The functionality of the file-browser is the same as a non-CVS folder with
  the exception that additional CVS item controls are located in the mouse
  context menu (opened by clicking the right mouse button in the `*files*`
  buffer). This menu item opens another sub-menu providing access to the
  items below. When selecting commands than a pop-up check-box may be
  displayed which allows options to be selected for the command.

  __Current State__
  
  >  Checks the state of selected file(s) or directory against the
     repository. Differences detected are shown in the `*cvs-state*` window.
     This provides a quick method of determining the working directory
     state.

  >  The `*cvs-state*` buffer supports some of the same features as a
     directory listing, the files can be loaded (using `return` or left click
     on the file name), selected (using space or left mouse button on the
     left hand edge) and CVS commands executed from the window operate
     either on the selected files or the listed files if no files are
     selected. This runs the command "`cvs -nq update <files>`".

  __Checkout files__
  
  >  Checks out a file or directory from the repository into the current
     directory. The file or directory is specified by typing the name into
     a dialog which is opened when this option is selected. This runs the
     command "`cvs checkout <file>`".

  __Update files__
  
  >  Updates the currently selected files, files are selected by clicking
     the left button to the left of the required file name. Multiple files
     may be selected by 'dragging' a hilight region over the required
     files. This runs the command "`cvs update <files>`".

  __Commit files__
  
  >  Commits any changes made to the selected files back to the CVS
     repository. This runs the command "`cvs commit <files>`". The user is
     prompted for the message to add on the commit.

  __Diff files__
  
  >  Displays any differences between the selected files and the CVS
     repository version in the _*cvs-console*_ window. This runs the command
     "`cvs diff <files>`".

  __Log files__
  
  >  Displays the CVS logs for the selected files in the _*cvs-console*_
     window. This runs the command "`cvs log <files>`".

  __Status files__
  
  >  Displays the CVS status for each of the selected files in the
     _*cvs-console*_ window. This runs the command "`cvs status -v <files>`".

  __Tag files__
  
  >  Adds, removes or moves a CVS tag on the selected file(s) or
     directories. A pop-up window is displayed which allows entry of the
     tag name and define the operation. This runs the command "cvs tag
     <files>".

  __Add files__
  
  >  Adds the selected files to the CVS repository. Note this command only
     performs the local add, a __CVS commit__ is required to make the addition
     permanent. This runs the command "`cvs add <files>`". A pop-up is
     displayed to allow the user to change the mode of the add to binary or
     text.

  __Remove files__
  
  >  This command is deliberately not implemented as its far to dangerous!
     Instead it opens a dialog informing the user to use the __cvs-remove__
     command instead.

  __Graphical diff__
  
  >  This command opens a [gdiff(3)](gdiff(3)) window showing the differences between
     the currently selected file and the CVS repository version. Note this
     command only works with a single file.

  __Resolve conflicts__
  
  >  This command may be used to resolve merge conflicts created by a _CVS_
     _update_ operation. The command opens a [gdiff(3)](gdiff(3)) window showing the
     areas of conflict allowing the user to select the correct version and
     saving the resultant version back to the local file. Note this command
     only works with a single file.

  __Clear cvs console__
  
  >  Clears the _*cvs-console*_ buffer.

  The __cvs-add__ command adds the current buffers file to the repository. Note
  that this command only performs the local addition, a _CVS_ _commit_ is
  required to make the addition permanent.

  The __cvs-checkout__ command checks out a file or directory from the
  repository into the current directory. The user specifies the file on the
  message line.

  The __cvs-commit__ command commits any changes made to the currently buffer's
  file (including additions) to the repository. The user is prompted for a
  commit log message.

  The __cvs-diff__ command opens a _*cvs-diff*_ window displaying the differences
  between the current buffer's local file and repository version. If the
  current buffer is a directory list it will list all the differences found
  in all files within the directory.

  The __cvs-gdiff__ command opens a [gdiff(3)](gdiff(3)) window displaying the differences
  between the current buffer's local file and repository version.

  The __cvs-log__ command opens a _*cvs-log*_ window displaying the CVS log of the
  current buffer's file.

  The __cvs-remove__ command removes the current buffer's file from the
  repository - PLEASE NOTE THIS CAN LEAD TO LOST DATA!!! This command only
  performs the local removal; as it deletes the buffer and file the
  __cvs-commit__ command cannot be used to commit the removal to the CVS
  repository. Instead the main __cvs__ file-browser menu or __cvs(1)__ itself must
  be used.

  The __cvs-resolve-conflicts__ command may be used to resolve any conflicts
  created by CVS when the current buffer's file is updated. The command
  opens a gdiff window displaying the areas of conflict, the user may then
  select the correct version in each case and save the resultant new version
  over the local file.

  The __cvs-state__ command opens a _*cvs-state*_ window listing the state of any
  file in the current directory which is not up-to-date. Note that unlike
  most cvs sub commands this command executes over all files in the current
  buffer's file directory.

  The __cvs-status__ command opens a _*cvs-state*_ window and shows the state of
  the current buffer in the window including the modification state,
  repository etc.

  The __cvs-tag__ command opens a dialog box and allows the user to add, remove
  or delete a CVS tag.

  The __cvs-update__ command updates all files in the current directory, the
  output being reported to a new _*cvs-update*_ window. Note that unlike most
  cvs sub commands this command executes over all files in the current
  buffer's file directory.


## Setup 


  __cvs-setup__ provides a dialog interface to configure the MicroEmacs CVS
  interface if required. On a typical system installation then it is
  sufficient to have __$CVSROOT__ defined in the environment and the CVS tools
  will operate from this environment variable without any further
  configuration of MicroEmacs. If MicroEmacs CVS configuration is provided
  then this will over-ride the environment variable.

  __cvs-setup__ may also be accessed from [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) from the __Miscellaneous__
  configuration. The the dialog provides the following configuration
  controls:

  __CVS Command Setup__

  >  `CVSROOT`
  
  > >  If set, overrides the CVS $CVSROOT environment variable.

  >  `CVS_RSH`
  
  > >  If set, overrides the CVS $CVS_RSH environment variable. rsh.

  >  `CVS Command`
  
  > >  Defines the cvs(1) system command. The default when not defined is
       cvs.

  >  `Compression`
  
  > >  Sets the compression level to use with all CVS commands.

  >  `Quieter CVS output`
  
  > >   When enabled the -q CVS command-line option is used to suppress
        some of the more verbose print-out.


## CVS File Browser 


  The __CVS File Browser__ is an extension to the [file-browser(3)](file-browser(3)) and shows the
  state of CVS files in a directory listing.

  `Quick browser mode`
  
  >  When enabled the CVS file browser does not launch a cvs command to
     determine the current state of all files in the directory, instead it
     extracts as much information as it can from the local file system,
     inserting '`Q`'s for information it cannot determine. This is useful
     when the connection to the server is slow. The full CVS information
     can be obtained by executing the command __cvs-full-reread__, typically
     bound to `C-f5`.

  __Tool Defaults__
  
  >  The following define the default settings for options used in various
     CVS commands:

  > >  `Recurse into sub-directories`

  > >  `Check-out missing directories`

  > >  `Prune empty directories`


## NOTES


  __cvs__ and sub-commands are macros defined in file `cvs.emf`.

  When filtering is enabled in the file browser the filter used by the CVS
  interface depends on the file browser mode, if __Quick browser mode__ is
  enabled the same filter is used, but when disabled all files ignored by
  __cvs(1)__ are also removed by the filter. Use [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)) in the buffer
  to enable/disable the filter.

## NAME

  occur - list of occurences for a buffer
$a

## SYNOPSIS


  __occur__


## DESCRIPTION


  __occur__ performs a regular expression search for a string in the current
  buffer; generating a list of every occurrence of the regular expression in
  the buffer.

  On invocation the user is prompted for a [Regular Expressions](RegularExpressions(2)) the buffer is
  searched for the expression and the results are presented in the
  `*item-list*` window appearing at the left-hand side of the window.

  The user may interact with the `*item-list*` buffer using the mouse or
  `<RETURN>`, on selecting a line then the user is moved to the corresponding
  line in the original buffer.


## NOTES


  The `*item-list*` window may be closed with the command [item-list-close(3)](item-list-close(3))
  typically bound to `esc-F7`.

  __occur__ is a macro defined in `itemlist.emf`.

$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __item-list__ (__F7__)  
  __item-list-find__  
  __item-list-close__ (__esc F7__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __item-list__ performs a regular expression search of a buffer, presenting a
  list of the located text and associated types in a separate window which
  is presented to the left of the buffer window. __item-list__ is a generic
  function that interacts with the buffer environment variables to present
  abbreviated buffer information to the user.

  The regular expression search strings are predefined in the language
  templates. To add support for a new buffer type a list of search/replace
  strings must be created. The search strings must use regex (magic mode)
  and groups `\(..\)` to place the located object string into the replace
  string. Within the template buffer search strings (__s__) and replace (__r__) are
  defined with the following syntax:-

      set-variable ._hookname_.item-list-s_x_ "_regexp_"
      set-variable ._hookname_.item-list-r_x_ "_replace_"

  Where:-

  _hookname_
  
  >  The name of the file hook i.e. `fhook-c` for ANSI 'C'.

  _x_
  
  >  The search number, this is valid in the range 1..9, commencing from 1.
     The search is processed in the order of the numeric identity.

  _regexp_
  
  >  The regular expression to search for. One of the arguments must
     include a groups `\(..\)` definition to allow the string to be moved to
     the replace.

  _replace_
  
  >  The replace string, this typically includes a _type_ and part of the
     search string.

  On invocation of __item-list__ the buffer is searched and the results are
  presented in the `*item-list*` window appearing at the left-hand side of the
  window. If there is no item list set up for the file type then an error
  message is displayed.

  The user may interact with the `*item-list*` buffer using the mouse or
  `<RETURN>`, on selecting a line then the user is moved to the corresponding
  line in the original buffer.

  __item-list-find__ finds the current item list item and searches for the text
  in the original buffer. This is typically bound to a mouse or key stroke
  action.

  __item-list-close__ closes the item list buffer.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example works through the __item-list__ definition for the ME
  macros e.g. given that the ME macro definition is:

      define-macro macro-name


  Searching for "`define-macro \([a-z-]+\)`" and replacing with "`Macro \1`"
  will work most of the time. The space between `define-macro` and the name
  does not have to be a single space and the _name_ does not have to contain
  just lower case letters, so these search strings should be a flexible as
  possible, try

      "define-macro\s +\(\w+\)"


  This however is not as optimal as it could be and if you have large files
  this could become slow. Performance can be greatly increased if it can be
  anchored to the start of the line, e.g.

      "^define-macro\s +\(\w+\)"


  but to allow for initial white spaces and the optional numeric argument,
  you really need

      "^\s *[0-9]*\s *define-macro\s +\(\w+\)"


  To hilight the function name you need the name encased the name in a magic
  hilighting string,

      "\ecBmacro-name\ecA"


  where `\e` is an escape char, so the replace string should be

      "Macro \ecB\1\ecA"


  Now all thats needed is to set these variables as fhook command variables,
  for macro files, the file hook command is `fhook-emf`, therefore the
  following is required:

```{.emf}
        set-variable .fhook-emf.item-list-s1 "^\\s *[0-9]*\\s *define-macro\\s +\\(\\w+\\)"
        set-variable .fhook-emf.item-list-r1 "Macro \ecB\\1\ecA"

```

  Note that you can have as many of these search and replace variables as
  you require, i.e. `.item-list-s1`, `.item-list-s2`, `.item-list-s3`, ... ; but
  the more you have the slower it will be, often a good regex can do the job
  of 2 or 3.

  __comment-end__


## DESCRIPTION


  The action of the __comment__ commands are file type specific (comments in __C__
  are `/* ... to ... */` where as MicroEmacs macro file comments are ; ... to
  the end of line) so the commands must be configured for each file type
  (see the NOTES section below). The configuration is automatically
  performed by almost all the standard file hooks released with MicroEmacs
  by the file hook so these commands should be fully functional.

  __comment-line__ comments out the current and next _n_-1 lines (default when _n_
  is omitted is to comment out just the current line). The cursor is then
  moved to the start of the next line. __uncomment-line__ behaves differently
  depending on whether the file type terminates a comment with an end token
  or simply by the end of the line. If an end token is used then
  __uncomment-line__ removes the current and next _n_ comments. If the end of line
  is used __uncomment-line__ removes the first comment on the current and next
  _n-1_ lines.

  __comment-to-end-of-line__ inserts _comment-pad_s (see NOTES) up-to the
  [$buffer-fill-col(5)]($buffer-fill-col(5)) and then terminates the comment with the comment-end
  string. __comment-restyle__ reformats the text within the comment, filling
  text lines to the __$buffer-fill-col__ and regenerating any boxing and divide
  lines.

  __comment-start__ opens a new "__*comment*__" buffer which is configured for
  writing a text comment, the user can then type in the comment with all the
  benefits of MicroEmacs in a plain text editor. Once the comment is
  complete use the __comment-end__ command to insert the comment into the source
  file, this comment is locally bounded to "__C-c C-c__". The styling of the
  comment is controlled by the _comment-flag_ setting (see NOTES).


## NOTES


  Consider the structure of a box comment to be as follows:

      <comment-start><comment-pad><comment-pad><comment-pad><comment-box-right>
      <comment-box-left> COMMENT TEXT ... COMMENT TEXT      <comment-box-right>
      <comment-box-left> COMMENT TEXT ... COMMENT TEXT      <comment-box-right>
      <comment-box-left><comment-pad><comment-pad><comment-pad><comment-end>


  The comment commands are configured by the single file hook command
  variable __.fhook-___<type>___.comment__ where _<type>_ is the file type label. The
  structure of the variable is a [list](&ldel(4)) with the following format:

            |<comment-start>|<comment-end>|<comment-pad>|<comment-box-left>|...
                ...<comment-box-right>|<comment-flags>|


  Where `|` is the list divide character. The _<comment-flags>_ are a list of
  character flags which are defined as follows:

  `b`
  
  >  Box format required, i.e. create right edge using _<comment-box-right>_.

  `f`
  
  >  Footer line required.

  `F`
  
  >  Fill footer line with _<comment-pad>_ strings.

  `h`
  
  >  Header line required.

  `H`
  
  >  Fill header line with _<comment-pad>_ strings.

  `j`
  
  >  Enable Justify mode in *comment* buffer.

  `r`
  
  >  A restyle key binding is added to the buffer "`esc o`" and "`esc q`"
     buffer key bindings are added and bound to [comment-restyle(3)](comment-restyle(3)).


## EXAMPLE


  The following __comment__ is the standard __C__ setting:

```{.emf}
        set-variable .fhook-c.comment "|/*| */|*| * | * |f|"

```

  This can be used to create comments of the form:

         /* comment-line comments out the current and next n-1 lines (default
         * when n is omitted is to comment out just the current line). The
         * cursor is then moved to the start of the next line.
         *
         * uncomment-line behaves differently depending on whether the file
         * type terminates a comment with an end token or simply by the end
         * of the line.
         */


  A box style comment can be generated by changing the _<comment-flags>_ form
  `f` to `bfFhH`, producing:

        /*********************************************************************
         * comment-line comments out the current and next n-1 lines (default *
         * when n is omitted is to comment out just the current line). The   *
         * cursor is then moved to the start of the next line.               *
         *                                                                   *
         * uncomment-line behaves differently depending on whether the file  *
         * type terminates a comment with an end token or simply by the end  *
         * of the line.                                                      *

! 3 display-matching-fence
## NAME


  display-matching-fence - Display the matching bracket
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __display-matching-fence__


## DESCRIPTION


  __display-matching-fence__ draws the fence (or bracket) pairing the one the
  cursor is currently over. A fence is considered to be one of the
  following:

      {...}   (...)   [...]


  If the matching fence is currently being drawn (i.e. it is visible) both
  fences are drawn in the '_Normal_' Matching Fence scheme (see
  [scheme-editor(3)](scheme-editor(3))). If the matching fence is not currently visible the
  cursor is temporarily moved to the matching fence for [$pause-time(5)]($pause-time(5))
  milliseconds before returning to the starting position, the fences are
  hilighted using the Matching Fence 'Current' scheme. The matching fence
  delay can be interrupted by pressing any key. If the fence cannot be
  matched the fence is hilighted using the 'Select' scheme which is usually
  a bold red color.

  The numeric argument __n__ passed to the command is a bitwise flag where each
  bit is defined as follows:

  __0x01__
  
  >  Display fence (if not set nothing is done).

  __0x02__
  
  >  Use set-position id '`\x85`' instead of '`\x84`' (for internal use).

  __0x04__
  
  >  Don't Jump when matching fence is off screen.

  __0x08__
  
  >  Jump when closing a fence and its pair is off screen (for internal
     use).

  __0x10__
  
  >  Always jump to matching fence when closing a fence (for internal use).

  __0x20__
  
  >  Give preference to closing fence to left of cursor rather than
     character under the cursor (for internal use).


## NOTES


  This macro is used by the __Fence Display__ setting of [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)), the
  macro is bound to the `idle-pick` event using some of the more obscure
  numeric argument flags.

! 3 expand-look-back
## NAME


  expand-look-back - Complete a word by looking back for a similar word
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __expand-look-back__


## DESCRIPTION


  __expand-look-back__ attempts to complete the word at the current position by
  looking backward for another word which starts the same. If such a word is
  found within 100 lines of the current cursor position the current partial
  word is replaced with the word found.

  __expand-look-back__ is automatically invoked from the [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3))
  macro in response to an expansion command, it is only invoked if enabled
  in the [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) => General => Abbrev Expansion => Lookbk setting is
  enabled.


## NOTES


  __expand-look-back__ is a macro implemented in `abbrev.emf`.

  The __user-setup__ configuration simply sets the macro variable
  `.expand-look-back.on` to TRUE, i.e.:

```{.emf}
        set-variable .expand-look-back.on 1

```

  It may be subsequently disabled by setting the variable back to 0.

  space-rectangle - Adds space(s) vertically.
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __string-rectangle__ "_string_"  
  _n_ __space-rectangle__


## DESCRIPTION


  __string-rectangle__ inserts the _string_ at the same column position on each
  line of the current region. The command prompts the user for a string and
  inserts it at the current cursor column on all the lines between the
  cursor and the mark inclusive. This is generally used to pre-pend lines
  with new text.

  __space-rectangle__ is the same as __string-rectangle__ except it inserts _n_
  spaces, default being 1, rather than a given _string_. This command is very
  useful when moving a column of text over to align with another column.

## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __buffer-init__ _name_ [_etf_]  
  __buffer-init-hooks__  
  __buffer-init-fhook__ _name_


## DESCRIPTION


  The __buff-init__ commands prepare the operating modes of a buffer for a
  language template. These commands operate with variables defined in the
  template and automatically configure MicroEmacs to use the template.

  The commands are used in the hook files (hkXXX.emf - see [File Hooks](fileHooks(2))) and
  simply the setting up of [File Language Templates](languageTemplates(2)) by automating common
  actions and integrating the configuration settings made via
  [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)).

  The hook file is declared from `me.emf` or the user start up file binding a
  file extension or magic string association with the hook file. i.e.

```{.emf}
            -1 add-file-hook "-[*!]-[ \t]*XXX.*-[*!]-"    fhook-XXX
             1 add-file-hook "^#!/.*XXX"                  fhook-XXX

```

  On loading a file which matches the [add-file-hook(2)](add-file-hook(2)) definition then the
  `hkXXX.emf` file is executed and the template is applied to the file.

  A basic template framework to be used with the __buff-init__ commands may be
  defined as follows for a language template called _XXX_:-

```{.emf}
        ; File hook - initialize buffer on loading the file.
        define-macro fhook-XXX
            set-variable $buffer-mask "luh1"
            @# buffer-init "XXX"
            buffer-init-hooks

```

  __buffer-init__ is invoked from the buffer file hook [fhook](fileHooks(2)) and is invoked with
  the numerical argument passed to the _fhook_ macro (specified as `$#`). The
  call takes two arguments, the first is the _name_ of the template or hook,
  in the example this is _XXX_. The second argument is the _etf_ template name
  (see [etf(8)](etf(8))). The command initializes the buffer, using the _.fhook-XXX_
  variable information defined in the file.

  __buffer-init-hooks__ is invoked from the buffer file hook [fhook](fileHooks(2)) typically
  following the __buffer-init__ call this macro invokes any user defined file
  hooks of the form __my-fhook-XXX__. User defined __my-bhook-XXX__ and __my-ehook-XXX__
  are configured into the buffer space ready for execution.

  __buffer-init-hooks__ must be placed in all __fhook-XXX__ macros to correctly
  initialize the file hooks. If this is not added then the "`my-*hook-always`"
  macros may not be called correctly for buffers where the __fhook-XXX__ has not
  been configured correctly.

  __buffer-init-fhook__ is placed at the end of the hook file definition and
  retrieves additional configuration information from the registry and the
  user settings, it will also locate and load any user additions to the
  template by loading the file `myXXX.emf`.

  A set of global default file hooks may be defined of the form
  __my-fhook-always__, __my-bhook-always__, __my-ehook-always__ and __my-dhook-always__.
  These file hooks are global and invoked after the


## Execution Sequence 


  It is important to understand the execution sequence of the buffer hook
  files. On identifying a new file hook then the `hkXXX.emf` file is fetched
  from the file system and executed. Execution causes all of the variables
  to be defined and finally, when all definitions have been made,
  __buffer-init-fhook__ is executed to load in any user defined extensions. At
  this point then the macro __fhook-XXX__ has ONLY been defined it has NOT been
  executed. This load operation is performed once only and is on demand.

  The __fhook-XXX__ macro must be defined BEFORE any of the variables associated
  with the hook as all subsequent variables are command variables and are
  defined in the context of the macro definition. See [Variables(4)](Variables(4)) for more
  information on macro variables.

  __fhook-XXX__ is invoked to apply hilighting, buffer key bindings, indentation
  etc. to a new buffer which has just been created.

  __ehook-XXX__ is invoked when a buffer is swapped out. This may be used to
  save global variables that have been modified in the context of the
  buffer.

  __bhook-XXX__ is invoked when a buffer is swapped in. This may be used to
  restore variables that are specific to a buffer to global variables.

  __dhook-XXX__ is invoked before a buffer is deleted. This may be used to clean
  up a buffer before it is destroyed.

  __Extended file hooks__
  The buffer hooks `[fbed]hook-XXX` may be extended by user specific
  configuration in the form `my-[fbed]hook-any`, these are invoked after the
  primary hook as been invoked and operate on all buffers rather than a
  specific buffer type. The _my-*hook-always_ mechanism is provided by the
  _buffer-init_ macros of `buffinit.emf` rather than from the base command set
  of MicroEmacs.


## Configuration Masks 


  Buffer initialization is controlled by the settings of the variables
  __.fhook-XXX.setup__ and __fhook-XXX.setup-mask__:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable .fhook-XXX.setup &reg "/history/fhook/XXX" "bdfghnopx"
        set-variable .fhook-XXX.setup-mask "abdefghikmnoptux"

```

  The variables use an ASCII configuration string that identifies the modes
  of operation that are required. Upper and lower case alternatives are
  presented, an uppercase flag disables the mode, lower case enables. Where
  the flag is not specified then the mode is not changed.

  `a` - Auto mode
  
  >  Configure [auto(2m)](auto(2m)) mode for automatic source file line type detection.
     Typically enabled for text files.

  `b` - Abbreviation mode
  
  >  Configures the abbreviation mode using [buffer-abbrev-file(2)](buffer-abbrev-file(2)) for the
     buffer.

  `c` - View / Author mode
  
  >  Configure [view(2m)](view(2m)) mode for read only or authoring.

  `d` - Auto indentation operation.
  
  >  Automatic indent is enabled using [indent(2)](indent(2)).

  >  Where [indent(2m)](indent(2m)) mode is required then omit the `d` flag and use flag `i`
     instead.

  `e` - Exact or case sensitivity operation
  
  >  Configure [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) case sensitive mode. `e` enable exact, `E` disable
     exact.

  `f` - Folding/Collapsing operation
  
  >  Configures folding support, if enabled then the variables
     _.fhook-XXX.collapse-OPERATION_, should be defined to declare the
     folding points.

  `g` - Fence matching operation
  
  >  Configure fence matching mode with [fence(2m)](fence(2m)). Note that fence matching
     is now typically performed in the macro environment using
     [display-matching-fence(3)](display-matching-fence(3)) rather than the in-built fence matching.
     This colorizes the fences that are matched. `g` enable fence matching, `G`
     disable fence matching.

  `h` - Hilighting
  
  >  Support syntax hilighting, when defined then the hilighting scheme
     defined by _.hilight.XXX_ is attached to the buffer.

  `i` - Automatic indentation
  
  >  Support indentation using [indent(2m)](indent(2m)). Automatic indentation (see
     [indent(2)](indent(2))) is defined with the d flag. i enables indent, I disables
     indent.

  `j` - Justify
  
  >  Configure paragraph justification using [justify(2m)](justify(2m)). `j` enable justify,
     `J` disable justify.

  `k` - Backup mode
  
  >  Configure backups with [backup(2m)](backup(2m)) mode. `k` enable backup, `K` disable
     backup.

  `m` - Magic mode
  
  >  Configure regular expression [magic(2m)](magic(2m)) mode. `m` enable magic, `M` disable
     magic.

  `n` - New buffer header
  
  >  Enable the insertion of a buffer header from the [etf(8)](etf(8)) template file.

  `o` - Tool menu
  
  >  Enable the tool menu for the buffer.

  `p` - Help page
  
  >  Produce a help page for the buffer describing the bindings.

  `s` - Auto spell
  
  >  Configure automatic spelling for the buffer using [auto-spell(3)](auto-spell(3)).

  `t` - Tab mode
  
  >  Configure insertion of literal tabs by enabling [tab(2m)](tab(2m)) mode. `t` enable
     tab, `T` disable tab.

  `u` - Undo
  
  >  Configure the undo/redo history using [undo(2m)](undo(2m)) mode. `u` enable undo, `U`
     disable undo.

  `w` - Wrap
  
  >  Configure wrapping using [wrap(2m)](wrap(2m)) mode. `w` enable wrap, `W` disable wrap.

  `x` - Time stamping
  
  >  Configure time stamping as defined by [time(2m)](time(2m)).

  `1` - Reformatting hilighting
  
  >  A special internal flag indicating that hilighting is used for
     reformatting purposes, i.e. to make readable and hide control text.

  `#` - Commenting
  
  >  Special flag used to indicate commenting is supported. The comment
     format should be defined with the _.fhook-XXX.comment_ variable within
     the template.

  __.fhook-XXX.setup__ is the current set-up, this is normally defined to take
  settings from the registry providing a default when not defined. This is
  the only mask that is allowed to include the uppercase flags. All values
  defined in __.fhook-XXX.setup__ are explicitly enabled or disabled by default.
  The setup set should contain the configuration flags that are required to
  make the template operate correctly, but should not include modes that the
  user may set up i.e. _exact_ or _magic_ etc.

  __.fhook-XXX.setup-mask__ defines the set of flags that are allowed with the
  template. The configuration defined in [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)) is tested against
  the mask, if the mask allows it then the mode is enabled. __.fhook-XXX.setup__
  is generally a subset of __.fhook-XXX.setup-mask__.

  [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)) operates with the values defined by .fhook-XXX.setup and
  __.fhook-XXX.setup-mask__. The initialization of __.fhook-XXX.setup__ is performed
  using the registry as follows:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable .fhook-XXX.setup &reg "/history/fhook/XXX" "bdfghnopx"

```

  This allows the user to configure over-ridding modes via [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)).
  The user configuration is saved to the [Registry](Registry) and restored using
  [&reg(4)](&reg(4)), when the variable is defined. The flags that are defined by
  [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)) include a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, m, n, o, p, s, t,
  `u`, `w`, and `x`.


## Tags 


  The buffer setup may be configured to add a tags generator to the language
  template, this is added to the menu. The tags generation is declared in
  the template by assigning the variable __.fhook-XXX.tags__ with a command line
  to run tags utility. The command line string should commence with a `!`
  character to tell MicroEmacs to execute an external command, for example
  to use the GNU __ctags(2)__ utility is defined as:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable .fhook-c.tags "!ctags *.c *.h"

```

  When the value starts with a '`!`' then rest of the line is spawned as a
  process, no additional interface is provided to the command.

  Some language templates include a macro _tags_ facility to generate a tags
  file (See [emftags(3f)](emftags(3f)) - `emftags.emf`, [ctags(3f)](ctags(3f)) - `ctags.emf`, [ntags(3f)](ntags(3f)) -
  `ntags.emf`). __.fhook-XXX.tags__ may be defined to use an internal macro based
  tags generator rather than an external command. Without the '`!`' character
  the command line is assumed to be an MicroEmacs macro based and runs the
  command

       me @<.tags-var-value> -v%tag-options=<options>


  A macros based command line for the 'C' Programming Language is defined
  as:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable .fhook-c.tags "ctags"

```

  The presence of a tags generator is not flagged in the setup flags,
  declaration of the __.fhook-XXX.tags__ variable is sufficient to declare that
  a tags generator exists.


## Private Configuration Extensions 


  The __.fhook-XXX.setup__ may be extended to include local configuration items
  that are private to a specific buffer. The extensions are added to the
  [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)) menu and provide an on/off check-box control to enable and
  disable specific buffer features. Feature examples include: Enable or
  disable Doxygen highlighting in a buffer, control hidden file names in a
  directory listing etc.

  The configuration extensions are defined using two additional hook
  variables, these variables are normally omitted and only defined if the
  extensions are required.

  __.fhook-XXX.setup-flags__
  
  >  Defines the alphabetic [`a-z`] setup characters that are used to enable
     or disable a feature. These are defined as MicroEmacs list variables
     (see [&lfind(4)](&lfind(4)), [&lget(4)](&lget(4)), etc. for the full syntax definition). The
     characters that may be used are those that are not used by buffer
     setup i.e. "`clqrvyz`"

  __.fhook-XXX.setup-labels__
  
  >  Defines the text labels that are added to the setup menu, the label is
     associated with the enable button.

  To add a new feature switch then the the character flags to hold the state
  are are defined with the __.fhook-XXX.setup-flags__ and
  __.fhook-XXX.setup-labels__. The characters defined with the __setup-flags__
  should be added to __.fhook-XXX.setup-mask__. If the option is to be enabled
  by default then the enabling character is added to __.fhook-XXX.setup__.

  To enable/disable the features then [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)) when invoked modifies
  the state of the variable __.fhook-XXX.setup__ and then executes the buffer
  hook again causing the new state to be processed and applied. The modified
  __.fhook-XXX.setup__ value is stored in the user registry and is applied
  thereafter when the specified buffer type is loaded.

  Within the template definition then the additional flags are checked by
  testing the state of the __.fhook-XXX.setup__ variable. An example is shown
  below.

```{.emf}
        ; Add the extra variable to the buffer-init variables
        ; Option 1 is disabled and Option 2 is enabled by default here.
        set-variable .fhook-XXX.setup &reg "/history/fhook/XXX" "bdfghnopxl"
        set-variable .fhook-XXX.setup-mask "abdefghikmnoptuxcl"

        ; Define the additional options.
        set-variable .fhook-XXX.setup-flags   "|c|l|"
        set-variable .fhook-XXX.setup-labels  "|Option 1|Option 2|"

        ; Test for the Option 1 being enabled.
        !if &sin "c" .fhook-XXX.setup
            ; Do Option 1 configuration.
        !endif

        ; Test for the Option 2 being enabled.
        !if &sin "l" .fhook-XXX.setup
            ; Do Option 2 configuration.
        !endif

```

  The templates `hkc.emf`, `hkcpp.emf` and `hkjava.emf` include private extensions
  which may be used as examples.


## Comments 


  The format of comments may be defined in the template using the
  __.fhook-XXX.comment__ variable. Definition of the comment form allows the
  comment formatting to be automatically set up. Where the comment format is
  defined then the following key bindings are automatically added to the
  template:-

  >  `C-c C-s` __comment-start__ - start a new comment.  
     `C-c C-c` __comment-line__ - comment out the current line.  
     `C-c C-d` __uncomment-line__ - remove commenting from current line.  
     `C-c C-e` __comment-to-end-of-line__ - comment to end of line.  
     `C-c C-r` __comment-restyle__ - format/re-style comment.  

  Help information is automatically added to the buffer to describe the key
  bindings if help information is enabled.

  The default comment format is defined with the variable __.fhook-XXX.comment__
  with an argument string in the form "__|__ _<comment-start>_ __|__ _<comment-end>_ __|__
  _<comment-pad>_ __|__ _<mid-box-left>_ __|__ _<mid-box-right>_ __|__ _<comment-flags>_ __|__".
  Where a language supports multiple comment types, or styles, then
  additional comment styles may be specified with a comment definition of
  the form __.fhook-XXX.comment-N__ where __N__ is an integer from `1` to `n`. Each
  definition defines an different comment style. Additional comment
  definitions should be ordered such that the longest or most definitive
  comment definition appears before other comment definitions which have
  less definitive features. The comment matching searches each of the
  comment definitions in the order `1` to `n` to determine the comment style, as
  soon as a positive match is located then the comment is used without
  searching the remaining comments.

  The fields of the comment definition are defined as follows:-

  _<comment-start>_
  
  >  The format of the start of the comment or comment open syntax.

  _<comment-end>_
  
  >  The format of the closing comment, where the comment exists to the end
     of the line then the field is defined as empty. Leading white space
     should be included where this affects the horizontal positioning of
     the comment, white leading space is ignored in any match i.e. "` */`"
     for C type comments.

  _<comment-pad>_
  
  >  The character to use to pad a comment between the _<comment-start>_ and
     _<comment-end>_ characters when creating a line or a box formation.

  _<mid-box-left>_
  
  >  The start of a comment continuation line when creating a box comment.

  _<mid-box-right>_
  
  >  The end of a comment continuation line when creating a box comment and
     the comment is not closed and continues on the next line.

  _<comment-flags>_
 
  >  The comment flags define how the comment should be formatted when
     re-styled. The flags are defined as single characters that describe
     the attributes. Re-styling may include the following attributes:-

  >  __b __  
            Box format required, create a left and right edge for the comment.

  >  __f __  
            A footer line is required, a new line is created following the
            comment text to contain the with a closing comment <comment-end>
            string. The end of comment is not padded.

  >  __F __  
            As f except the footer line is left padded with <comment-pad>
            strings.

  >  __h __  
            A header line is required, a new line is created before the
            comment text to contain the opening comment <comment-start>
            string. The end of comment is not padded.

  >  __H __  
            As h except the header line is right padded with <comment-pad>
            strings.

  >  __j __  
            Enable justification mode in the *comment* buffer and re-style.

  >  __r __  
            A restyle key binding is added to the buffer "esc o" and "esc q"
            buffer key bindings are added and bound to [comment-restyle(3)](comment-restyle(3)). The
            r flag is only processed from the

  Examples of the comments format are shown below.

  __'C' Programming language __
  
  Format: `/* ... */`

```{.emf}
            set-variable .fhook-c.comment "|/*| */|*| * | * |f|"

```

  The comment output is defined as:-

            /***************************************************************
             * This is a box comment                                       *
             ***************************************************************/

            /* Comment to end of line **************************************/


  __C++ Programming language __
 
  Format: `// ... <EOL>`

```{.emf}
            set-variable .fhook-cpp.comment "|//||/|// | //||"

```

  The comment output is defined as:-

            /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
            // This is a box comment                                       //

  C++ supports both C and C++ comment styles, both styles may be defined
  in the language template. For C++ then `//` is assumed to be the default
  style.

## Commands and Key Bindings 


  Local buffer commands and key bindings for over-riding key definitions
  used within the buffer are defined with the `fhook-XXX.command-*` variables.
  These are defined as MicroEmacs list variables (see [&lfind(4)](&lfind(4)), [&lget(4)](&lget(4)),
  etc. for the full syntax definition) and define a list of keys, commands
  and bindings. Each command is typically separated by the '`|`' character.
  The field order in all of the `fhook-XXX.command-*` variables MUST be
  consistent, so if a command is defined in field 5, then all definitions
  associated with that command MUST be defined in field 5 for all variables.

  To make the command definitions easier then the syntax `fhook-XXX.command-n`
  may be used where _n_ is an integer from _0..n-1_. The `fhook-XXX.command-n`
  statements are used to construct the `fhook-XXX.command-*` lists, the
  advantage being that the command and key bindings etc. are defined
  together. Once the `command-n` variables are processed then they are deleted
  from the environment. The general syntax of the `command-n` variable is
  defined as a list:

      `|command-flag|command-nbind|command-name|command-kbind|command-desc|`

  The command variables are defined as follows:-

  _.fhook-c.command-flag_
  
  >  A configuration flag that defines the components to use for the
     command. The flags are set as individual characters and are defined as
     follows:-

  >  `t` - Toolbar
  
  > >  Show the command in the toolbar. The .fhook-XXX.command-desc
       variable should contain a readable name for the command to display
       in the menu. An optional hot key for selection in any [osd](osd(2)) is
       specified by prefixing the character in the string with \H.

  >  `h` - Help Screen
   
  > >  Show the command in the help screen. The .fhook-XXX.command-desc
       variable should contain a readable name for the command to display
       in the menu. An optional hot key for selection in any [osd](osd(2)) is
       specified by prefixing the character in the string with \H.

  >  `b` - Key binding

  > >  Create a buffer key binding for the command, the key to bind is
       defined by the variable fhook-XXX.command-kbind, if the command
       requires a numerical argument then this is defined in the variable
       fhook-XXX.command-nbind. The binding is only created if the key
       buffer binding does not already exist, the binding may be forced
       by using the o flag. Where a key binding is only to be created if
       hilighting is enabled then the b flag should be qualified with the
       H flag.

  >  `o` - Forced key binding

  > >  Optionally used with the b and forces the binding to over-write
       any existing binding.

  >  `i` - Emulated key binding
   
  > >  Used with the b flag, ignores key bindings that are emulation
       mappings.

  >  `H` - Hilighting key binding
   
  > >  Used with the b flag, only performs the key binding if hilighting
       is enabled.

  _.fhook-XXX.command-name_
  
  >  Specifies the name of the command to execute, this may be a built in
     command of a macro. Typically the command is a local macro defined in
     the hook file.

  _.fhook-XXX.command-nbind_
  
  >  The value of the numeric argument to pass to the command defined in
     the _.fhook-XXX.command-name_ field. This field may be empty if no
     numeric argument is required.

  _.fhook-XXX.command-kbind_
  
  >  The local key binding to bind to the command, this field is only
     interpreted if the `b` is specified, otherwise the field may be empty.
     Where multiple key bindings are required to the same command then a
     field definition is required for each binding.

  _.fhook-c.command-desc_
  
  >  A short description of the command that is used for the help page (`h`)
     and toolbar (`t`). The field may be empty if the field is not specified
     for insertion into the toolbar or help page.

  As an example, two new commands or bindings may be defined for a template,
  the first field is bound to key `A-q` which executes macro `XXX-comp` with a
  numerical argument of 2. The second field binds a new key to
  [comment-restyle(3)](comment-restyle(3)).

```{.emf}
        .....

        set-variable .fhook-XXX.command-flag  "|th|bo|"
        set-variable .fhook-XXX.command-name  "|XXX-comp|comment-restyle|"
        set-variable .fhook-XXX.command-nbind "|2||"
        set-variable .fhook-XXX.command-kbind "|A-q|esc o|"
        set-variable .fhook-XXX.command-desc  "|Complete command||"

        .....

        ; Local macro definition to perform command completion
        define-macro XXX-comp
            set-variable #l1 @#
            .....
        !emacro

```

  The alternative form of definition using the `command-n` syntax is defined
  as:-

```{.emf}
        .....

        set-variable .fhook-XXX.command-0 "|th|2|XXX-comp|A-q|Complete command|"
        set-variable .fhook-XXX.command-1 "|bo||comment-restyle|esc o||"

        .....

        ; Local macro definition to perform command completion
        define-macro XXX-comp
            set-variable #l1 @#
            .....
        !emacro

```

  The key bindings sometimes need to be protected where they have been
  redefined to perform some other operation for example when emulation modes
  are used (i.e. __nedit__, __me3.8__). The buffer initialisation uses the command
  __buffer-bind-create__ and the variables __.buffer-bind-create.map-from__ and
  __.buffer-bind-create.map-to__ which define replacement keys for bindings. As
  an example the __nedit__ emulation mode uses key binding `C-c C-c` and provides
  a buffer binding mapping to translate any key buffer binding to a
  different key. i.e.

```{.emf}
        ; reconfigure the buffer bindings
        set-variable .buffer-bind-key.map-from "|C-c C-c|C-c C-d|"
        set-variable .buffer-bind-key.map-to   "|C-b|C-u|"

```

## Information Hiding with Collapse 


  MicroEmacs 2009 provides a generic, albeit coarse, folding mechanism which
  is applied to some of the well known file modes. The folding mechanism
  allows parts of the buffer to be scrolled up and hidden, leaving a residue
  hilighting marker within the buffer indicating a folded region. A folded
  buffer typically allows a summary of the buffer contents to be viewed
  within several windows, hiding the detail of the buffer.

  Note: __collapse__ was called __fold__ in earlier releases but the name was
  changed when real fold editing support was added, see `fold.emf` for more
  information.

  The folding mechanism uses well defined _start_ and _end_ markers which form
  part of the syntax of the well known file mode. i.e. in 'C' this is the
  open and closed braces that appear on the left-hand margin (`{` .. `}`). The
  intention is that the natural syntax of the text is used to determine the
  fold positions, requiring no additional text formating or special text
  tags to be inserted by the user.

  The language template defines the syntax of blocks of information that may
  be collapsed and hidden with [narrow](narrow-buffer(2)). In order to utilize the
  [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) and [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)) commands within a buffer, the
  _start_ and _end_ markers have to be initialized for the syntactical contents
  of the buffer. The buffer specific variables are defined as follows, where
  _XXX_ is the file hook base name. The `.fhook-XXX.collapse-*` variables define
  the regular expression search pattern and line positioning.

  __.fhook-XXX-collapse-open__
  
  >  A regular expression search string used to locate the start of the
     string. For speed the search string should include a regular
     expression start or end of line character whenever possible. i.e. in C
     the open is defined as "`^{`".

  __.fhook-XXX-collapse-close__
  
  >  A regular expression search string used to locate the end of the
     string. For speed the search string should include a regular
     expression start or end line character whenever possible. i.e. in C
     the close is defined as "`^}`".

  __.fhook-XXX-collapse-mopen__
  
  >  An integer value that denotes the number of lines to move in a forward
     or (negative n) backward direction from the _start_ line located by the
     search string to the position in the buffer to be folded. If default
     value when __mopen__ is omitted is 0, starting the fold from the search
     string line.

  __.fhook-XXX-collapse-mclose__
  
  >  The relative displacement from the close fold line to the fold
     position, this is a positive or negative displacement depending on
     where the fold is to be positioned.

  __.fhook-XXX-collapse-mnext__
  
  >  Specifies the number of lines to advance before the next search is
     continued on the fold operation. This is only used by [collapse-all](collapse-current(3)).

  The following examples show how the collapse variables are set up in each
  of the buffer modes.

  __C and C++__
  
  >  __C__ and __C++__ collapse on the open and close brace appearing in the
     left-hand margin. The collapse variables are defined in `hkc`/`hkcpp.emf`
     as follows:-

```{.emf}
            set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-open  "^{"
            set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-close "^}"
            set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-mopen  "-1"
            set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-mclose "1"
            set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-mnext "-1"

```
     Given a 'C' function definition:-

            static void
            myfunc (int a, int b)
            {
                /* Function body */
            }


     the folded version appears as follows:-

            static void
            myfunc (int a, int b) ... }



  __emf__
  
  >  MicroEmacs macro files __emf__ support folding of macro definitions, the
     collapse variables are defined in `hkemf.emf` as follows:-

```{.emf}
            set-variable .fhook-emf.collapse-open  "^0? ?define-macro[ \t]"
            set-variable .fhook-emf.collapse-close "^!emacro"
            set-variable .fhook-emf.collapse-mclose "1"
            set-variable .fhook-emf.collapse-mnext "-1"

```

  > Given a macro definition:-

```{.emf}
            0 define-macro mymacro
            ; This is the body of the macro
            ; ... and some more ...
            !emacro

```

  > the collapsed version of the macro is defined as:-

```{.emf}
            0 define-macro mymacro ... !emacro

```

  __nroff__
  
  >  __nroff__ is configured for manual pages only and folds between `.SH` and
     `.SS` sections, the hook variables are defined as follows:-

```{.emf}
            set-variable .fhook-nroff.collapse-open  "^\.S[SH]"
            set-variable .fhook-nroff.collapse-close "^\.S[SH]\|\'"
            set-variable .fhook-nroff.collapse-mnext "-1"

```
  > Given an nroff block of text defined as:-

            .SH SYNOPSIS
            .\" Some text
            .\" Some more text
            .SH DESCRIPTION


  > Then the collapsed version appears as:

            .SH SYNOPSIS
            .SH DESCRIPTION


  __tcl/tk__
  
  >  __tcl/tk__ is configured to collapse procedures. The collapse variables
     are defined as:-

```{.emf}
            set-variable .fhook-tcl.collapse-open  "^proc "
            set-variable .fhook-tcl.collapse-close "^}"
            set-variable .fhook-tcl.collapse-mclose "1"
            set-variable .fhook-tcl.collapse-mnext "-1"

```

  > Given a tcl procedure definition:-

            proc tixControl:InitWidgetRec {w} {
                upvar #0 $w data

                tixChainMethod $w InitWidgetRec

                set data(varInited)   0
                set data(serial) 0
            }


  > The collapsed version of the same section appears as:-

            proc tixControl:InitWidgetRec {w} { ... }


  Where folding is required using [fold-open(3)](fold-open(3)) then the collapse methods
  above are not enacted when folding is enabled. Folding may be enabled as
  defined by the [File Hooks](fileHooks(2)), alternatively the folding may be explicitly
  defined using the variable _.fhook-XXX.fold_. The _.fhook-XXX.fold_ variable
  argument is defined as "__|__ _<literal-open>_ __|__ _<literal-close>_ __|__
  _<comment-termination>_ __|__ _<regex-find-open>_ __|__ _<regex-find-close>_ __|__." Where
  the fields are defined as follows:-

  _<literal-open>_
  
  >  The literal fold open string.

  _<literal-close>_
  
  >  The literal fold close string.

  _<comment-termination>_
  
  >  The comment termination string.

  _<regex-find-open>_
  
  >  The regular expression to find an open fold.

  _<regex-find-close>_
  
  >  The regular expression to find a close string.

  > As an example, a language may have the following syntax for defining
    folds:-

      /* {{{ This is an example fold. */
      This is
      the body
      of the fold
      /* }}} */


  > The fold is defined as follows:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable fhook-XXX.fold "|/\\* {{{|/\\* }}}|\\*/|/\\*[ \t]*{{{|/\\*[ \t]*}}}|"

```

## Item Lists 


  [Item Lists](item-list(3)) perform a regular expression search of a buffer, presenting a
  list of the located text and associated types in a separate window which
  is presented to the left of the buffer window or more typically in the
  toolbar. The command [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) is a generic command that interacts with
  the buffer environment variables to present abbreviated buffer information
  to the user.

  The regular expression search strings are predefined in the language
  templates, using the variables __.fhook-XXX-item-list-sY__ and
  __.fhook-XXX-item-list-rY__ and are described more fully in [item-list(3)](item-list(3)).


## Hilighting 


  Buffer hilighting is defined by the [hilight(2)](hilight(2)) command. Within the context
  of __buffer-init__ then the standard definitions and name space conventions
  should be adhered to:-

```{.emf}
        !if &not &exist .hilight.XXX

```

## Indentation 


  Buffer indentation is defined by the [indent(2)](indent(2)) command. Within the context
  of __buffer-init__ then the standard definitions and name space conventions
  should be adhered to. The buffer indentation scheme uses the hilighting
  variable, if hilighting is not defined then the variable allocation of
  `.hilight.XXX` should be performed as defined in the previous Hilighting
  section.

```{.emf}
        !if &sin "d" .fhook-XXX.setup
            0 indent  .hilight.XXX 0 10
            indent .hilight.XXX n "{"  4
            indent .hilight.XXX o "}" -4
            .....
        !endif

```

## HISTORY


  The January 2005 version of MicroEmacs introduced the following changes:

  - The `my-*hook-always` introduced allowing global file hooks to
        manipulate operate on any buffer.
  - The Electric-C indentation previously flagged as `>` was removed, as
        was cmode(2m). Indentation configuration for C mode is now performed
        by the [indent(2)](indent(2)) command.
  - Private template configuration using __.fhook-XXX.setup-flags__ and
        .fhook-XXX.setup-labels.
  - The `fhook-XXX.command-n` syntax was introduced in June 2005 to
        simplify the command list definitions.

## DESCRIPTION


  The __page-file__ commands allow large files, up to 2GB in size, to be viewed
  and edited. __page-file__ operates by loading a small part (or _page_) of the
  file into a buffer for viewing and editing hence the whole file is not
  loaded into memory. The file may be viewed and edited while in a page
  mode, MicroEmacs automatically manages the page swapping and updates to
  the file.

  While a file is being paged then a replacement set of commands are used to
  navigate through the buffer. These replacement commands automatically load
  the next page into the buffer, discarding or saving any edits from
  existing pages.


## File Loading 


  __page-file__ finds the named file _file-name_. If it is already in a buffer,
  make that buffer active in the current window, otherwise attempt to create
  a new paged buffer and read the file into it. Syntax hilighting is
  available following any file loading. __page-file__ is the paged equivalent of
  [find-file(2)](find-file(2)).

  The numeric argument _n_ is used to modify the default behavior of the
  command, where the bits are defined as follows:

  __0x01__
  
  >  If the file does not exist and this bit is not set the command fails
     at this point.

  __0x02__
  
  >  If this bit is set the file will be loaded with [binary(2m)](binary(2m)) mode
     enabled. See help on __binary__ mode for more information on editing
     binary data files.

  __page-bfile__ loads a file as binary data, providing binary editing
  capabilities. The command operate as command [page-file(3)](page-file(3)) except that it
  loads the given file with [binary(2m)](binary(2m)) mode set.


## Saving 


  __page-file-save-buffer__ saves the contents of the current buffer if the
  contents have been changed, writing the buffer back to the file it was
  read from. This command is the same as [save-buffer(2)](save-buffer(2)) for a paged file.


## Navigation 


  __page-file-beginning-of-buffer__ moves to the beginning of the buffer. If any
  edits have been performed at the current viewing position that need to be
  saved then the user is prompted to save the changes and the new pages are
  loaded from the file at the beginning of the buffer.

  __page-file-end-of-buffer__ moves to the end of the buffer in a similar way to
  __page-file-beginning-of-buffer__.

  __page-file-goto-byte__ advances the buffer to the byte offset specified by
  _byte-offset_. If any edits have been performed at the current viewing
  position that need to be saved then the user is prompted to save the
  changes and the new pages are loaded from the file at the specified file
  byte offset.

  __page-file-goto-page__ advances the buffer to the page offset specified by
  _byte-offset_. The behavior is the same as __page-file-goto-byte__.

  __page-file-scroll-up__ and __page-file-scroll-down__ moves the window in the
  current buffer down by _n_ lines, the default when _n_ is omitted is 1 windows
  worth of lines i.e. a next page operation. The user is prompted to save
  changes if a file paging operation is performed.

  __page-file-forward-line__ moves the cursor down _n_ lines, default 1. If the
  line is not on the current screen then display the next page and move to
  the line. Similarly __page-file-backward-line__ moves the cursor up _n_ lines,
  if the line is not on the current screen then display the previous page
  and move to the line. The user is prompted to save changes if a file
  paging operation is performed.


## Searching 


  __page-file-searching-buffer__ is designed to be called from a macro and
  searches for a string in the buffer. The _option_ specifies the search
  direction.

  __page-file-search-forward__ and __page-file-search-backward__ searches for a
  string from the current cursor position to the end/start of the file and
  is simular to [search-forward(2)](search-forward(2)) and [search-backward(2)](search-backward(2)), respectively. If
  the search string is not found in the current buffer then the search
  continues by paging the file until the start/end of the file is reached.
  The user is prompted to save changes if a file paging operation is
  performed.

  __page-file-isearch-forward__ and __page-file-isearch-backward__ perform and
  incremental forward and backward search in the paged file and are similar
  to [isearch-forward(2)](isearch-forward(2)) and [isearch-backward(2)](isearch-backward(2)), respectively. If the search
  string is not found in the current buffer then the search continues by
  paging the file until the start/end of the file is reached. The user is
  prompted to page and save changes if a file paging operation is performed.


## NOTES


  The __page-file__ macros are implemented in macro file `pagefile.emf`. The
  paging is managed in macro space and uses [insert-file(2)](insert-file(2)) to perform the
  read.

## NAME


|toolbar
  toolbar - Toggle tool bar visibility.
|toolbar-open
  toolbar-open - Open the tool bar.
|toolbar-close
  toolbar-close - Close the tool bar
|toolbar-refresh
  toolbar-refresh - Update the tool bar
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __toolbar__  
  __toolbar-open__  
  __toolbar-close__  
  __toolbar-refresh__


## DESCRIPTION


  The toolbar is one or more fixed buffers that typically appear at the
  left-hand edge of the window that contains different tools that assist in
  editing the buffer. The toolbar is really a container for tools and short
  cuts which are configured by the user depending on the tool that has been
  loaded. The tools themselves are buffer context sensitive, the
  [buffer-init(3)](buffer-init(3)) command automatically re-configures the toolbar for the
  buffer at run time.

  The configuration of the toolbar is stored in command variables `.toolvar.*`
  which are used to control the toolbar. The tools that are available in
  toolbar are determined from the file `toollist.emf` which is loaded when the
  toolbar is started. User defined toolbars may be added by redefinging the
  toolbar variables at runtime.

  __toolbar__ toggles the visibility of the toolbar, i.e. if the toolbar is open
  it is closed and vica versa. If the numeric argument _n_ is specified then
  zero closes the toolbar and non-zero opens the toolbar. __toolbar-open__
  initializes and starts the toolbar if it is not already running. The
  toolbar is loaded and instantiated in the system. The toolbar may be
  subsequently closed using __toolbar-close__. Whilst the toolbar is running
  then the content of the tollbar may become out of date, the command
  [toolbar-refresh(3)](toolbar-refresh(3)) forces the toolbar to be re-evaluated and the content
  is updated.


## CONFIGURATION


  The toolbar is configured with command variables __.toolbar.*__. The size
  information of the toolbar is defined with the following variables:-

  _.toolbar.width_
  
  >  Defines the default width of the left-hand vertical toolbar.

  _.toolbar.depth_
  
  >  Defines the default depth of the top horizontal toolbar.

  The tools within the toolbar are configured with the following variables.
  Each variable is divided into fields, each field represents a single tool.
  The fields are separated with the `\CH` character. The order of the fields
  MUST be the same in each of the variables such that the field content
  matches the tool that is being defined.

  _.tool-flag_
  
  The __.tool-flag__ variable describes the behaviour of the tool, this is
  defined as a bitmask as follows:-

  >  `0x000001` - Update on creation
  
  > >   Call the tool update command when the tool is created, this is
        typically required when the content of the toolbar is generated.

  >  `0x000002` - Update on redraw
   
  > >   Call the tool update command when a [redraw](recenter(2)) operation has been
        performed.

  >  `0x000004` - Buffer type changed
  
  > >   Call the tool update command when the buffer type has changed, a
        change of buffer type requires that a buffer specific tool is
        reconfigured.

  >  `0x000008` - Current buffer changed
 
  > >   Call the tool update command when the current buffer is changed, a
        change of buffer buffer requires that a buffer content specific
        tool is reconfigured.

  >  `0x000010` - Current buffer modified or saved

  > >   Call the tool update command when the current buffer is modified
        or saved.

  >  `0x000080` - Perform update checks

  > >   On an update check the toolbar for changes in content.

  > `0x000100` - Lock depth and width
    
  > >   Lock the depth and width of the tool.

  >  `0x000200` - Tool uses a paged window

  > >   The tool uses a paged window in the toolbar (i.e. only one tool
        has focus).

  >  `0x000400` - Tool is hidden

  > >   The tool is currently hidden. When in this state the not active
        sub-page 0x200 will also be set.

  >  `0x000800` - Tool paged window, not first user.

  > >   The tool is part of a paged window and is not the first tool.

  >   `0x001000` - position in the left toolbar

  > >   The tool is present in the left toolbar, on toolbar creation the
        tool is automatically loaded into the toolbar.

  >  `0x002000` - position in the top toolbar

  > >   The tool is present in the top toolbar, on toolbar creation the
        tool is automatically loaded into the toolbar.

  >  `0x004000` - position in the right toolbar

  > >   The tool is present in the right toolbar, on toolbar creation the
        tool is automatically loaded into the toolbar.

  >  `0x008000` - position in the bottom toolbar

  > >   The tool is present in the bottom toolbar, on toolbar creation the
        tool is automatically loaded into the toolbar.

  >  `0x010000` - Include buffer type in mode-line (Prefix)

  > >   The buffer type is included in the toolbar mode line as a prefix.

  >  `0x020000` - Include buffer name in mode-line (suffix)
   
  > >   The buffer name is included in the toolbar mode line as a suffix.

  >  `0x040000` - Include buffer filename in mode-line (suffix)

  > >   The buffer file name is included in the toolbar mode line as a
        suffix.

  >  `0x100000` - Restore window location after an update

  > >   The position of the hilighted line in the toolbar is restored
        after an update.

  >  `0x200000` - Move position to beginning of buffer after an update

  > >   The position of the hilighted line is restored to the top of the
        buffer following an update.

  _.toolbar.tool-name_
 
  >   The name of the tool that is displayed to the user.

  _.toolbar.tool-descs_
  
  >  A short description of the tool which is used in the tool selection
     dialog.

  _.toolbar.tool-buffs_
  
  >  The name of the buffer which is used to store toolbar information. The
     names are usually __*name*__ so that they are not saved.

  _.toolbar.tool-files_
  
  >  The macro file to load when the tool is loaded, if a tool is not used
     then the macros that define the tool are not loaded.

  _.toolbar.tool-cmds_
  
  >  The creation and update commands to run when the command is created.

! 3 abbrev-list
## NAME


  abbrev-list - Create a list of abbreviations


## SYNOPSIS


  __abbrev-list__


## DESCRIPTION


  __abbrev-list__ operates opens a new pop-up window and displays a list of
  abbreviations that are available. Selecting an abbreviation within the
  window with the mouse inserts the abbreviation into the current buffer.

  The abbreviations are defined by the [XXX.eaf](eaf(8)) abbreviation file, where `XXX`
  is the buffer template. The abbreviation file is defined to the buffer
  using [buffer-abbrev-file(2)](buffer-abbrev-file(2)) which is configured and loaded by
  [buffer-init(3)](buffer-init(3)).

  When the [toolbar(3)](toolbar(3)) is enabled then the command does not produce a pop-up
  window, the abbreviation list may be found (or added) to the toolbar.

! 3 c-to-cpp-convert
## NAME


  c-to-cpp-convert - Convert a C file to C++


## SYNOPSIS


  __c-to-cpp-convert__


## DESCRIPTION


  __c-to-cpp-convert__ changes the buffer type from C to C++ and loads the C++
  language template [cpp(9)](cpp(9)). The command is only available once a 'C' file is
  loaded as the command is defined within the C language template file
  `hkc.emf`.

  The command is normally used when a new C++ file is being created, if the
  default file type is C rather than C++ then the new file is converted to
  C++ by changing the magic string from `-*- c -*-` to `-*- c++ -*-`, whenever
  the file is subsequently loaded then it will be presented in the correct
  mode.

  __c-deslashify__


## DESCRIPTION


  __c-slashify__ and __c-deslashify__ add and remove backslash characters to the
  ends of line(s) defined by a region, respectively.

  The commands are used with the C programming language for `#define` macro
  editing, allowing backslashes to be added and removed quickly. Backslashes
  are typically removed with __c-deslashify__ and the macro edited before the
  backslashes are re-applied using __c-slashify__.

## DESCRIPTION


  __delete-hilight-lines__ deletes all lines in the buffer that are hilighted
  with a line color scheme applied by [osd-search(3)](osd-search(3)) or [line-scheme(3)](line-scheme(3)).
  Deletion is only performed on the user hilight lines, [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3))
  annotation lines that use a line based hilight scheme are not removed.

  The line hilighting may be used to mark up lines that are not required,
  typically in debugging logs, and then delete those lines using
  __delete-hilight-lines__.

## NAME


|copy-rectangle
  copy-rectangle - Copy a rectangular region of text
|yank-rectangle-overwrite
  yank-rectangle-overwrite - Insert a column of text with overwrite
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __copy-rectangle__  
  __yank-rectangle-overwrite__


## DESCRIPTION


  __copy-rectangle__ copies a rectangle (or column) of text defined between the
  cursor and the [set-mark](set-mark(2)) position. The text between the mark column and the
  cursor column is copied from every line between the mark line and the
  cursor line inclusive and copied to the kill buffer. The copied text may
  then be extracted from the kill buffer using [yank(2)](yank(2)), [yank-rectangle(2)](yank-rectangle(2)) or
  __yank-rectangle-overwrite__.

  The mark position may be ahead or behind the current cursor position. If
  the rectangle column boundary divides a tab character which spans multiple
  columns, the tab character is replaced with the equivalent number of
  spaces. Similarly if the boundary divides an unprintable character which
  is displayed using multiple characters (e.g. '`^A`' for character 0x01) then
  spaces are inserted before the character to move it to the right of the
  boundary.

  __yank-rectangle-overwrite__ replaces a column of text with the current kill
  buffer, overwriting existing text with the contents of the kill buffer.
  The kill buffer should contain a rectangle region acquired with
  __copy-rectangle__ or [kill-rectangle(2)](kill-rectangle(2)). The current cursor position
  identifies the top left of the column to be written, the width of the
  column to be replaced is determined by the width of the kill buffer text
  being inserted.

  Where an overwrite is not required then use [yank-rectangle(2)](yank-rectangle(2)).

## INTRODUCTION


  MicroEmacs supports folding editor type features that allow folds to be
  created, deleted and traversed. Folded regions of the file may be entered
  and edited whilst hiding information in other folds. Folds may also be
  opened in-line such that more than one fold is visible at any time.

  The __fold__ operation has different semantics than [collapse](collapse-current(3)) which simply
  hides information with a single narrow and does not provide features such
  as entering the fold.


## DESCRIPTION


  __fold-create__ creates a new fold from the text defined between the cursor
  and the [set-mark](set-mark(2)) position. The text between the mark line and the cursor
  line inclusive are then folded and fold markers are inserted into the
  buffer. The folded line may be commented with a fold comment. The fold may
  be subsequently removed with __fold-remove__ which removes the fold under the
  cursor, deleting any fold annotations.

  __fold-open__ opens the fold under the cursor, the fold is expanded in line
  such that the contents of the fold are visible. The fold may be
  subsequently closed using __fold-close__ when the body of the text is hidden
  underneath a fold marker.

  __fold-enter__ enters a fold under the cursor and the contents of the fold are
  reveled the rest of the buffer is narrowed out. The previous fold level
  may be restored with __fold-exit__. Where the fold nesting is deep then
  __fold-exit-all__ may be used to return to the top level.

  __fold-kill__ deletes the fold under the cursor and all of the information
  contained within the fold. [undo(2)](undo(2)) will restore the fold if this was not
  the required action.


## DEFINITION


  Any file may be folded provided that the opening and closing fold strings
  are defined. Folding may be defined and initialized for a file type using
  [buffer-init(3)](buffer-init(3)) by defining the fhopok-XXX.fold variable to define the
  opening and closing fold markers. i.e.

```{.emf}
        set-variable .fhook-XXX.fold "<open> <close>"

```

  Where _<open>_ and _<close>_ are the opening and closing fold strings.

  Folding may also be introduced on a file basis by defining the sold
  markers in the magic string by assignment of the open and close fold
  strings through the variables __fold-open:__ and __fold-close:__. The macro file
  `fold.emf` does this to fold a MicroEmacs macro file as follows:-

```{.emf}
        ; -!- emf: fold-open: ";OPEN" ; fold-close: ";CLOSE" ; -!-

        ;OPEN fold-idle
        0 define-macro fold-idle
            !if &lfind "|yank|reyank|" @cl
                fold-region
                2 screen-update
            !endif
            !if &exi :fold-idle
                execute-line :fold-idle
            !endif
        !emacro
        ;CLOSE

```

## NAME


|narrow-search-forward
  narrow-search-forward - Search for a string in the forward direction
|narrow-search-backward
  narrow-search-backward - Search for a string in the backward direction
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __narrow-search-forward__ "_string_" (__C-c s__)  
  _n_ __narrow-search-backward__ "_string_" (__C-c r__)


## DESCRIPTION


  __narrow-search-forward__ searches for a string from the current cursor
  position to the end of the file and will open up and search through
  [narrow(2m)](narrow(2m)) regions to search for the string. This differs from the
  [search-forward(2)](search-forward(2)) command that does not search through narrow regions.

  The string is typed on the bottom line of the screen, and terminated with
  the `<ESC>` key. Special characters can be typed in by preceding them with a
  `^Q`. A single `^Q` indicates a null string. On successive searches, hitting
  `<ESC>` alone causes the last search string to be reused.

  Searching is affected by [magic(2m)](magic(2m)) mode, which allows regular expression
  pattern matching, and [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) mode which makes the search case
  sensitive.

  The numeric argument _n_ is interpreted as follows:-

  __n > 0__
  
  >  The _n_th occurrence of the _string_ is located.

  __n < 0__
  
  >  The first occurrence of the _string_ is located in the next _n_ lines.

  __narrow-search-backward__ searches backwards in the file. In all other ways
  it is like __narrow-search-forward__.


## DIAGNOSTICS


  The command returns a status of `FALSE` if the _string_ could not be located
  (or _n_th _string_ where _n_ occurrences are requested). If the _string_ is found
  within the given search criteria the return status is `TRUE`.

! 3 xfind
! 5 %xfind-com
## NAME


  xfind - Execute find command  
  %xfind-com - Find command line
$a


## SYNOPSIS


|xfind
  _n_ __xfind__ "_base-path_" "_file-search_"

  __%xfind-com__ "_string_"; Default is "`find`"


## DESCRIPTION


  __xfind__ executes the __find(1)__ command with the command line set by the
  [%xfind-com(5)](%xfind-com(5)) variable and the user supplied base-path and file-search
  regular expression. The output of the command is piped into the __*find*__
  buffer.

  If an argument is given then a [pipe-shell-command(2)](pipe-shell-command(2)) is used instead of
  [ipipe-shell-command(2)](ipipe-shell-command(2)), this is useful when used in macros as it ensures
  that __find__ has finished before the command returns.

  The find command is specified by the macro variable __%xfind-com__ if not
  defined the default `find` is used. The command line run by __xfind__ is

  _%xfind-com_ -name "_base-path_" -name "_file-search_" -print

  The resultant files found are displayed in the __*find*__ buffer and may be
  selected by double-clicking with the mouse left button or selecting the
  line with a `<RETURN>`. The selected file under the cursor is loaded.


## EXAMPLE


  The __xfind__ command does not typically need to be set up in UNIX
  environments. In the Microsoft Windows environment then the UNIX tools for
  Windows are recommended, available from:

       http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/

  The __xfind__ command may be set up in the startup files as follows:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable %xfind-com "c:/usr/local/wbin/find.exe"

```

! 3 write-region
## NAME


  write-region - Write contents of region to named (new) file
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __write-region__ "_file-name_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __write-region__ is used to write the contents of a selected region of a
  buffer to a NEW file i.e. where the region exists between _point___ and ___mark_.

  __write-buffer__ writes the contents of the current region to the named file  
  _file-name_. The action of the write also changes the file name associated
  with the current buffer to the new file name.

  On writing the region, if [time(2m)](time(2m)) mode is enabled then the
  [time stamp]($timestamp(5)) is searched for in the file and modified
  if located, to reflect the  modification date and time.

  If the region contains a [narrow(2m)](narrow(2m)) it will automatically be removed
  before saving so that the whole region is saved and restored when saving
  is complete.

  The argument _n_ may be used to change the default behavior of write-region
  described above, _n_ is a bit based flag where:-

  __0x01__
  
  >  Enables validity checks (default). These include a check that the
     proposed file does not already exist, if so confirmation of writing is
     requested from the user. Also MicroEmacs 2009 checks all other current
     buffers for one with the proposed file name, if found, again
     confirmation is requested. Without this flag the command will always
     succeed wherever possible.

  __0x02__
  
  >  Disables the expansion of any narrows (see [narrow-buffer(2)](narrow-buffer(2))) before
     saving the buffer.


## NOTES


  [undo(2)](undo(2)) information may be discarded when the file is written.

  __write-region__ is a macro defined in `misc.emf`, this macro was used as an
  example for [Writing MicroEmacs Macros](macroWriting(4)).

! 3 watch
! 3 watch-time
! 3 watch-reset
## NAME


  watch - Watch a file
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __watch__  
  _n_ __watch-reset__  
  __watch-time__


## DESCRIPTION


  __watch__ monitors a file on the file system by periodically polling the file
  and reacquiring the contents into a buffer. The command is typically used
  to monitor build and logging files as their output changes under control
  of a background process. Any number of files may be watched
  simultaneously, however to minimize the number of file system transfers,
  only those buffers that are being viewed in a window are updated.

  __watch__ operates in three different modes:-

  __Mode 1 (Reload)__
  
  >  On a re-fresh the existing buffer is emptied and the file contents are
     re-read in their entirety from the file system if the file has
     changed. This is the default mode of operation.

  __Mode 2 (Reload, Append)__
  
  >  On enabling the watch then the complete file is re-read, changes are
     subsequently read as deltas from the end of the file. This mode
     ensures that the buffer contents are up to date before incrementally
     reading the file.

  __Mode 3 (Append)__
  
  >  On enabling the watch then only the end of the file that has not been
     read before is appended to the end of the buffer. This method is ideal
     for large log files.

  The operational mode may be selected by passing a numeric value of `1`, `2` or
  `3` to the __watch__ command. If no numeric argument is provided then the user
  is prompted for the operational mode.

  Whilst running in an append mode (`2` or `3`) then byte offset of the end of
  the file is retained for the next read. On the next read then any new
  information from the last saved byte offset to the end of the file is
  read, irrespective of any edits made to the buffer. Therefore if the
  buffer contents have been deleted on the next _append_ read then the buffer
  will contain the appended information only and not reacquire the
  information that has been deleted. Where the complete buffer is to be
  re-acquired then use __Mode 1__.

  The buffer mode line is modified to show the watch state. i.e.

      ==W <buffer-name> ==============


  Invocation of __watch__ in a buffer that is being watched disables the watch.
  All watches may be removed from all buffers using `0 watch-reset`.

  __watch-time__ modifies the poll time of a watch. The user is prompted for the
  time period which is entered in seconds.

  __watch-reset__ re-evaluates the watches that are on the buffers reporting the
  number of files that are bing watched. When invoked with a `0` argument then
  any outstanding watch commands are removed.


## NOTES


  __watch__ is a macro implemented in `watch.emf`.

  The commands __watch-reset__ and __watch-time__ are not available until a __watch__
  command has been executed.


## HISTORY


  __watch__ was developed in 2000 and appeared in MicroEmacs releases after this
  date however the comand was not exported to the user. The __watch__ command
  was fully integrated in the 2005 release.

## NAME


  notes - Tagged hierarchical database of notes.
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __notes__  
  __notes-file__  
  __notes-close__  
  __notes-context__  
  __notes-instant__


## DESCRIPTION


  __notes__ is a note database that allows miscellaneous text information to be
  organized and retained in a database. Each note is has a label associated
  with it which may be hierarchically organized into a tree of notes.

  Information that a programmer would typically put into a notes database
  may include:-

  - How to mount a CD-ROM on a remote UNIX system.
  - Boot strapping Linux.
  - Configuring the C compiler.
  - etc..

  This information would be hierarchically organized by system, function
  etc. The content typically represents a snippet of information from a
  diverse range of subjects that probably needs to be accessed infrequently
  but organized in such a way that it may be located quickly when required.

  On running __notes__ then a new frame is created (retaining the existing
  window configuration) and the user is prompted to create a new notes file
  with their user name, accept this option and a new notes file is created
  in the JASSPA home directory. The user is presented with a split view
  window as follows:-

      +-------------+-----------------------------------+
      | + user Pad  |Text associated with the note.     |
      |*  +- info 1 |                                   |
      |   +- info 2 |Anything may be typed in here.     |
      |             |                                   |
      |             |                                   |
      |             |                                   |
      |             |                                   |
      +=User Pad====+=*User Pad: info 1* ===============+
      |                                                 |
      +-------------------------------------------------+


  The left pane comprises a tree of note titles, the right pane contains the
  text note body of the selected note title. Free form text may be entered
  into the text body pane.

  Notes are add and removed from the notes tree pane. A mouse right click
  presents a menu of options that operate on the current node as follows:-

  __Tidy Tree__ - `t`/`return`
  
  >  At the current node then close the note hierarchy. `t` will close the
     node a RETURN at the node will open or close it, depending on the
     current state.

  __Rename Note__ - `r`
  
  >  Edit the name of the note, a dialog is presented and a free form label
     of the note may be edited.

  __Delete Note__ - `delete`
  
  >  Delete the note from the tree. This deletes the label and the note. if
     the note has any children then all children are deleted.

  __Cut Note__ - `x`
  
  >  Delete a note, including any child notes from the tree, allowing the
     cut information to be pasted back to a different location in the tree.
     (See __Paste__ __Note__).

  __Paste Note__ - `v`
  
  >  Inserts a cut note (or note tree) back into the list at the current
     position.

  __Move Note Up__ - `u`
  
  >  Move a note up the tree hierarchy, at the same level.

  __Move Note Down__ - `d`
  
  >  Move a note down the tree hierarchy, at the same level.

  __Insert New Note__ - `insert`
  
  >  Insert a new note as a child of the current node. The user is prompted
     for the name of the note, the name may be entered and the cursor is
     left in the body pane for text entry.

  __Forward Note__ - `n`
  
  >  Moves to the next note. Within the note window then __C-page-down__
     similarly advances to the next note.

  __Backward Note__ - `p`
  
  >  Moves to the previous note. Within the note window then __C-page-up__
     similarly advances to the previous note.

  __Search Forward__ - `esc s`
  
  >  Search in a forwards direction from the current note.

  __Search Backward__ - `esc C-s`
  
  >  Search in a backwards direction from the current note.

  __Open Notes File__
  
  >  Opens a new notes file, the user is explicitly prompted for the name
     of the notes file to open.

  __Save Notes File__
  
  >  Saves the notes file to the file system.

  __Hide Notes__
  
  >  Hides the notes window and restores the exiting buffer windows prior
     to the __notes__ invocation.

  To quit __notes__ then delete the buffer using __C-x C-k__ or run the command
  __notes-close__ command.

  The notes file may be saved like any other buffer using [save-buffer(2)](save-buffer(2))
  (`C-x C-s`). This saves the tree and the notes. Auto-save is automatically
  enabled.

  __notes-close__ closes the notes frame and returns the user to the existing
  windows, retaining the same screen layout. The notes file is still
  resident in the editor and may be restored with a __notes__ command.

  __notes-file__ opens a new notes file, the user is explicitly prompted for the
  name of the notes file. There are no restrictions on the number of notes
  files that may be created. __notes-import-skwyrul__ imports a Skwyrul index
  file (`skwyrul_l.htm`) into MicroEmacs notes format. This command is not
  available on line as it is likely to be used very infrequently. To load
  the command then load the file `notesutl.emf` and execute the buffer
  [execute-buffer(2)](execute-buffer(2)) (esc x execute-buffer). The command may be explicitly
  run using `esc x` `notes-import-skwyrul`.

  __notes-instant__ creates a new note under the _Instant Notes_ folder, it is
  designed to enable the user to jot something down quickly and in a safe
  place. The note is automatically named and is the fastest method of adding
  a note. This may be invoked outside of the notes window, on invocation
  then a new notes node is created and the content of the note added.

  __notes-context__ is similar to __notes-instant__ but a bit more advanced and
  allows a note to be created that is associated with a buffer. When working
  on a file (source code, document etc.). It is sometimes useful to be able
  to associate some information with that file, typically this is done with
  something like a `TODO:` comment, however this is not always appropriate.
  __notes-context__ attempts to address this, it works from the current buffers
  filename path and attempts to locate an existing note for it, if no note
  is found then a new one is created. When locating a note it looks down the
  path. The command may be invoked outside of the notes window, on
  invocation then a new notes node is created and the content of the note
  added.


## Text Hilighting 


  Blocks of text within the notes body may be highlighted. The special
  constructs of `>format>` ... `>end>` located on the left margin introduce and
  close a highlighting style. i.e.

      >c>
      /* This is a C code insert */
      >end>

      >perl>
      # This is a perl insert
      >end>


  The keywords that are supported are:-

      `>emf>` - MicroEmacs macro files.
      `>pseudo>` - Pseudo code.
      `>bnf>` - BNF.
      `>c>` - C programming language
      `>cpp>` - C++ programming language
      `>perl>` - Perl programming language
      `>tcl>` - TCL programming language
      `>shell>` - UNIX shell scripts
      `>make>` - Makefile scripts
      `>end>` - Ends the highlighting block.


## NOTES


  __notes__ is a macro implemented in `notes.emf`. The database information is
  stored in a single file _user___.enf__. The file comprises both the index and
  the text.

  The implementation of __notes__ uses [narrow-buffer(2)](narrow-buffer(2)) to hide information for
  each note page. The [Registry](Registry) is used to store and display the note tree
  labels.

## NAME


  browse - Browse a file or buffer in view mode
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __browse__


## DESCRIPTION


  __browse__ is a simple utility that assists buffer viewing by mapping the
  basic keys to navigation functions. __browse__ may be invoked on any buffer.

  On invoking __browse__ then the buffer is placed into a simple viewing mode
  allowing the contents of the file to be viewed and the buffer cannot be
  edited. The key bindings that are recognized include:-

      `SPACE`, `RETURN` - Next page.
      `BACKSPACE` - Previous page.
      `C-n` - Scroll down .
      `C-p` - Scroll up.
      `C-f` - Scroll right.
      `C-b` - Scroll left.
      `C-g` - Quit browse mode.
      `/` - Search forward, initiates a forwards search.
      `w` - Toggle wrap mode, wraps long lines to screen width.

  To quit browse mode then issue a __C-g__ _abort_ command.

! 3 save-session
## NAME


  save-session - Write session information to session file
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __save-session__ "_session-file_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __save-session__ writes out MicroEmacs 2009's current session information into
  the given session file.

  The command [read-session(3)](read-session(3)) can set a default session file in which case
  the session is automatically written out to this file if an argument of
  zero is given; the user is not prompted for a file. MicroEmacs 2009
  automatically tries to write the default session whenever it is exited.


## NOTES


  The session information is saved in a ascii format file (see [esf(8)](esf(8))).
  Reference should be made to the notes included in [esf(8)](esf(8)) as to how the
  session file may be edited and effected in the same MicroEmacs 2009
  session.

!! me-id: m3mac081
! 3 read-session
## NAME


  read-session - Read in session information
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __read-session__ [ "_session-file_" ]


## DESCRIPTION


  __read-session__ reads in a MicroEmacs 2009 session file, setting the current
  session information. If argument __n__ is not given then the given
  "_session-file_" is simply read in. If a non-zero argument is specified then
  default session is set to the given file-name and the file is read. If an
  argument of zero is given then the default session is re-read. Information
  read in (and saved) from the history file includes:-

  - Searching and replacing history.
  - Buffer name history.
  - Command name history.
  - File name history.
  - General (all the rest) history.
  - Buffer and file list with line numbers.

  MicroEmacs 2009's environment may be retained almost intact by the use of
  the default session and using the __-c__ (continue) command-line option to
  re-load all files that were being edited in a previous session.

  On loading a new session then the user is prompted to save the current
  session. If the numeric argument is zero (bit 0 is 0) then the user is not
  prompted and the _session-file_ is effectively loaded and merged into the
  current session.


## NOTES


  When running multiple MicroEmacs 2009 sessions on the same work-station
  (or different workstations sharing the same home directory), the default
  history is saved when MicroEmacs 2009 exits. As a result the last
  MicroEmacs 2009 sessions that terminates writes the history information
  used next time.

  The session information is saved in a registry format file (see [esf(8)](esf(8))).
  Reference should be made to the notes included in [erf(8)](erf(8)) as to how the
  history file may be edited and effected in the same MicroEmacs 2009
  session.

  The user may now have multiple sessions, this is useful when one is
  working on different projects, the sessions are created using
  [save-session(3)](save-session(3)) using a new session name. Starting the editor with a
  different session means that the hilighting scheme may be different
  between different sessions i.e. "_Blue_ _Hue_" and "_Sherwoord_ _Forest_". Note
  that the color scheme should be changed with [change-scheme(3)](change-scheme(3)) and not with
  [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) if different sessions are to use different color schemes.


## Command Line 


  Reading a session is generally performed when a MicroEmacs session is
  started using the "__-c__" command line option rather than from the emacs mode
  line or main menu, see [me(1)](me(1)). Invoking

  >  __me -c___<mySessionName>_

  where _<mySessionName>_ is the name of the session (the [$MENAME(5)]($MENAME(5)) or system
  login name) will restore all of of the buffers, windows layout, point and
  mark positions, main window size etc. at the point of the last shut down.
  e.g. given a system login name of _jasspa_ then

  >  __me -c___jasspa_

  restores the session to the state when _jasspa_ last exited MicroEmacs. When
  the session name is specified then no other files should be specified, so
  the command line

  >  __me -c___jasspa_ `morefiles.txt`

  restores the buffers but does not restore the window layout because this
  has been destroyed by the introduction of the new file "`morefiles.txt`".
  This type of command with another file behaves as the old "`me -c`" command
  prior to the 2006 release that did not support sessions. If
  _<mySessionName>_ is not specified then the buffers are restored but the
  window layout is not restored.

  indent-increase - Increase the line indentation  
  indent-decrease - Decrease the line indentation
$a


## SYNOPSIS


|indent-increase
  _indent-increase_
|indent-decrease
  _n_ __indent-decrease__


## DESCRIPTION


  __indent-increase__ increases the indentation of a line or selection region by
  the numeric argument _n_ tab stops defined by [$buffer-indent-width(5)]($buffer-indent-width(5)). If
  the argument is negative then the indentation is reduced by the specified
  number of tab stops. The default when omitted is a single indentation
  level.

  __indent-decrease__ operates in the same way as __indent-increase__ except the
  indentation is decreased.


## NOTES


  __indent-increase__ and __indent-decrease__ are defined in `format.emf`.

! 3 xdiff
! 5 %xdiff-com
## NAME


  xdiff - External graphical file difference  
  %xdiff-com - Extenal graphical differnce xdiff(1) command line
$a


## SYNOPSIS


|xdiff
  __xdiff__ "_leftVersion_" "_rightVersion_"
|%xdiff-com
  `%xdiff-com` "_string_"

  X-Windows "`xdiff -wb %lf %rf`" when using __xdiff__ from
  _http://reality.sgiweb.org/rudy/xdiff/_

  MS-Windows "`bc2.exe %lf %rf /title1=%lt /title2=%rt`" when using Beyond
  Compare.


## DESCRIPTION


  __xdiff__ is a macro wrapper that invokes an external graphical file
  difference utility, named after the original X-Windows utility of the same
  name. The utility will usually display two files side by side and color
  code the differences, the differences may then be selected to merge the
  changes into a new output file which may (or may not) overwrite one of the
  original input files.

  __xdiff__ executes the difference utility __xdiff(1)__ command (or equivalent)
  with the command line set by the __%xdiff-com__ variable and the user supplied
  files _leftVersion_ and _rightVersion_. The command line variables are
  referenced from the __%xdiff-com__ as follows:

  __%lf__
  
  >  The absolute file name of the left-hand file, _leftVersion_.

  __%rf__
  
  >  The absolute file name of the right-hand file, _rightVersion_.

  __%ln__
  
  >  The base name of the left-hand file, _leftVersion_.

  __%rn__
  
  >  The base name of the left-hand file, _leftVersion_.

  The __%xdiff-com__ variable should include the appropriate command to invoke
  the difference utility and use __%__ place holders for the arguments.
  MicroEmacs will fill in the __%__ arguments with their correct values on
  invocation.

  __UNIX__
  
  >  UNIX environments may use __xdiff(1)__ which is available from
     __http://reality.sgiweb.org/rudy/xdiff/__. The variable command line may
     be defined as:

```{.emf}
            set-variable %xdiff-com "xdiff -wb %lf %rf"

```

  The __-wb__ options will ignore while space and trailing blanks.

  __Microsoft Windows__
  
  >  Microsoft Windows environments may use something like __Beyond Compare__.
     The variable command line may be defined as:

```{.emf}
            set-variable %xdiff-com "bc2.exe %lf %rf /title1=%lt /title2=%rt"

```

  In this case the __%lt__ values have been used for the title names for each of
  the windows in the utility.


## NOTES


  __xdiff__ is a macro defined in `tools.emf`, inspired by the UNIX utility of the
  same name __xdiff(1)__

$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __change-scheme__ _"schemeName"_


## DESCRIPTION


  __change-scheme__ changes the current highlight scheme used by the editor to
  the new scheme _schemeName_ which is the ASCII name of the scheme. The
  change is immediate and the change in scheme is retained in the session.
  Note that the __tab__ key provides a completion list from the command line
  prompt.

  __cc-update__


## DESCRIPTION


  The ClearCase and sub-commands provide MicroEmacs with an interface to IBM
  Rational Software __ClearCase(1)__. __ClearCase__ is a version control system;
  using it, you can record the history of your source file modifications.
  ClearCase is licensed from IBM Rational and is widely used in a commercial
  environment, see the documentation provided with ClearCase for more
  information on its features and use.

  The __ClearCase__ directory should be defined to MicroEmacs using [cc-setup(3)](cc-setup(3))
  which enables extensions in the [file-browser(3)](file-browser(3)) with an additional
  "`*cc-console*`" window. The "`*files*`" window includes additional columns
  showing the ClearCase state, revision and repository date. The
  functionality of the file-browser is the same as a non-ClearCase folder
  with the exception that additional ClearCase item controls are located in
  the mouse context menu (opened by clicking the right mouse button in the
  `*files*` buffer). This menu item opens another sub-menu providing access to
  the items below. When selecting commands than a pop-up check-box may be
  displayed which allows options to be selected for the command.

  __Current State__
  
  >  Checks the state of selected file(s) or directory against the
     repository. Differences detected are shown in the `*cc-state*` window.
     This provides a quick method of determining the working directory
     state.

  >  The `*cc-state*` buffer supports some of the same features as a
     directory listing, the files can be loaded (using `return` or left click
     on the file name), selected (using space or left mouse button on the
     left hand edge) and ClearCase commands executed from the window
     operate either on the selected files or the listed files if no files
     are selected.

  __Update Elements__
  
  >  Updates the currently selected files, files are selected by clicking
     the left button to the left of the required file name. Multiple files
     may be selected by 'dragging' a hilight region over the required
     files.

  __Clear CC console__
  
  >  Clears the _*cc-console*_ buffer.

  The following sections describe some of the ClearCase commands that are
  available, a full list of commands may be found using [command-apropos(2)](command-apropos(2))
  searching for __cc__ which provides a full list of all of the ClearCase
  related commands.

  The __cc-add__ command adds the current buffer file to the repository.

  The __cc-checkout__ command checks out a file or directory from the repository
  into the current directory, the read-only status of the file is changed to
  read-write, the user is prompted for a comment which will be used on a
  subsequent check-in operation. The user specifies the file on the message
  line.

  The __cc-checkin__ command commits any changes made to the currently buffer's
  file (including additions) to the repository. The user is prompted for a
  commit log message, the file state will change to read-only.

  The __cc-diff__ command opens a _*cc-diff*_ window displaying the differences
  between the current buffer's local file and repository version. If the
  current buffer is a directory list it will list all the differences found
  in all files within the directory.

  The __cc-delete__ command removes the current buffer's file from the
  repository.

  The __cc-state__ command opens a _*cc-state*_ window listing the state of any
  file in the current directory which is not up-to-date. Note that unlike
  most ClearCase sub commands this command executes over all files in the
  current buffer's file directory.

  The __cc-update__ command updates all files in the current directory, the
  output being reported to a new _*cc-update*_ window. Note that unlike most
  ClearCase sub commands this command executes over all files in the current
  buffer's file directory.


## Setup 


  __cc-setup__ provides a dialog interface to configure the MicroEmacs ClearCase
  interface if required. The VOB view location in the file system should be
  added for each view that is to be access by MicroEmacs.

  A __Tools__ tab exists to configure each of the __cleartool(1)__ options, these
  may be configured to suite the users preferences.

  __cc-setup__ may also be accessed from [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) from the __Miscellaneous__
  configuration.


## ClearCase File Browser 


  The __ClearCase File Browser__ is an extension to the [file-browser(3)](file-browser(3)) and
  shows the state of ClearCase files in a directory listing.


## NOTES


  __ClearCase__ and sub-commands are macros defined in file `clearcs.emf`.

## NAME


|insert-password
  insert-password - Create and insert a new password string
|password-to-phonic
  password-to-phonic - Convert a password to phonic string
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __insert-password__  
  __password-to-phonic__ "_password_"


## DESCRIPTION


  The password commands are typically used by a system administrator to
  generate new random passwords or to phonically unambiguously describe a
  password.

  __insert-password__ generates a new random password string and inserts the
  generated password with phonic description into the current buffer. The
  generated password minimally includes include at least one each of
  lowercase, uppercase and numeric characters. The default length of the
  password is 8 characters, the numeric argument _n_ changes the length of the
  generated password and must be at least 3 characters long. Running 4
  insert-password to generate a 4 character password generates:

       y5Ck (yankee - Five - CHARLIE - kilo)


  __password-to-phonic__ converts a string of characters to the phonic alphabet,
  the command requires a single argument _password_ which is converted to a
  phonic string. The command __password-to-phonic__ "_y5Ck_" inserts the phonic
  string into the buffer:

       yankee - Five - CHARLIE - kilo


## NOTES


  The password commands are macros defined in `password.emf`.

! 3 buffer-major-mode
## NAME


  buffer-major-mode - Change the operating mode of a buffer


## SYNOPSIS


  __buffer-major-mode__ "_modename_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __buffer-major-mode__ changes the major mode of a buffer affecting the
  highlighting, indentation, key bindings and mode specific commands to the
  specified _modename_. This allows the buffer to be configured correctly for
  the type of file.

  On invocation then the user is prompted for the _modename_, TAB performs
  completion.

  Running __buffer-major-mode__ causes the [File Hook](fileHooks(2)) to be executed for the
  buffer for the new _modename_.


## NOTES


  [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)) may be used to make local changes to the major mode for
  the current buffer only. [major-mode-setup(3)](major-mode-setup(3)) may be used to change the
  major mode settings across all buffers.

! 3 find
! 3 find-setup
## NAME


  find - Execute find command
$a


## SYNOPSIS


|find
  __find__ ["_find-options_"] "_file-mask_" ["_file-mask_"...] ["_starting-path_"]
|find-setup
  __find-setup__


## DESCRIPTION


  __find__ performs a search for files in the current directory (or from
  _starting-path_) using built in MicroEmacs 2009 constructs rather than
  relying on any external executables such as __find(1)__. __find__ operates in
  exactly the same way as a traditional _find_ command line utility and uses a
  command line option sequence from the MicroEmacs 2009 command line. The
  _file-options_ allow recursive and regular expression searches, searching
  against the file modification time etc. The command line takes the user
  supplied _file-options_, _file-mask_ and _starting-path_. The output of the
  command is piped into the __*find*__ buffer.

  _find-options_
  
  >  Defines the _options_ that are specified on the command line, the
     default options may also be defined with the __file-setup(3)__ command
     invoked from the command line or from the the __Tools__ menu. The
     _find-options_ are defined as follows:

  >  __-2__
  
  > >   List the file and directory attributes in the output (directory
        list sort key)

  >  __-3__
  
  > >   List file and directory size in the output.

  >  __-4__
  
  > >   List file and directory modified time in the output.

  >  __-a__
  
  > >   Re-read all out of date buffers, prevents a manual prompt,
        equivalent of Yes to all. This is the inverse of -o

  >  __-b__
  
  > >   Ignore binary files.

  >  __-B__
  
  > >   Do not ignore binary files.

  >  __-d__
  
  > >   List directories or grep in directory listings.

  >  __-D__
  
  > >   Do not list directories or grep in directory listings.

  >  __-f__
  
  > >   List/search files.

  >  __-F__
  
  > >   Do not list/search files.

  >  __-g__
  
  > >   File masks are regex (i.e. .*.emf)

  >  __-G__
  
  > >   File masks are not regex (i.e. *.emf)

  >  __-i__
  
  > >   Ignore search pattern case (case insensitive).

  >  __-I__
  
  > >   Do not ignore search pattern case (case sensitive).

  >  __-l__
  
  > >   Use existing buffer of loaded files.

  >  __-L__
  
  > >   Do not use existing buffer of loaded files.

  >  __-m__
  
  > >   Search pattern is a regular expression.

  >  __-M__
  
  > >   Search pattern is not a regular expression.

  >  __-o__
  
  > >   Do not re-read all out of date buffers, prevents a manual prompt,
            equivalent of No to all. This is the inverse of -a.

  >  __-p__
  
  > >   Starting path specified

  >  __-P__
  
  > >   Starting path not specified

  >  __-r__
  
  > >   Recurse into sub-directories

  >  __-R__
  
  > >   Do not recurse into sub-directories

  >  __-S__ _<size>_
  
  > >   File size - less than or equal, the following size formats are
        supported:

  > >   -S <number> File size specified bytes.

  > >   -S <number>k File size specified in Kilobytes.

  > >   -s <size> File size greater than; supported size formats are the
            same as -S.

  >  __-T__ _<time>_
  
  > >   Modification time - older than, the following time formats are
        supported:

  > >   -T yy-mm-dd

  > >   -T yyyy-mm-dd

  > >   -T yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss

  > >   -T days Offset time in days from midnight this morning, e.g. -T 0
           would match all files not modified today.

  > >   -T days.hours[.minutes[.seconds]] Offset time in , e.g. -T 1.1.30
           matches all files 25 hours and 30 minutes old.

  > >   Note that -T 1 is not the same as -T 1.0, except at midnight.

  >  __-t__ _<time>_
  
  > >   Modification time - newer than or equal, supported time formats
        are the same as -T.

  >  __-u__
  
  > >   When used with -w, allows the file size limit of 100Mb to be
        disabled and strings are searched in files of any size.

  >  __-U__
  
  > >   When used with -U, files are limited in size 100Mb otherwise they
        will not be searched.

  >  __-w__ _<search-pattern>_
  
  > >   File must contain a string matching the given search-pattern.

  _file-mask_
  
  >  The files to search for e.g. __*.txt__

  _starting-path_
  
  >  The directory location where the search should commence. The default
     is the location of the current buffer.

  __file-setup__ invokes a dialogue and allows the default _file-options_ to be
  specified when the __find__ command is invoked.


## NOTES


  - Directories are not considered binary files, so __-b__ will not exclude
        them.
  - The default when no options are given will be __-XGPrdfMIBL__, default
        options can be set via the find-setup command (sets the
        /history/find-com registry entry).
  - Use of __-w__ on directories searches for _<search-pattern>_ within the
        MicroEmacs 2009 directory listing, the command is then the same as
  - [grep(3)](grep(3)) except for the output buffer format.
  - String searches of __-w__ are not performed on files that exceed 100Mb
        unless the -u option is specified on the command line. This prevents
        MicroEmacs 2009 from loading exceptionally large files unless
        explicitly required.

  grep - Search a file for a pattern
$a


## SYNOPSIS


|grep
  __grep__ ["_grep-options_"] _search-pattern_ "_file-mask_" ["_file-mask_"...]
  ["starting-path"]


## DESCRIPTION


  __grep__ performs a search for a pattern and displays all lines that contain
  that pattern within files in the current directory (or from _starting-path_)
  using built in MicroEmacs 2009 constructs rather than relying on any
  external executables such as __grep(1)__. __grep__ operates in exactly the same
  way as a traditional _grep_ command line utility and uses a command line
  option sequence from the MicroEmacs 2009 command line. The _grep-options_
  allow recursive and regular expression searches, searching against the
  file modification time etc. The command line takes the user supplied
  _grep-options_, _search-pattern_, _file-mask_ and _starting-path_. The output of
  the command is piped into the __*grep*__ buffer.

     __-t__ _<time>_
            Modification time - newer than or equal, supported time formats
            are the same as -T.

     __-u__
            When used with -w, allows the file size limit of 100Mb to be
            disabled and strings are searched in files of any size.

     __-U__
            When used with -U, files are limited in size 100Mb otherwise they
            will not be searched.

     __-x__
            Use MicroEmacs 2009 [$file-ignore(5)]($file-ignore(5)) to exclude unimportant files

     __-X__
            Do not use MicroEmacs 2009 [$file-ignore(5)]($file-ignore(5)).

  _file-mask_
  
  >  The files to search for e.g. __*.txt__

  _starting-path_
  
  >  The directory location where the search should commence. The default
     is the location of the current buffer.

  __find-setup__ invokes a dialogue and allows the default _file-options_ to be
  specified when the __find__ command is invoked.


## NOTES


  - Trying to make the command-line look like the standard UNIX __grep(1)__
        command may be more of a hindrance than a help because its not grep.
        No support is provided for options like -w, -l etc.
  - The default when no options are given is __-XGPRDfMIBL__, default
        options may be set via the [find-setup(3)](find-setup(3)) command (sets the
        /history/grep-com registry entry).
  - Use of __-d__ searches for _<search-pattern>_ within the MicroEmacs 2009
        directory listing.
  - It may be advantageous to enable the __-l__ option default using
  - [find-setup(3)](find-setup(3)).

## DESCRIPTION


  __replace-string-in-files__ performs a search for a _from-pattern_ and and
  replaces the string with _to-pattern_ in all files that match _file-mask_ in
  the current directory (or from _starting-path_) using built in MicroEmacs
  2009 constructs rather than relying on any external executables such as
  __grep(1)__.

  __query-replace-string-in-files__ is identical to __replace-string-in-files__
  except the user is prompted to accept each potential replacement.

  _find-options_
  
  >  Defines the _options_ that are specified on the command line, the
     default options may also be defined with the [find-setup(3)](find-setup(3)) command
     invoked from the command line or from the the __Tools__ menu. The
     _find-options_ are defined as follows:

  >  __-2__
  
  > >   List the file and directory attributes in the output (directory
        list sort key)

  >  __-3__
  
  > >   List file and directory size in the output.

  >  __-4__
  
  > >   List file and directory modified time in the output.

  >  __-a __
  
  > >   Re-read all out of date buffers, prevents a manual prompt,
        equivalent of Yes to all. This is the inverse of -o

  >  __-b __
  
  > >   Ignore binary files.

  >  __-B __
  
  > >   Do not ignore binary files.

  >  __-f __
  
  > >   List/search files.

  >  __-F __
  
  > >   Do not list/search files.

  >  __-g __
  
  > >   File masks are regex (i.e. .*.emf)

  >  __-G __
  
  > >   File masks are not regex (i.e. *.emf)

  >  __-i __
  
  > >   Ignore search pattern case (case insensitive).

  >  __-I __
  
  > >   Do not ignore search pattern case (case sensitive).

  >  __-l __
  
  > >   Use existing buffer of loaded files.

  >  __-L __
  
  > >   Do not use existing buffer of loaded files.

  >  __-m __
  
  > >   Search pattern is a regular expression.

  >  __-M __
  
  > >   Search pattern is not a regular expression.

  >  __-o __
  
  > >   Do not re-read all out of date buffers, prevents a manual prompt,
            equivalent of No to all. This is the inverse of -a.

  >  __-p __
  
  > >   Starting path specified

  >  __-P __
  
  > >   Starting path not specified

  >  __-r __
  
  > >   Recurse into sub-directories

  >  __-R __
  
  > >   Do not recurse into sub-directories

  >  __-S__ _<size>_
  
  > >   File size - less than or equal, the following size formats are
        supported:

  > >   -S <number> File size specified bytes.

  > >   -S <number>k File size specified in Kilobytes.

  > >   -s <size> File size greater than; supported size formats are the
            same as -S.

  >  __-T__ _<time>_
  
  > >   Modification time - older than, the following time formats are
        supported:

  > >   -T yy-mm-dd

  > >   -T yyyy-mm-dd

  > >   -T yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss

  > >   -T days Offset time in days from midnight this morning, e.g. -T 0
           would match all files not modified today.

  > >   -T days.hours[.minutes[.seconds]] Offset time in , e.g. -T 1.1.30
           matches all files 25 hours and 30 minutes old.

  > >   Note that -T 1 is not the same as -T 1.0, except at midnight.

  >  __-t__ _<time>_
  
  > >   Modification time - newer than or equal, supported time formats
        are the same as -T.

  >  __-u __

  _file-mask_
  
  >  The files to search for e.g. __*.txt__

  _starting-path_
  
  >  The directory location where the search should commence. The default
     is the location of the current buffer.


## NOTES


  - The location of the find options in the 3rd argument may seem odd,
        but the command is not required to have a single <options> <from>
        <to> <mask> interface as this becomes unwieldy.
  - The default when no options are given is __-XGPRDfMIbL__, default
        options may be set via the [find-setup(3)](find-setup(3)) command (sets
        /history/rsif-com registry entry).
  - The __-d__ option is not supported as [find(3)](find(3)) and error is reported if
        supplied.
  - It may be advantageous to enable the __-l__ option default using
  - [find-setup(3)](find-setup(3)).
  - Use of __-w__ is supported and is separate from the _<from-pattern>_, i.e.
        this option can still be used to filter the files to operate on.
  - __-w__ shares the __-m__ and __-i__ options, i.e if __-m__ is used both the
        <from-pattern> and the <search-pattern> must be a regular expression
        pattern.

! 3 encase
## NAME


  encase - Encase a text region with start/end string
$a


## SYNOPSIS


|encase
  __encase__ "_start-string_" "_end-string_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __encase__ provides a short cut to encapsulate a selected region of text with
  a _start-string_ and _end-string_ pattern. The command is modal and operates
  in two different operating modes as follows.

  First run __encase__ without a current region section (i.e. no selected
  highlighted text) and the user is prompted for the _start-string_ and
  _end-string_. The user is also prompted if the command has not been run
  before and the _start-string_ and _end-string_ are undefined.

  With the strings defined then select a region with the mouse or keyboard
  (__esc space__ and __move__ or __S-move__) to define the start and end point of the
  region. With a selected region then execute the __encase__ command using __esc x__
  __encase__. This is most effective when bound to a simple key, see
  [global-bind-key(2)](global-bind-key(2)).


## NOTES


  __encase__ is a macro defined in `misc.emf`.

! 3 number-items
## NAME


  number-items - Renumber a vertical list of items
$a


## SYNOPSIS


|number-items
  __number-items__ _start-number_ _char-width_ _num-lines_


## DESCRIPTION


  __number-items__ provides a short cut method of re-numbering a list of
  vertically aligned numbered items. The command assumes a fixed width
  number per line. The command operates from the current cursor position in
  a downward direction. The parameters are defined as follows:

  _start-number_
  
  >  The value of the first item to renumber.

  _char-width_
  
  >  The width of the number space i.e. 1-10 is a width of 2, 89-101 is a
     width of 3.

  _num-lines_
  
  >  The number of lines to re-number, including the current line.


## EXAMPLE


  The following code fragment shows how a list is renumbered.

      MY_COMMAND (myCMD_UP,   # 9, "Move Up")
      MY_COMMAND (myCMD_DOWN,  10, "Move down")
      MY_COMMAND (myCMD_LEFT,  15, "Move down")
      MY_COMMAND (myCMD_RIGHT, 10, "Move down")


  To to use the command to renumber the list from 100 to 103 then the cursor
  is placed at the left hand side where the number should start. In the
  example this is `#`, then issue the command __esc x__ __number-items__ __100__ __3__ __4__. This
  renumbers the list resulting in the following:

      MY_COMMAND (myCMD_UP,   100, "Move Up")
      MY_COMMAND (myCMD_DOWN, 101, "Move down")
      MY_COMMAND (myCMD_LEFT, 102, "Move down")
      MY_COMMAND (myCMD_RIGHT,103, "Move down")

## NAME


  jeany-bindings    - creates Geany like bindings with a C-j prefix
  jeany-osd         - creates menu entries for the new jeany bindings
  jeany-osd-undo    - restores the original MicroEmacs menu entries again
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __jeany-bindings__  
  __jeany-osd__  
  __jeany-osd-undo__

## DESCRIPTION

  The command __jeany-bindings__ installs key-bindings similar to the bindings
  you find in the Geany text editor but with a 'C-j' prefix. Such key-bindings
  are probably  more  similar to that what new users  expect.  To  not  break
  the original Emacs  key-bindings all Geany key-bindings are prefixed with the
  _Ctrl-j_  key. The menu  entries can be as well  adapted to show the changed
  key-bindings using the command __jeany-osd__, these changed menu entries can
  be reverted to the normal key bindings using the command __jeany-osd-undo__.
  The  following  key-bindings  are  currently  available  if you  execute the
  command __jeany-bindings__:
  
  
  __File menu commands:__

  - _Ctrl-j C-n_ - find-file (creates a new file if it does not yet exists)
  - _Ctrl-j C-o_ - find-file (open a file)
  - _Ctrl-j C-w_ - delete-buffer (close it)
  - _Ctrl-j C-s_ - save-buffer
  - _Ctrl-j C-r_ - reread-file (refresh the buffer if it has been modified)
  - _Ctrl-j C-p_ - print-buffer
  - _Ctrl-j C-q_ - exit-emacs 
  
  __Edit menu commands:__
  
  - _Ctrl-j Ctrl-z_ - undo (undo editing possible until last save)
  - _Ctrl-j Ctrl-x_ - kill-region (cut marked text)
  - _Ctrl-j Ctrl-c_ - copy-region (copy marked text)
  - _Ctrl-j Ctrl-v_ - yank (paste text)
  - _Ctrl-j V_      - reyank (paste previous copied text(s))
  - _Ctrl-j Ctrl-a_ - jeany-select-all (mark all text)
  
  __Search menu commands:__
 
  - _Ctrl-j Ctrl-f_ - isearch-forward (search forward)
  - _Ctrl-j Ctrl-g_ - hunt-forward (search again)
  - _Ctrl-j G_      - hunt-backward (repeat search backward)
  - _Ctrl-j Ctrl-l_ - goto-line
  
  __Font size commands:__
  
  - _Ctrl-j Ctrl-+_ - increase font-size
  - _Ctrl-j Ctrl--_ - decrease font-size
   

## EXAMPLE


```{.emf}
  jeany-bindings
  jeany-osd
```

## NOTES


  __jeany-bindings__  and the osd macros __jeany-osd__ and __jeany-osd-undo__ 
  are macros  defined in  `jeany.emf`.  The osd macros are only  available  if
  __jeany-bindings__ was called before by the user.
  
  In case you have trouble using  Ctrl-Space to start your text  selection you
  can, for a more conventional  region selection use i the user-setup the
  "Start-Up" option "MS Shift region" to begin your text selection.

## DESCRIPTION


  The git and sub-commands provide MicroEmacs with an interface to __git(1)__.
  __Git__ is a distributed version control system; using it, you can record the history of
  your source file modifications. Git is licensed under the GNU General
  Public License 2.0 and is freely available on the Internet, see the
  documentation provided with Git for more information on its features and
  use.

  The MicroEmacs __git__ command opens a little file viewer in *files' buffer with an
  including additional columns showing the Git state.

  The __git-add__ command adds the current buffers file to the repository. Note
  that this command only performs the local addition, a _git-commit_ is
  required to make the addition permanent.

  The  __git-branch__  command shows the current branch you are working on and
  lists all available branches on the message line. To checkout/switch to an other
  branch use _git-checkout_.

  The __git-checkout__ command checks out a git branch from the repository into the
  current directory if there is more than one branch available. 
  The user specifies the branch on the message line with TAB completion.
  Please note that this might lead to open files which does not exists in the current
  branch or files with a different content. 
  If you continue to edit these files you get the message that the file is changed. 
  Usually you will close non-existing files without saving them and use _reread-file_
  or _reread-all_ to update your editor.

  The __git-commit__ command commits any changes made to the currently buffer's
  file (including additions) to the repository. The user is prompted for a
  commit log message.

  The __git-diff__ command opens a _*git-diff*_ window displaying the differences
  between the current buffer's local file and repository version. If the
  current buffer is a directory list it will list all the differences found
  in all files within the directory.

  The __git-grep__ command opens a _*git-grep*_ window after prompting the user for
  a text string which can be as well a regular expressions and searches the files
  in the repository for the given text string. The results can be picked with the 
  mouse to jump to the given position in the file with the matching string.
  
  The __git-log__ command opens a _*git-log*_ window displaying the Git log of the
  current buffer's file.

  The __git-mv__ command allows to rename the current buffer file to a new
  repository file. The removal of the old filename is done automatically via
  a commit message.

  The __git-rm__ command removes the current buffer's file from the
  repository - PLEASE NOTE THIS CAN LEAD TO LOST DATA!!! This command only
  performs the local removal; as it deletes the buffer and file the
  __git-commit__ command cannot be used to commit the removal to the git
  repository. Instead the  __git(1)__ application itself must  be used.

  The __git-pull__ command updates all files in the current directory, the
  output being reported to a new _*git-pull*_ window. Note that unlike most
  git sub commands this command executes over all files in the current
  buffer's file directory.

  The __git-state__ command opens a _*git-state*_ window listing the state of any
  file in the current directory which is not up-to-date. Note that unlike
  most git sub commands this command executes over all files in the current
  buffer's file directory.

  The __git-status__ command opens a _*git-state*_ window and shows the state of
  the current buffer in the window including the modification state,
  repository etc.

  The __git-tag__  command  displays either all existing tags or allows you to
  enter a new tag name if a numerical argument of 1 is given by asking for the
  tag name and a message.

! 3 xrdb-scheme
## NAME


|xrdb-scheme
  xrdb-scheme - load xrdb color scheme files into MicroEmacs
$a
  
## SYNOPSIS

  __xrdb-scheme__ ["theme-name"]
   
## DESCRIPTION
   
  Loads X11-themes stored in xrdb files from the folder `themes` in the
  users config  folder  usually  `~/.jasspa`  or  `~/.config/jasspa`  into the
  running editor session. Themes in xrdb format are available from 
  https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/tree/master/xrdb
  The files needs to be saved as `THEME-NAME.xrdb` in the `themes` folder.
  If the users executed the `xrdb-scheme` command without a theme name as 
  argument an interactive menu is presented which show all available menues in
  the themes folder. So a typical themes folder might look like this;

        $ ls ~/.jasspa/themes/*.xrdb
        /home/username/.jasspa/themes/3024-day.xrdb         
        /home/username/.jasspa/themes/3024-night.xrdb
        /home/username/.jasspa/themes/belafonte-day.xrdb 
        /home/username/.jasspa/themes/belafonte-night.xrdb
        /home/username/.jasspa/themes/django.xrdb         
        /home/username/.jasspa/themes/dracula-plus.xrdb   
        /home/username/.jasspa/themes/floraverse.xrdb     
        /home/username/.jasspa/themes/material-dark.xrdb  
        /home/username/.jasspa/themes/material-light.xrdb

 
## NOTES

  __xrdb-scheme__ is defined in file `xrdb.emf`. Please note that
  the colors in a xrdb file can't be changed in the [scheme-editor(3)](scheme-editor(3)).
  To change the colors for a xrdb scheme you have to edit the xrdb 
  file directly. Here is an example on how you can install a theme 
  into your users ME configuation folder:
  
       mkdir ~/.jasspa/themes
       wget -O ~/.jasspa/themes/mathias.xrdb \
         https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/raw/master/xrdb/Mathias.xrdb
       wget -O  ~/.jasspa/themes/material-light.xrdb \
         https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/raw/master/xrdb/Material.xrdb
       wget -O  ~/.jasspa/themes/material-dark.xrdb \
         https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/raw/master/xrdb/Material%20Dark.xrdb
  
  After you executed these commands you should be able to use the downloaded
  themes after executing: `Esc x` and `xrdb-scheme` and then pressing two
  times the TAB key.

## NAME

|r-doc
  r-doc - display documentation for R functions and packages
|r-exec
  r-doc - execute the current R script using the Rscript interpreter
|r-format
  r-format - format a R script using the formatR library
|r-lint

$a
  
## SYNOPSIS

  __r-doc__ ["package::function|function"]
  _n_ __r-exec__  
  __r-format__  
  __r-lint__    

   
## DESCRIPTION
   
  The __r-doc__ macro displays in a hypertext browser with R syntax hilighting
  the manual pages for R packages or R functions.

  You can fold or unfold the section and use the  [item-list(3)](item-list(3))
  command  to  navigate  the  documentation  sections.  If no argment is given
  requests  a package or  function  name from the user via the  command  line.
  Package    overview   pages   should   be   requested   using   the   syntax
  "package::pkgname", documentation for specific functions should be requested
  using the syntax  "pkgname::funcname".  Links to other  functions and to the
  main package  overview are shown with hilights in the normal text. Usage and
  Examples sections use R highlighting.
  
  The __r-exec__  macro executes the currently edited R script file using the
  Rscript interpreter. It uses the current selected character encoding as 
  an argument for the Rscript interpreter to avoid error messages due to 
  wrong characters. If a numeric argument is given the user is asked for possible
  command line arguments.

  The __r-format__  macro formats the currently edited R script file using the
  formats the currently  edited file using the R library  `formatR` which must
  be    installed    by   the   user   for    instance    using    the   usual
  `install.packages('formatR')` syntax from within a R console.
  
  The __r-lint__   macro checks the currently edited file using the R package
  `lintr` which must be installed by the user for instance using the usual 
  `install.packages('lintr)` syntax from within a R console. 

  After executing the macro a popup-window (`*lintr*`) displays the warning
  messages of the linter package, the user can click on the hilighted lines
  showing  warnings and jump directly to the problematic line. The same can
  be achieved by pressing the ENTER key on the hilighted line.

## EXAMPLE
       
```{.emf}
       r-doc                    ; requests a help page from the user 
       r-doc "plot"             ; plot function documentation
       r-doc "cluster::pam"     ; function pam in package cluster docu
       r-doc "package::cluster" ; package overview with functions
       r-exec                   ; calls Rscript in the current R file
       0 r-exec                 ; ask for command line arguments and calls then Rscript
       r-format                 ; formats and reloads the currently edited R script
       r-lint                   ; gives code advise for the currently edited  R script 
```

  __r-doc__  macro is defined in file  `hkrdoc.emf`.  The macros __r-exec__,  __r-format__
  and __r-lint__ are implemented in the file `rtools.emf`.

  __py-lint__       
  set-variable _.py-lint.lint_ "_string_"  
  
   
## DESCRIPTION
   
  The __py-doc__ macro displays the manual page for a Python package module or
  package within MicroEmacs.

  You can fold or unfold the section and use the [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command 
  to get an overview about section and classes in a module or package.
  If no argument is given requests a package or function name from the
  user is requested via the message line.
  
  The __py-format__ macro formats the currently edited file using one of the
  Python formatters either `yapf` or `black`. You can usually install these 
  application using your systems package manager or using the pip package 
  manager. To set your formatter to "black" even if you have "yapf" installed,
  you can change the value of the variable _.py-format.format_ to "black". 

  The __py-lint__ macro checks the currently edited file using the Python
  package tool `pylint` which must be installed by the user for instance using
  the standard package manager or using the Python package manager pip like
  this: 

        pip install pylint --user

  After executing the macro __py-lint__ a popup-window (`*pylint*`) displays the
  warning messages of the `pylint` program, the user can click on the hilighted 
  lines showing warnings and jump directly to the problematic line. The same
  can be achieved by pressing th ENTER key on the highlighted line using
  the keyboard navigating to the warning or error line and pressing the ENTER key.

  Setting the variable _.py-lint.lint_ allows you to customize the linter
  settings.

  The __py-exec__ macro executed the currently edited file using the python3
  command line interpreter. If any numeric argument is given before calling
  the script, then the user is asked for command line arguments which should
  be given on the message line.

  After executing the macro a popup-window (`*pyexec*`) displays the results
  of the script execution. The user can click on the hilighted lines showing
  warnings and jump directly to the problematic line in the source script. The
  same can be achieved by pressing the ENTER key on the highlighted line using
  the keyboard.

## EXAMPLES

```{.emf}
     py-doc "argparse"      ; load the documentation of argparse module
     py-doc "sys"
     py-format              ; formats the current Python file using yapf (or black)
     set-variable .py-format.format "black"
```      

  Here an example to lint the currently edited Python script.

```{.emf}
    ; by modifying the macro variable .py-lint.lint
    ; you can add no  standard options to pylint like here
    set-variable .py-lint.lint "pylint  --docstring-min-length 20 %s"
    ; during editing a Python file press Esc x and then execute
    py-lint
```

## NOTES

  The __py-doc__, __py-exec__, __py-format__ and __py-lint__ macros are defined in the
  file `pytools.emf`.

## DESCRIPTION
   
  The __tcl-format__ macro formats the currently edited file using one the
  Tcl formatter `tclfmt` which is a Python script which you can install usually
   using the pip3 package manager with `pip3 install tclint --user`. This package
  contains  the command  line  applications  `tclint` and `tclfmt`. To set the
  options  for  the  formatter,  you can  change  the  value  of the  variable
  _%tcl-format-opts_  for instance like this: 
  
        set-variable %tcl-format-opts "tclfmt --spaces-in-braces %s"

  The __tcl-lint__ macro checks the currently edited file using the Python
  package  tool `tclint`  which must be installed by the user using the Python
  package manager  pip like  this: 

        pip3 install tclint --user

  After executing the macro __tcl-lint__ a popup-window (`*tcl-lint*`) displays the
  warning messages of the `tclint` program, the user can click on the hilighted 
  lines showing warnings and jump directly to the problematic line. The same
  can be achieved by pressing th ENTER key on the highlighted line using
  the keyboard navigating to the warning or error line and pressing the ENTER key.

  Setting the variable _%tcl-lint-opts_ allows you to customize the linter
  settings.

  The __tcl-exec__ macro executed the currently edited file using the tclsh
  command line interpreter. Before the script is executed [save-some-buffers](save-some-buffers(2))
  is executed to allow the user to ensure that all relevant buffers are saved.
  If bit  `0x01`  of the  numeric  argument  _n_ is  clear  then all  modified
  buffers are automatically saved, when set (the default) the user is prompted for
  each  buffer. If bit `0x02` of the numeric  argument is clear (the  default)
  the user is prompted for any additional  _command-line-arguments_  which are
  passed to the Tcl command. The arguments given are stored in a buffer variable,
  __:tcl-exec-args__, and used as the default arguments next time the script is executed.
  
  After  executing the script, a `*tcl-exec*`  buffer is opened with the output
  of the script execution.If any numeric argument is given before calling
  the script, then the user is asked for command line arguments which should
  be given on the message line.

  After executing the macro a popup-window (`*tcl-exec*`) displays the results
  of the script  execution. The user can click on the hilighted  lines showing
  warnings and errors and jump directly to the problematic  line in the source
  script.  The  same  can  be  achieved  by  pressing  the  ENTER  key  on the
  highlighted line using the keyboard.

## EXAMPLES

```{.emf}
     tcl-format              ; formats the current Tcl file using tclfmt
     set-variable %tcl-format-opts "tclfmt --spaces-in-braces %s"
```      

  Here an example to lint the currently edited Tcl script.

```{.emf}
    ; by modifying the macro variable %tcl-lint-opts
    ; you can add no  standard options to tclint like here
    set-variable %tcl-lint-opts "tclint  --style-line-length 120 %s"
    ; during editing a Tcl file press Esc x and then execute
    tcl-lint
```

## DESCRIPTION
   
  The __go-format__ macro formats the currently edited file using the
  default formatter `go fmt` You can  change  the  value  of the  variable
  _%go-format-opts_  for instance like this: 
  
        __set-variable__ _%go-format-opts_ "_go fmt -r '(a) -> a' -w  %s_"

  The __go-lint__ macro checks the currently edited file using the standard
  command `go vet`.

  After executing the macro __go-lint__ a popup-window (`*go-lint*`) displays the
  warning messages of the `go vet` program, the user can click on the hilighted 
  lines showing warnings and jump directly to the problematic line. The same
  can be achieved by pressing th ENTER key on the highlighted line using
  the keyboard navigating to the warning or error line and pressing the ENTER key.

  Setting the variable _%go-lint-opts_ allows you to customize the linter
  settings. similar to the `go fmt` settings shown above.

  The __go-exec__ macro executed the currently edited file using the `go run`
  call for that file. Before the script is executed [save-some-buffers](save-some-buffers(2))
  is executed to allow the user to ensure that all relevant buffers are saved.
  If bit  `0x01`  of the  numeric  argument  _n_ is  clear  then all  modified
  buffers are automatically saved, when set (the default) the user is prompted for
  each  buffer. If bit `0x02` of the numeric  argument is clear (the  default)
  the user is prompted for any additional  _command-line-arguments_  which are
  passed to the Go application. The arguments given are stored in a buffer variable,
  __:go-exec-args__, and used as the default arguments next time the script is executed.
  
  After executing the macro a popup-window (`*go-exec*`) displays the results
  of the script  execution. The user can click on the hilighted  lines showing
  warnings and errors and jump directly to the problematic  line in the source
  script.  The  same  can  be  achieved  by  pressing  the  ENTER  key  on the
  highlighted line using the keyboard.

## EXAMPLES

## SYNOPSIS

  _n_ __file-exec__  
  __file-format__  
  __file-lint__    

   
## DESCRIPTION
   
  The three commands described below require the definition of global variables 
  which should declare the command lines to be used for executing, linting or 
  formatting the current file. The variable names are of type:
  
  _%fhook-FHOOK-(exec|format|lint)_ 
  
  where _FHOOK_ is the file hook name of the file. The variable declaration
  can be added to the users configuration file, _USERNAME.emf_ or into the
  _myFHOOK.emf_ file within the users configuration folder. These variables
  should point to the tool or compiler or interpreter and take place holders
  for the filename or the file buffer basename like this:

  - "%f" - the filename of the currently edited file  
  - "%b" - the basename of the current file, so the name without the extension and
           the directory part
  
  For more usable abbreviations see the help page of the  [file-tool-setup(3)](file-tool-setup(3))
  macro.

  The variable _%fhook-FHOOK-format_ can take as well the value "restyle-buffer",
  so that the macro [restyle-buffer(3)](restyle-buffer(3)] is executed for the current 
  buffer. This is useful if there is no sophisticated formatting tool is 
  available for the programming language. See below for an example using the
  Freebasic compiler for linting and executing and ME for formatting.
    
  See below for a few examples to declare some variables.
  
  The __file-exec__  macro executes or compiles the currently edited file using 
  a global variable which needs to be defined for the current file hook. See below
  for a few examples for defining these global variables. If a numeric argument
  is given the user is asked for possible command line arguments. After executing 
  this macro a popup-window command should appear showing the output or possible 
  errors of the code.

  The __file-format__ macro formats the currently edited  file using the
  a language specific formatter which needs to be defined using an user defined
  global file hook dependent variable. See below for a few examples.
  
  The __file-lint__   macro checks the currently edited file using an user an user
  defined global variable for the current file hook.

  After executing the macro a popup-window (`*file-lint*`) displays the
  warning messages of the linter, the user can click on the hilighted lines
  showing warnings and that way jumping directly to the problematic line. This
  requires that the linter defined in the variable supports the
  _^FILENAME:LINE:CHAR_ syntax. The same can jumping to the error be achieved
  by pressing the ENTER key on the hilighted line.
  
  These three macros can be seen as simplified  versions for the Go, Python, R
  and Tcl macros like  __go-lint__,  __go-format__,  __go-exec__.  They can be
  used as well to use  alternative  tools for  formatting  and linting as well
  allow easy support of other  programming  languages for linting,  formatting
  and running the currently edited file.

## EXAMPLE
       
```{.emf}
       ; user-defined variables in the users emf or in the mypython.emf 
       set-variable %fhook-python-format "ruff format %f" ; using the ruff formatter
       set-variable %fhook-python-lint   "ruff check %f"  ; using the ruff linter
       set-variable %fhook-python-exec   "python3 %f"
       ; for the Go programming language it could be as well within username.emf or mygo.emf
       set-variable %fhook-go-format     "go fmt %f"
       set-variable %fhook-go-lint       "go vet %f"
       set-variable %fhook-go-exec       "go run %f"
       ; working with C++ code using clang-tidy, astyle and g++
       set-variable %fhook-cpp-lint "clang-tidy %f -- -std=c++17"
       ; set-variable %fhook-cpp-lint "cppcheck --quiet --enable=all --suppress=missingIncludeSystem %f"
       set-variable %fhook-cpp-exec "g++ -Wall -std=c++17 %f 2>&1 && ./a.out"
       ; working with C code using clang-tidy, astyle and gcc
       set-variable %fhook-c-lint "clang-tidy %f -- -std=c99"
       set-variable %fhook-c-exec "gcc -Wall -std=c99 %f 2>&1 && ./a.out"
       set-variable %fhook-c-format "astyle --indent=spaces=4 %f"
       ; freebasic declarations within hkvb.emf
       set-variable %fhook-vb-lint   "fbc -c -b %f"
       set-variable %fhook-vb-format "restyle-buffer"
       set-variable %fhook-vb-exec   "fbc -b %f -x %b && ./%b"
       ; command execution
       file-exec          ; executes the current file using the fhook-FHOOKNAME-exec var
       0 file-exec        ; ask for command line arguments and calls then executes
       file-format        ; formats and reloads the currently edited file using the formatter
       file-lint          ; gives code advise for the currently edited file
```

## NAME


  user-setup - Configure MicroEmacs for a specific user
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __user-setup__


## DESCRIPTION


  __user-setup__ provides a dialog interface to enable the user to configure the
  editor. __user-setup__ may be invoked from the main _Help_ menu or directly from
  the command line using [execute-named-command(2)](execute-named-command(2)). __user-setup__ configures the
  user's setup registry file, "_<logname>_`.erf`" which is used by MicroEmacs to
  initialize the environment to a user's preference.

  Note, if your screen is too small to display the whole dialog, it may be
  moved using any key bound to the scroll commands such as __scroll-up__, e.g.
  `A-up`, `C-z`, `A-down`, `C-v`, `A-left` etc. For systems without mouse support, the
  `tab` key may be used to move between fields.

  On all pages the following buttons are available at the bottom of the
  dialog and have the following effect:

  `Save`
  
  >  Saves the changes made to the users registry file, i.e.
     "_<Log-Name>_`.erf`" but does not re-initialize MicroEmacs. Some changes,
     such as color scheme changes, only take effect when the __Current__ button
     is used or when MicroEmacs is restarted.

  `Current`
  
  >  Makes the current user and the changes made Current to this MicroEmacs
     session, dismissing the __user-setup__ dialog and reinitializing
     MicroEmacs. This also saves the registry file out!

  `Cancel`
  
  >  Quits __user-setup__, if changes where not __Save__d or made __Current__ they will
     be lost.

  The following pages, which appear in the dialog, are defined as follows:-


## Start-up 


  `User Name`
  
  >  Documents the user name currently being configured, this entry cannot
     be changed in user-setup, see [$user-name(5)]($user-name(5)) for help on changing the
     MicroEmacs user name.

  `User Path`
  
  >  Documents the location of the current user's MicroEmacs setup files,
     this entry cannot be changed in user-setup, see [$user-path(5)]($user-path(5)) for help
     on changing the user path.

  `Setup File`
  
  >  Sets the personal user setup macro file name which is executed at
     start-up. A user macro file should contain all personal settings such
     as preferred key bindings etc. See [Setting Up A User Profile](UserProfiles(2)) for more
     information. The __Edit__ check box can be used to enable/disable the
     automatic loading of the setup file ready for editing when the __Current__
     button is used.

  `Company File`
  
  >  Sets the company setup macro file name which is executed at start-up.
     A company macro file should contain all company wide standard settings
     such as `%company-name`, No `.emf` extension is supplied. 
     See [Company Profile](CompanyProfiles(2)) for more information.

  `Emulation`
  
  >  Sets an emulation mode which changes the behaviour on MicroEmacs to
     emulate another editor/program; this is done by executing a macro file
     at start-up. An emulation macro file should contain the macro code
     required to simulate the environment of the other editor. MicroEmacs
     2009 is released with four emulation modes, GNU Emacs (see macro file
     `meemacs.emf`), CUA (Windows style key bindings and interface, see
     `mecua.emf`), MicroEmacs v3.8 (`meme3_8.emf`) and NEdit v5 which is at
     best a demonstration of what can be achieved via the emulation support
     (defined in `menedit.emf`). See [Compatibility](Compatibility(2)) for more information on
     emulation.

  >  In case you  change  the  keyboard  mapping  you  should in most cases
     restart the editor to avoid possible problems. Since 2023 the CUA
     emulation seems to work reasonable well. But if you switch back to 
     no-emulation mode you have to restart the editor.

  `Rebind Home Keys`
  
  >  When enabled the following key bindings are created to ease
     frustration, particularly for MS users:

  > >  `home` -
            Bound to beginning-of-line instead of beginning-of-buffer.

  > >   `end` -
            Bound to end-of-line instead of end-of-buffer.

  > >  `C-home` -
            Bound to beginning-of-buffer.

  > >  `C-end` -
            Bound to end-of-buffer.

  `MS Shift Region`
  
  >  Enables/disables cursor key manipulation with the shift key similar to
     the conventional Microsoft region selection. When enabled, pressing
     the shift key in conjunction with the cursor movement keys selects a
     region which is hilighted. Once the region is selected then the
     `<DELETE>` or `<BACKSPACE>` key erases the selected region. This also
     enables a similar behaviour with the Mouse __Drag region__ driver, see
     below.


## Locale Setup 


  `Keyboard`
  
  >  Configures MicroEmacs to the user's keyboard. Accent character
     generation keys present on foreign keyboards cannot be automatically
     supported on Windows platforms. MicroEmacs must be informed of the
     keyboard being used to correctly interpret the keys. If a required
     keyboard is not supported please see [FAQ38](faq38(0f)) on how to setup the
     keyboard, also see [Locale Support](localeSupport(2)).

  `Language`
  
  >  Sets the user language, this sets the word (or letter) characters and
     if available sets up [spell(2)](spell(2)) with appropriate spelling rules and
     dictionaries. For more information on adding support for a language
     see [Locale Support](localeSupport(2)).

  __NOTES__
  
  >  Earlier versions MicroEmacs had "`(Ext)`" languages which use extended
     language dictionaries, vastly increasing the word list. New versions
     automatically test for and use these dictionaries if available.

  >  In earlier versions a personal dictionary name could be set in the
     next field, this option was removed on Oct 2001. Instead a personal
     dictionary for each language is automatically created for you, any
     words or auto-corrected words will be added to the current languages
     personal dictionary. The name of dictionary is "`lsdp`_<lang-id>_`.edf`"
     where "_<lang-id>_" is the 4 letter MicroEmacs language name (e.g.
     "`enus`" for American), simply rename any existing personal dictionary
     to this new name.

  `Auto Save Dictionaries`
  
  >  Enables auto-saving of any changed dictionaries on exit. If this is
     disabled the user is prompted to save for each changed dictionary.

  `Enable Auto-Spell`
  
  >  Enables Auto Spell Checking in file types which support this feature
     (usually text based files such as [txt(9)](txt(9)) or [nroff(9)](nroff(9)) files etc). Auto
     spell detects word breaks as you type and checks the spelling of every
     completed word hilighting any erroneous words in the error color
     scheme (usually red). When auto-spell is enable, right clicking on an
     erroneous word will add an extra __Auto Spell__ sub-menu to the opened
     context menu, the sub-menu lists suggested corrections and other
     useful options; this menu can also be opened by executing the
     [auto-spell-menu(3)](auto-spell-menu(3)) command (usually bound to "C-f7"). The feature can
     be manually enabled and disabled by invoking the [auto-spell(3)](auto-spell(3))
     command.


## General 


  `Full Name`
  
  >  This should be set to the user's name and is used in a variety of
     places, e.g. by [etfinsrt(3)](etfinsrt(3)) to set the "Created By" field in a
     template.

  `Organizer File`
  
  >  Sets the organizer file base name, defaults to the __Log Name__. When
     notes and addresses are stored using [organizer(3)](organizer(3)) the file
     "_<Organizer>_`.eof`" is used.

  `Global Modes`
  
  >  Sets the initial state of the global [quiet(5)]($quiet(5)) global variable.

  `Search Modes`
  
  >  Sets the initial state of the global search modes [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) and
     [magic(2m)](magic(2m)). This indirectly executes [global-mode(2)](global-mode(2)) to set the required
     modes.

  `Buffer Modes`
  
  >  Sets the initial state of the global modes [auto(2m)](auto(2m)), [backup(2m)](backup(2m)),
     [tab(2m)](tab(2m)) and [undo(2m)](undo(2m)), any buffers created will inherit the state of
     these modes. However, as changing these modes directly effects only
     the global modes, any existing buffers (including ones re-created
     using the `-c` command-line option, see [me(1)](me(1))) will not be effect by the
     setting of these modes. For them to take effect, the buffers should be
     reloaded. These modes can be changed on a per file type basis using
     the command [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)), also some file hooks override these
     global settings, such as the [makefile(9)](makefile(9)) hook which overrides the __tab__
     mode. This indirectly executes [global-mode(2)](global-mode(2)) to set the required
     modes.

  `Auto-Save Time`
  
  >  Sets the length of time in seconds between buffer auto-saves, a
     setting of `0` or an empty string disables auto-saving. The default
     setting is 300 seconds or 5 minutes. This indirectly sets the
     [auto-time(5)]($auto-time(5)) variable and the [autosv(2m)](autosv(2m)) global mode.

  `Keep Undo`
  
  >  If this is enabled the [undo](undo(2)) history is kept after a save allowing the
     [undo(2)](undo(2)) command to back-up changes beyond the last save. When clear
     the undo history is discarded after the buffer is saved. This
     indirectly sets bit 0x8000 of the [$system(5)]($system(5)) variable.

  `Hide Backups`
  
  >  Enables hiding MicroEmacs generated backup files. On Windows and Dos
     platforms the Hidden file attribute is used to hide the file, whereas
     on UNIX the backup file name is prepended with a '`.`'. This indirectly
     sets bit 0x100000 of the [$system(5)]($system(5)) variable.

  `Main Menu - Enable`
  
  >  Enables the top main menu bar.

  `F-Type Buffer Sel`
  
  >  When enabled the main __File__ menu's __Buffer__ selection sub-menu changes
     from being a simple complete list of buffers to being a list of File
     Types (as defined by the __File Types__ section below). Selecting one of
     these file types opens a further sub-menu listing all buffers of this
     type; this option is useful when the current session of MicroEmacs has
     a large number of buffers.

  `Alt Action - Esc Prfx`
  
  >  If enabled the Alt key acts as a [prefix 1](prefix(2)) modifier key when no direct
     binding exists. By default '`A-n`' is not bound, with this bit set the
     key is inferred to '`esc n`' which is bound to __forward-paragraph__. Note
     that global, local and menu hot-key bindings override these. This
     indirectly sets bit 0x4000 of the [$system(5)]($system(5)) variable.

  `Alt Action - Main Menu Hot-keys`
  
  >  If enabled the main menu Alt hot-key bindings are enabled. These are
     dynamic bindings automatically generated from the main menu. Typically
     the first item in the main menu is "`File`" with a hot key of '__F__', with
     this enabled '`A-f`' will open this menu item. Note that global and
     local key bindings override these. This indirectly sets bit 0x2000 of
     the [$system(5)]($system(5)) variable.

  `Abbrev Setup`
  
  >  Configures which abbreviation expansion methods are enabled by default
     when the [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3)) is executed. __Accent__ enables
     [expand-iso-accents(3)](expand-iso-accents(3)), Lookback enables [expand-look-back(3)](expand-look-back(3)) and Dict'n
     enables [expand-word(3)](expand-word(3)).

  `Tab To Indent`
  
  >  Sets the [tab(2)](tab(2)) behavior in a buffer which has an [indentation](indent(2)) method.
     This indirectly sets bits `0x1000` and `0x200000` of the [$system(5)]($system(5))
     variable.

  `Show Modes`
  
  >  Selects which modes are to be displayed on the mode-line whenever a
     "`%e`" token is used in the [$mode-line(5)]($mode-line(5)) variable. This indirectly sets
     the [$show-modes(5)]($show-modes(5)) variable.


## Platform - UNIX Setup 


  Only present on UNIX platforms using the X interface, see below for the
  Console setup.

  `Font`
  
  >  Sets the X font name to be used. This indirectly executes
     [change-font(2)](change-font(2)) with the given font name. e.g.
 
  >  `"-*-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-*-*-*-c-90-*"`

  `Display Char Set`
  
  >  Selects the display character set being used by the system to render
     the MicroEmacs window, dependent on the __Font__ being used. The setting
     of this option effects the configuration of MicroEmacs's internal
     character maps (using command [set-char-mask(2)](set-char-mask(2))) enabling the character
     sets of foreign languages to be correctly supported. It also changes
     the definition of variables [$box-chars(5)]($box-chars(5)) and [$window-chars(5)]($window-chars(5)) to
     their best values for the given font.

  `Extend Char Set`
  
  >  When enabled MicroEmacs replaces the display of characters `0x00` to
     `0x1f` with forms which are useful for variables [$box-chars(5)]($box-chars(5)) and
     [$window-chars(5)]($window-chars(5)) greatly improving the look of [osd(2)](osd(2)) dialogs, the
     scroll bars etc.

  `Use Fonts`
  
  >  When enabled the bold, italic, light and underline characteristics of
     the font will be used depending on their availability and the Color
     Scheme being used. This indirectly sets bit `0x10` of the [$system(5)]($system(5))
     variable.

  `Draw White Spaces`
  
  >  Enables the drawing of visible white spaces, i.e. space, tab and
     new-line characters. This indirectly sets bit `0x80000` of the
     [$system(5)]($system(5)) variable.

  `Enable Toolbar`
  
  >  Enables the Toolbar - configurable, managed windows giving easy access
     to many features and tools. When enabled the toolbar is opened and
     displayed at start-up, when disabled the toolbar is not displayed but
     it can be opened (or closed) by simply executing the [toolbar(3)](toolbar(3))
     command.

  `Client Server`
  
  >  The client/server enables the file based external macro command driver
     to be enabled - see [Client-Server](Client-Server(2)). This by default is disabled, when
     enabled it is used by [command-line](me(1)) options __-m__ and __-o__.

  `DOS File Names`
  
  >  DOS has a restricted 8.3 file naming system (i.e. "`BBBBBBBB.XXX`"), if
     this option is enabled the MicroEmacs 2009 will adhere to this system
     for auto-save and backup file names whenever possible. See
     [$auto-time(5)]($auto-time(5)) for more information on the naming convention used. This
     indirectly sets bit 0x400 of the [$system(5)]($system(5)) variable.

  `# Backups`
  
  >  This option only has an effect when __DOS File Names__ is disabled.
     Setting this to a number greater than zero enables multiple backup
     files to be created, the number determined by this value. If set to
     zero (or less) then only a single backup file is created. This
     indirectly sets the [$kept-versions(5)]($kept-versions(5)) variable.

  `Ignore Files`
  
  >  Sets a list extensions of files to be ignored in file completion, e.g.
     MicroEmacs backup files (`~`). This indirectly sets the [$file-ignore(5)]($file-ignore(5))
     variable.

  `Cursor Blink Rate`
  
  >  Sets the cursor blink period in millisecond. The first entry box sets
     the cursor visible time, a setting of zero disables blinking. The
     second box sets the hidden time. A visible time of 600 and hidden time
     of 200 gives a reasonable blink cycle. This indirectly sets the
    [$cursor-blink(5)]($cursor-blink(5)) variable.

  `Fence Display`
  
  >  Sets the preferred method of displaying a matching fence, a fence is
     one of the following brackets:

         {...}   (...)   [...]


  >  Jumping to the opening fence only occurs when the closing brace is
     typed, whereas the drawing of matching fences occurs whenever the
     cursor is on an open fence or one character past the close fence. When
     this option is set to "`Never Display`" the [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)) setting is
     ignored.

  `Scroll Bars`
  
  >  Selects the scroll bar support required. When Splitter is enabled, the
     first character of the scroll bar and mode-line is a split character
     used for splitting the window into two using the mouse. This
     indirectly sets the [$scroll-bar(5)]($scroll-bar(5)) variable.

  `Horizontal Scroll`
  
  >  Selects the horizontal scrolling method used with the [scroll-left(2)](scroll-left(2))
     and [scroll-right(2)](scroll-right(2)) commands. This indirectly sets the [$scroll(5)]($scroll(5))
     variable.

  `Vertical Scroll`
  
  >  Selects the vertical scrolling method used with the [forward-line(2)](forward-line(2))
     and [backward-line(2)](backward-line(2)) commands. This indirectly sets the [$scroll(5)]($scroll(5))
     variable.

  `Color Scheme`
  
  >  Sets the color scheme setup macro file name which is executed at
     start-up. MicroEmacs by default comes with 4 color schemes. Color
     schemes can be created and altered using the [scheme-editor(3)](scheme-editor(3)) dialog.


## Platform - UNIX Console Setup 


  Only present on UNIX platforms when using the termcap interface, all the
  Console platform settings are kept independent of the X interface
  settings.

  `Display Char Set`
  
  >  See __Platform UNIX Setup__ above.

  `Termcap Color`
  
  >  This option determines whether Termcap based colors should be used.
     These are typically the standard eight colors and may not be supported
     on all terminals. If this option is disabled Termcap fonts (such as
     bold) are used instead to create a primitive hi-lighting. This
     indirectly sets bit 0x004 of the [$system(5)]($system(5)) variable.

  `Use Fonts`
  
  >  See __Platform UNIX Setup__ above.

  `Draw White Spaces`
  
  >  See __Platform UNIX Setup__ above.

  `Color Scheme`
  
  >  See __Platform UNIX Setup__ above.


## Platform - Win32 Setup 


  Only present on Microsoft Windows based machines.

  `Font Name`
  
  >  Sets the windows font name and size. This indirectly executes
    [change-font(2)](change-font(2)) with the given font name. MicroEmacs may only use a
     Fixed Mono Font, either an OEM font as used by the MS-DOS command
     line, or the more conventional ANSI fonts. The fonts are selected
     using the __Change__ __Font__ button which invokes a dialog to allow the
     available fonts to be selected. True-Type mono fonts such as Courier
     New or `Lucida Console` are typically used.

  `Weight & Size`
  
  >  Allows the size and weight of the font to be selected, specified as
     _weight_, _width_ and _height_. The _weight_ is typically 4, this corresponds
     to a regular weighting, 7 is bold. _width_ is the width of the font in
     pixels, this may be 0 when the height is specified as negative. _height_
     is the height of the font, typically a negative value (where the _width_
     is 0), which produces a proportionally sized font, values of in the
     range -11 .. -14 generally produce reasonably sized fonts. The _hight_
     and _width_ may be specified as positive values and allow explicit font
     dimensions to be specified, generally used to achieve a precise font
     size requirement.

  `Fonts`
  
  >  See `Use Fonts` in __Platform UNIX Setup__ above.

  `Display Char Set`
  
  >  See __Platform UNIX Setup__ above.

  `Extend Char Set`
  
  >  See __Platform UNIX Setup__ above.

  `Choose Font`
  
  >  Opens a windows dialog allowing the user to select a font, the
     selection is used to configure the above font fields.

  `Draw White Spaces`
  
  >  See __Platform UNIX Setup__ above.

  `Capture Alt Space`
  
  >  Used to enable/disable the capture and interpretation of the '`A-space`'
     key sequence. If this key sequence is not captured by MicroEmacs it is
     passed back to Windows which opens the top left window menu, allow
     keyboard access to Window commands like Maximize.

  `Enable Toolbar`
  
  >  See __Platform UNIX Setup__ above.

  `Client Server`
  
  >  See __Platform UNIX Setup__ above. Note that on windows based systems the
     client/server is also used by [memsdev(1)](memsdev(1)) to drive the editor from the
     Microsoft Developer environment.

  `DOS File Names`
  
  >  See __Platform UNIX Setup__ above. Note that some early version of Windows
     '95 have problems with `~` extensions. Service release 2 fixed these
     problems - if you experience problems then return to 8.3 filename mode
     - note that MicroEmacs will still store longer file names, only the
     backup naming convention changes.

  `# Backups`
  
  >  See __Platform UNIX Setup__ above.

  `Ignore Files`
  
  >  See __Platform UNIX Setup__ above.

## Platform - DOS Setup 


  Only present on DOS machines.

  `Graphic Mode #` and `Double Lines`
  
  >  Sets the DOS graphics mode number and whether the number of text lines
     can be doubled. This indirectly executes [change-font(2)](change-font(2)) with the given
     font name.

  `Display Char Set`
  
  >  See __Platform UNIX Setup__ above.

  `Double Lines`
  
  >  In some graphic modes the number of text lines can be doubled via a
     dos terminal call, this option is worth trying if more visible text
     lines are required.

  `Draw White Spaces`
  
  >  See __Platform UNIX Setup__ above.

## Mouse 


  The mouse device creates keys in a similar way to regular keyboard keys
  and, like keyboard keysm they must be bound before they are used.
  MicroEmacs 2009 does not have the mouse functionality hard coded into the
  editor, it provides a macro interface to the mouse for ultimate
  flexibility and a set of default functionality which can be bound to the
  mouse in a variety of ways.

  All the mouse controlling macros are stored in `mouse.emf` and `mouseosd.emf`
  although some buffers have local functionality over-rides, such as
  [file-browser(3)](file-browser(3)). The user can expand the range of mouse functionality but
  how this is achieved is beyond the scope of this documentation.

  The __user-setup__ dialog allows the user to configure the mouse to use the
  default functionality, as follows:-

  `Enable Mouse`
  
  >  Enables or disables the mouse, when disabled the mouse can not be used
     and will not generate any key events. This does not apply to UNIX
     Termcap systems as the mouse cut and paste operation is performed by
     the Xterm. This indirectly sets bit 0x010 of the [$mouse(5)]($mouse(5)) variable.

  `Number Buttons`
  
  >  Sets the number of buttons on the mouse, may be 1, 2 or 3. MicroEmacs
     usually obtains the correct number for the system, but sometimes this
     can be wrong. This entry can be used to correct this problem. For one
     button mice, the button is considered to be the `left` mouse button, two
     button mice have an `left` and `right` button. This indirectly sets the
    [$mouse(5)]($mouse(5)) variable.

  `Swap Buttons`
  
  >  If enabled then the `left` and `right` buttons are swapped, i.e. when the
     left button is pressed it executes the right button bindings. This
     indirectly sets bit 0x020 of the [$mouse(5)]($mouse(5)) variable.

  `Simulate 3 Buttons`
  
  >  If enabled then pressing the `left` and `right` buttons together with
     generate a middle button press event, this feature is for people with
     a 2 button mouse who want more. The two buttons must be pressed or
     release within 10 millisecond of each other.

  The following four fields determine which mouse button binding the user
  wishes to view and change:-

  `Button`
  
  >  The mouse button, `Left`, `Right` or `Middle` for the normal buttons and
     `Whell Up` or `Whell Down` for the pilot wheel events.

  `Modifier - Shift`
  
  >  The action of the mouse can be different for every modifier key
     setting, if this is enabled then the binding being modified is for the
     __Button__ being pressed with the __Shift__ key held down.

  `Modifier - Control`
  
  >  If enabled then modifying the action when the __Button__ is pressed with
     the __Control__ key held down.

  `Modifier - Alt`
  
  >  If enabled then modifying the action when the __Button__ is pressed with
     the __Alt__ key held down.

  The following two fields determine the functionality of the button defined
  by the previous four fields:-

  `Bound To`
  
  >  The function to be performed. The functions available depend on the
     type of button being bound, the following is a list of functions
     available for normal buttons:-

  >  `<not bound>`
  
  > >   The Button is not bound.

  >  `Drag region`
  
  > >   [set-mark(2)](set-mark(2)) is called at the pick location, until the button is
        dropped, the area of text between this point and the current mouse
        position is hi-lighted. When the mouse button is dropped, if the
        drop position is the same as the pick then the double click is
        tested for, if a double click is entered then the Select Word
        function is executed, otherwise the cursor is simply moved to the
        drop position. If the pick and drop position are different then
        the enclosed text is copied to the kill buffer using
        [copy-region(2)](copy-region(2)). Note this behaviour is altered by the setting of
        MS Shift Region on the Start-Up page.

  >  `Copy Rectangle`
        One corner of a rectangle is defined on the pick and the
        diagonally opposite corner is defined when the button is dropped,
        the text enclosed within the rectangle is copied to the kill
        buffer using [copy-rectangle(3)](copy-rectangle(3)).

  >  `Kill Rectangle`
        The same as Copy Rectangle except the text is killed using
        [kill-rectangle(2)](kill-rectangle(2)).

  >  `Select Word`
        Also executed from a double click bound to Drag Region, Select
        Word copies the word under the mouse into the kill buffer using
        [copy-region(2)](copy-region(2)), unless a double click is entered in which case the
        whole line is copied.

  >  `Default Pan`
        While the mouse button is pressed the current buffer pans with any
        mouse movement.

  >  `MS Pan`
        MicroSoft style Pan; while the mouse button is pressed the current
        buffer pans vertically according to the mouse position relative to
        the point where the button was pressed.

  >  `Find Buffer`
        Opens a buffer selection dialog, the buffer selected is displayed
        in the window.

  >  `Find Tag`
        Executes [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2)) with the word currently under the mouse.

  >  `Find ME Help`
        Executes [help-item(2)](help-item(2)) with the word currently under the mouse.

  >  `Undo`
        Simply executes [undo(2)](undo(2)) without moving the cursor to the position
        of the mouse. Subsequent calls to this binding will undo multiple
        edits.

  >  `No Move Yank`
        Simply executes [yank(2)](yank(2)) without moving the cursor to the position
        of the mouse.

  >  `Replace Yank`
        Simplar to "No move yank" except when the is a current region
        (typically defined by "Drag region" above), in which case the
        region is first deleted.

  >  `Move to Yank`
        Moves the cursor to the current position of the mouse and executes
        [yank(2)](yank(2)).

  >  `Reyank`
        Executes [reyank(2)](reyank(2)) without moving the cursor. Note, to enable this
        functionality some sanity checks have had to be removed, as a
        result it should not be misused as seeming bizarre things can
        occur.

  >  `Rectangle Yank`
        Moves the cursor to the current position of the mouse and executes
        [yank-rectangle(2)](yank-rectangle(2)).

  >  `Collapse Current`
        Toggles the collapse status of the current block, only applicable
        in buffers supporting [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)), such as c and emf
        files.

  >  `Collapse All`
        Toggles the collapse status of the whole buffer, opening or
        closing all found blocks. Only applicable in buffers supporting
        [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)), such as c and emf files.

  >  `Main Menu`
        Simply opens the main menu from any where on the screen.

  >  `Context Menu`
        Opens a context sensitive menu dependent on the position of the
        mouse, i.e. opens the main menu if over it, opens a different menu
        when executed on the mode-line etc.

  >  The following is a list of functions available for pilot wheel
     events:-

  >  `Not bound`
  
  > >   The Button is not bound.

  >  `Scroll Up 1 Line` ....

  > >   Scrolls the current buffer by the specified amount.

  > `Handle Scroll Bars`
   
  > >   When enabled, if the button is pressed with the mouse on the main
        menu, a scroll bar or mode-line the standard action is performed, such
       as opening the main menu or scrolling up or down the window etc. The
       __bound To__ command is only called if the mouse is in a main window. If
       disabled, the __Bound To__ command is always called.

  `Defaults`
  
  >  Rests the mouse configuration to the default settings.


## File Types 


  The file type list is used in two places, the main menu's File => Quick
  Open sub-menu list and the `File => Open => File Type` list. In each case
  the file type "`All Files`" is automatically added. The user can add, remove
  and change the list of file types by using this dialog. An entry can be
  selected for editing or deletion by simply selecting it with the left
  mouse button. A new entry may be added by simply filling in the 3 entry
  boxes and selecting Add. Items in the Dialog are as follows.

  `No.`
  
  >  The file type entry number. A new entry is always added to the end of
     the list, ignoring this value. The position of an existing entry can
     be changed by altering this field to the desired position and
     selecting the `Change` button to move it to its new position.

  `Name`
  
  >  The file type name, the string printed in the sub-menus.

  `File Mask List`
  
  >  A comma ('`,`') separated list of file masks which match the file type,
     e.g. for C and C++ source files use "`*.c,*.cc,*.cpp`".

  `Add`
  
  >  Adds a new entry to the list, only the __Name__ and __FileMask List__ fields
     are used, the __No.__ field is ignored as the new entry is always added to
     the end of the list. The position can be altered by using the __Change__
     button.

  `Change`
  
  >  Alters an existing file type entry, all 3 fields must be set.

  `Delete`
  
  >  Deletes the current entry number, only the __No.__ entry is used.


## Tools 


  The Tools dialog allows the user to configure up to 10 system commands, or
  tools, which can be executed via MicroEmacs Main Tools Menu. The dialog
  configures the user's registry for the command [execute-tool(3)](execute-tool(3)) to be used.
  The execution of a tool can also be bound to a key, see __execute-tool__ for
  more information.

  The top half of the dialog consists of the 10 Tools (`0`-`9`) configuration
  buttons. Selecting one of these selects the current tool to be configured,
  the current tool is shown by the title in the middle of the dialog.

  The lower half of the dialog configures the currently selected tool, as
  follows:-

  `Tool Name`
  
  >  Sets the displayed name of the tool. The tool name is used in the
     buttons in the top half of this dialog and in the MicroEmacs Main
     Tools Menu.

  `Command Line`
  
  >  Sets the system command-line to be launched whenever the tool is
     executed, the following special tokens may be used in the command-line
     which are substituted at execution:-

  >  __%ff__
  
  > >    The current buffer's full file name, including the path.

  >  __%fp__
  
  > >    The current buffer's file path.

  >  __%fn__
   
  > >    The current buffer's file name without the path.

  >  __%fb__

  > >    The current buffer's file base name, i.e. the file name without
         the path or the extension.

  >  __%fe__

  > >    The current buffer's file extension with the '.' (e.g. ".emf"),
         set to the empty string if the file name does not have an
         extension.

  >  Note that "__%ff__" is always the same as "__%fp%fn__" and "__%fp%fb%fe__". If any
     of these tokens are used, the tool will fail to execute if the current
     buffer does not have a file name.

  `Run Concurrently`
  
  >  If enabled, when the tool is executed the command is launched and run
     concurrently, allowing the user to continue working in MicroEmacs
     during the tools execution. This option is not available for all
     versions on MicroEmacs and forces the output to be captured. Enabling
     this option will force the use of command [ipipe-shell-command(2)](ipipe-shell-command(2)) to
     launch the tool.

  `Capture Output`
  
  >  If enabled any output produced from the execution of the tool will be
     captured and inserted into a new buffer. When enabled the following
     two items, `Buffer` and `Hide`, may be specified. When disabled the
     command used to execute the tool is [shell-command(2)](shell-command(2)), otherwise the
     command used is either [pipe-shell-command(2)](pipe-shell-command(2)) or [ipipe-shell-command(2)](ipipe-shell-command(2))
     depending on the setting of `Run Concurrently`.

  `Buffer`
  
  >  Specifies the buffer name the captured output should be dumped to,
     this option is only visible when `Capture Output` is enabled. The
     following special tokens may be used in the buffer name which are
     substituted at execution:-

  >  __%fn__
  
  > >   The current buffer's file name without the path, set to the buffer
        name if the current buffer does not have a file name.

  >  __%fb__

  > >   The current buffer's file base name, i.e. the file name without
        the path or the extension. Set to the buffer name if the current
        buffer does not have a file name.

  >  __%fe__

  > >   The current buffer's file extension with the '.' (e.g. ".emf"),
        set to the empty string if the current buffer does not have a file
        name or it does not have an extension.

  >  Note that "__%fn__" is always the same as "__%fb%fe__". Default buffer name
     when this field is left empty is "_*command*_", or "_*icommand*_" if Run
     Concurrently is enabled.

  `Hide`
  
  >  When enabled the tool output capture buffer is hidden, this option is
     only visible when `Capture Output` is enabled.

  Current Buffer - `Save` and `Prompt Before Saving`
  
  >  If the current buffer has been edited, enabling `Save Current Buffer`
     will automatically save the current buffer before executing the tool.
     This is particularly useful when the tool operates on the current
     buffer's file (e.g. compiles the file). If `Prompt` is also enabled the
     user will be prompted before the file is saved.

  All Buffers - `Save` and `Prompt Before Saving`
  
  >  If `Save All Buffers` is enabled, all edited buffers will be
     automatically saved before executing the tool. This is particularly
     useful when the tool may operate on multiple files (e.g. compilation
     of a project). If `Prompt` is also enabled the user will be prompted
     before each file is saved.


## E-Mail 


  MicroEmacs 2009 provides a simple E-Mail manager, see [vm(3)](vm(3)) for more
  information and example entries. It must be stressed that __vm__ has only been
  tested in one environment, caution should be used as system differences
  may cause problems, such as loss of data, which the author does not except
  any responsibility for.

  The __E-Mail Setup__ dialog configures a user to use part or all of the __vm__
  E-Mail manager, as follows:-


## Platform ALL Mail Setup 


  The following field is used for both sending and receiving mail:

  `User Mail Dir`
  
  >  Sets the user mail-box directory where all files are to be found and
     stored (except usually the __Incoming Mail box__). The value of this field
     is platform independent and must be setup for each one.

  The following fields are used for sending mail:

  `Send Mail Signature`
  
  >  Sets the signature file name which is inserted at the bottom of every
     out-going email message, if empty the no signature is inserted. The
     value of this field is platform independent, is value use by all. The
     file must be located in the __User Mail Dir__ and no path entered for it
     to work across platforms.

  `Carbon-Copy File`
  
  >  Sets the sent-mail carbon-copy file, creating the "`Fcc:`" line of the
     mail buffer. All out-going emails are appended to the end of this file
     if the "`Fcc:`" line is not altered. If this field is left empty then no
     "`Fcc:`" line is created. The value of this field is platform
     independent, the file must be located in the __User Mail Dir__.

  `Insert Data (^C^I)`
  
  >  Sets the first embedded data command line, bound to "`C-c C-I`". The
     value of this field is platform dependent.

  `Insert Data (^C^Z)`
  
  >  Sets the second embedded data command line, bound to "`C-c C-z`". The
     value of this field is platform dependent.

  `Send Mail Command`
  
  >  Sets the command-line used for sending email messages. The value of
     this field is platform dependent.

  The following fields are used for receiving mail:

  `Check for mail`
  
  >  Sets the time interval between the automatic checking for incoming
     mail in seconds, when set to 0 the automatic checking is disabled.
     When enabled, the check is performed by [mail-check(3)](mail-check(3)) which also sends
     any queued mail and gets any new mail if the __Get Mail Command__ is used.
     The value of this field is platform dependent.

  `Get Mail Command`
  
  >  The command used to get new mail from the server, if empty it is
     assumed the __Incoming Mail Box__ is automatically updated by the system.
     If used the command must append new mail to the end of the Incoming
     Mail Box specified below. The value of this field is platform
     dependent.

  `Incoming Mail Box`
  
  >  Sets the incoming mail box file which new incoming mail is appended
     to, either automatically by the system or by the __Get Mail Command__. The
     value of this field is platform dependent.

  `VM Main In Box`
  
  >  Sets the main current mail box, or inbox. The value of this field is
     platform independent, the file must be located in the __User Mail Dir__.

  `VM Gets Mail`
  
  >  When enabled, executing the command vm will not only create the mail
     box windows, it will also get and process any new mail. When disabled
     only the vm '`g`' command can be used to get and process new mail.

  `Mime Data Extract`
  
  >  Sets the command-line used for extracting Mime encoded embedded data.
     The value of this field is platform dependent.

  `Uuencode Extract`
  
  >  Sets the command-line used for extracting Uuencoded embedded data. The
     value of this field is platform dependent.

  `Auto-Archive Setup`
  
  >  Sets up the auto-archive of messages in the current inbox to other
     mail boxes.

## NAME


  organizer - Calendar and address organizer
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __organizer__


## DESCRIPTION


  __organizer__ is a calendar and address organizer, enabling notes to be stored
  against the calendar days; addresses may be archived into an address book.

  __organizer__ uses the MicroEmacs 2009 in-built registry to store information
  within a registry file called _<username>_`.eof`. __organizer__ may be entered
  directly from the command line, or via the menu (via __Tools__).

  __organizer__ is displayed within a single osd dialog box, tab selections at
  the top of the window enable the different forms of information to be
  displayed. Navigation is typically performed using the mouse, where the
  mouse is absent then the `TAB` key may be used to move between the fields.
  The information presented is defined as follows:-


## Month 


  Shows the calendar month, starting with the current month, the current day
  is hi-lighted and any notes that have been entered are displayed in the
  __Notes__ entry box at the bottom of the page.

  The default mode of operation is note entries for the current month,
  however specifying the _<year>_ as the wild card '__*__' (star) enables annual
  events to be entered into the organizer. Annual events are automatically
  inserted into the calendar each year, typically used for birthdays etc.

  The entry controls to the dialog are defined as follows:-

  __<-__
  
  >  Advances to the previous month.

  __->__
  
  >  Advances to the next month.

  _<Month>_
  
  >  A pull down dialog enabling month selection.

  _<year>_
  
  >  A text entry field specifying the current year as a 4 digit number. A
     value of __*__ is the wild card year for specifying annual events.

  __Notes__
  
  >  A free form text entry box allowing a note to be attached to the
     currently selected day.

  __Save__
  
  >  Saves the entry back to file.

  __Month To Buffer__
  
  >  Dumps a view of the month to the currently active buffer, any notes
     are also dumped to the buffer.

  __Close__
  
  >  Exits the __organizer__.


## Week 


  Shows the calendar week in the current buffer, the days of the week are
  shown in a column ordering. Note that selection of the week is typically
  performed from the __Month__ view, moving to the __Week__ view (via the tab)
  selects the week appropriate to the previously selected day within the
  month view.

  The entry controls on the dialog are defined as follows:-

  __<-__
  
  >  Advances to the previous week.

  __->__
  
  >  Advances to the next week.

  _<year>_
  
  >  A text entry field specifying the current year as a 4 digit number.
     The value of __*__ for viewing and setting annual events is not valid in
     this view.

  __Notes__
  
  >  A free form text entry box allowing a note to be attached to the
     currently selected day.

  _<day>_
  
  >  Selecting a date in the _day_ column changes the view to the __Day__ view.

  __Save__
  
  >  Saves the entry back to file.

  __Week To Buffer__
  
  >  Dumps a view of the week to the currently active buffer, any notes are
     also dumped to the buffer.

  __Close__
  
  >  Exits the __organizer__.

  __Note:__ The start day in the week view may be configured to commence on a
  day other than Sunday from the __Setup__ tab.


## Day 


  Shows an extended view of the notes attached to the current day, day
  selection is typically performed from the __Month__ or __Week__ views. The entry
  controls on the dialog are defined as follows:-

  __<-__
  
  >  Advances to the previous day.

  __->__
  
  >  Advances to the next day.

  _<year>_
  
  >  A text entry field specifying the current year as a 4 digit number. A
     value of __*__ is the wild card year for specifying annual events.

  _<month>_
  
  >  A pull down dialog enabling month selection.

  _<day>_
  
  >  A text entry enabling the current day to be entered.

  __Notes__
  
  >  A free form text entry box allowing a note to be attached to the
     currently selected day.

  __Save__
  
  >  Saves the entry back to file.

  __Day To Buffer__
  
  >  Dumps a view of the day to the currently active buffer, any notes are
     printed in the buffer.

  __Close__
  
  >  Exits the __organizer__.


## Lists

## Address 


  The address pane provides entry to the address book, enabling personal and
  business details to be retained against a single name, tabbed selection of
  __Work__ or __Home__ selects the information that is displayed. A search engine is
  provide to locate names within the database, and provision is made to save
  some text against a name. Entries in the database are, by default,
  organized by record number, sorting may be explicitly performed from the
  __Sort__ button.

  Entry to the dialog is defined as follows:-

     _<userpath><userName>___.eof__ and can be altered using [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)).

  __Change Name__
  
  >  Allows the displayed name of the month and the day to be modified.

  __First Day of the week__
  
  >  Selects the first day of the week, this sets the first day to be
     displayed in the __Week__ view and the first column in the __Month__ view.

  __Min New Year Days__
  
  >  The number of days that must appear in the first week of the New Year
     for the week to be considered week 1. Modifying the value of this
     field modifies the week number.

  The __Calendar__ section allows the wordy representation of the calendar date
  to be modified. Typically used to modify the names to the native language.

  __Change Month Name__
  
  >  Select the existing month representation from the left-hand box and
     type in a new selection into the right-hand box.

  __Change Week Day Name__
  
  >  As _Change Month Name_, enables the day of the week representation to be
     modified.

  __First Day Of The Week__
  
  >  Selects the first day that appears in the __Week__ view.

  __Minimum Days of New Year in first week__
  
  >  Specifies the number of days that must appear in the first week of the
     New Year for the week to be designated as week 1. This value allows
     the week number to be aligned with the calender weeks of standard
     diaries. The default value is 7 days; but may be reduced to 5 or 6 for
     typical alignment.

  The __Address Book__ section allows the operation of the address book to be
  modified.

  __Use Extended Address Book__
  
  >  The extended address book allows additional information to be added to
     the personal address book. The extended information is limited to the
     amount of personal information attributed to an individual, including
     _Date of Birth_ and _Child_ information.

  __Import From File__
  
  >  The __Import__ from file allows the address book to be imported from a
     file. The import data format is a single line per entry, comma `,`
     separated. The field order is defined as follows, the __*__ entries
     indicate the __Extended__ __Address__ __Book__ fields:-

            Record No, First Name, Surname, Nick Name, Selected, Notes,
            Partner First Name, Partner Surname, Home Address, Home Telephone,
            Home Fax, Home Mobile, Home E-Mail, Home WWW Page, Home FTP Site,
            Work Company, Work Address, Work Telephone, Work Fax, Work Mobile,
            Work E-Mail, Work WWW Page, Work FTP Site, Date-Of-Birth*, Partner
            DOB*, Date-Of-Marriage*, Child1 Name*, Child1 DOB*, Child2 Name*,
            Child2 DOB*, Child3 Name*, Child3 DOB*.

  __Export To File__
  
  >  Exports the address book to a file, the address book is exported in
     the current sort order, with the fields defined as above. The exported
     address book may then be imported into a 3rd party package i.e.
     Microsoft Access, etc.

  The __Default Address Find Settings__ section defines the default search
  criteria used in the address book search function.

  __Whole__/__Start__/__Any Part__
  
  >  Radio buttons determine how the search is performed on the string.

  - Whole matches the whole string exactly.
  - Start matches the first part of the string only (i.e. Ab*).
  - Any Part finds entries that include the search string at any
    position within the data base search field.

  __Case Insensitive__
  
  >  Checked, matches the strings regardless of case. (default).

  __Magic Mode__
  
  >  Allows magic strings to be included in the search string.


## NOTES


  __organizer__ is a macro that is implemented in `organiz*.emf` files. Organizer
  uses [osd(2)](osd(2)) to create and manage the dialogs.

  The maximum size of a text note is 1024 characters.

  With an new address is created it is added to the end of the address list
  regardless of the current sort criteria.

  __Organizer__ replaces the original __Calendar__ utility.

  __spell-buffer__  
  _n_ __spell-word__ ["_word_"] (__esc $__)

## DESCRIPTION


  MicroEmacs 2009 provides an integrated spell checker with the following
  features:-

  - Different languages.
  - Dialog control of the speller.
  - Best guess capability.
  - _Replace_ and _Replace all_, _Ignore_ and _Ignore All_
  - Undo capability.
  - Adding new words and endings to speller.
  - Auto correct of commonly occurring mistakes.
  - Word finder, allows words to be searched with wild cards.

  __spell-buffer__ spell checks the current buffer, from the current position,
  to the end of the buffer. On invocation, an [osd(2)](osd(2)) dialog is opened and
  any corrections are made through this interface. If an error dialog opens
  instead the current language is not setup, please see the Language setting
  in [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) and [Locale Support](localeSupport(2)).

  The dialog provides the user with an interface from which a new spelling
  may be selected, in addition new words may be added to the spelling
  dictionary. The dialog entries are defined as follows:-

  __Word__
  
  >  The __word__ entry contains the erroneous word, this is presented in a
     text dialog box which may be manually edited to correct. If the word
     is manually corrected, then it is spell checked prior to insertion,
     and a new guess list is created. The user may elect to replace the
     word, take one of the suggestions or re-edit the misspelled word.

  __Meaning__
  
  >  The meaning button provides a convenient interface to [describe-word(3)](describe-word(3))
     for looking up the meaning of the current word. The __Insert__ button
     within the describe-word dialog will replace the current word in the
     spell-buffer.

  __Suggestions__
  
  >  The suggestions entry contains a list of suggestions as to the correct
     spelling of the word. The list is ranked in order of the best match,
     typically the misspelled word appears at (or near) the top of the
     list, unless the word is unknown or there are gross errors in the
     spelling. Selecting the word in the list with a single click of the
     mouse selects the word as the replacement, the actual replacement is
     performed by the __Replace__ or __Replace All__ buttons. Alternatively, double
     selecting a guess word replaces the word.

  __Language__
  
  >  The __language__ entry allows the user to select the current spelling
     language. The new language is chosen from the dialog box. The language
     may be changed at any time during the spell operation and is effective
     immediately. The __Ext__ languages are extended dictionaries that contain
     additional words, it is recommended that all spelling is performed
     with the extended dictionaries (where available).

  __Replace__
  
  >  The __replace__ button is activated when a new word has been edited or
     selected as a candidate for replacement. Selecting __replace__ modifies
     the erroneous word in the buffer with the newly selected word.

  __Replace All__
  
  >  The __Replace All__ button is similar to the __Replace__ button, except that
     it automatically replaces any subsequent occurrences of the erroneous
     word with the newly selected word. The replacement words are retained
     for the MicroEmacs edit session and are lost when the editor is
     closed.

  __Ignore__
  
  >  The __ignore__ button requests that the speller ignore the erroneous word
     and continue to spell the buffer.

  __Ignore All__
  
  >  The __Ignore All__ button is similar to the __Ingore__ button, except that it
     automatically ignores the erroneous word thereafter. The ignore words
     are retained for the MicroEmacs edit session and are lost when the
     editor is closed.

  __Add__
  
  >  __Add__ adds the current erroneous word to the dictionary, thereafter the
     word is recognized as a valid word. __Add__ should only be used for words
     which have no derivatives, it is generally better to add a new word
     through the __Edit__ interface where a new _base_ word may be specified with
     it's derivatives.

  __Edit__
  
  >  The __Edit__ button executes __spell-edit-word__ giving the current erroneous
     word. This allows new words and auto-corrections to be defined as well
     as existing words to be altered, see full description below.

  __Find__
  
  >  The __Find__ button executes __find-word__ giving the current word as a
     starting seed. This allows the user to search for the word using a
     simple search criteria, see full description below.

  __Undo Last__
  
  >  The __undo Last__ button restores the user to the previous spelling so
     that it may be re-entered, any replacement text that was made is
     restored to it's original spelling.

  __Close__
  
  >  Exits the speller and returns the user to the buffer.

  __spell-word__ checks a single word which is either supplied by the user, or
  if an argument is given, the word under (or to the left of) the cursor
  position. If the word is correct, a simple message-line print-out is
  given, otherwise the main spell __osd__ dialog is opened and the user may
  check the spelling within the context of the spell dialog as described
  above.

  The default key binding of "`esc $`" supplies an argument forcing __spell-word__
  to check the current buffer word. __spell-word__ is often used to check the
  spelling of a word outside of the context of the editor (i.e. when working
  on paper, or when doing at that prize crossword !!).

  __spell-edit-word__ allows words in dictionaries to be altered as well as new
  words and auto-corrections to be defined. On invocation, an __osd__ dialog is
  opened and changes are made through this interface, defined as follows:-

  __Word__
  
  >  The __word__ entry to be changed or added. If __spell-edit-word__ was executed
     via spell-buffer __Edit__ button, this will be set to the current word.

  __No word set__
  
  >  The word entry is empty, most of the functionallity will not be
     available until a word is entered.

  __New Word__
  
  >  To add a new word, the derivatives of the new word should be selected
     using the prefix and suffix options. Note that not all derivatives are
     listed, only one example derivative of each [spell rule](add-spell-rule(2)) is given.

  >  __BE CAREFUL WITH THE CASE OF THE BASE WORD:__ new words that are entered
     are case sensitive, as a general rule the _word_ in the __Word__ text box
     should be edited to it's base form and should be presented in lower
     case characters (unless it is a proper name, in which case it should
     be capitalized, or is an abbreviation or acronym when it might be
     upper case).

  >  When the appropriate derivatives of the new word have been selected,
     it may be added to the dictionary using the __Add__ button. This adds the
     word to the users personal dictionary. Please note that if there are
     numerous standard words missing then check that an _extended_ dictionary
     (designated by __Ext__ in the language) is being used, the extended
     dictionaries more than double the repertoire of words available.

  >  Words added to the dictionary may be subsequently removed using the
     __Delete__ button, typing the existing word in the __Word__ entry and
     selecting __Delete__ button removes the existing word.

  __Auto-Correct__
  
  >  Selection of the __Auto-Correct__ button allows a replacement word to be
     entered in the __To__ text entry. Selecting __Add__ adds the automatic
     correction to the speller. Thereafter, whenever the erroneous word is
     encountered the replacement word is always used to replace it, without
     user intervention.

  >  Entering an exiting _auto-correct_ word into the dialog and selecting
     __Delete__ removes an existing auto-correct entry.

  __Close__
  
  >  Exits the __Edit__ dialog.

  __find-word__ opens the word finder dialog. This allows the user to search for
  a word using a simple search criteria. (This is ideal for cheating at
  crosswords !!). The word to be searched for is entered into the __Word__ __Mask__
  and may use wild cards __*__ to represent any number of characters, __?__ to
  represent an unknown character and __[__..__]__ for a range of characters.

  For example, searching for `t?e?e` presents the list _theme_, _there_ and _these_.
  Searching for `t*n` lists all of the words beginning with `t` and ending in `n`.
  See [$find-words(5)]($find-words(5)) for a full discription of the format used by search
  engine.

  The words that match are returned in the scrolling dialog, and may be
  selected with the mouse (or cursor keys). The __Insert__ button inserts the
  selected word into the current buffer or into the __Word__ entry if executed
  from the __spell-buffer__ dialog. Note that the list presented is limited to
  200 words, selecting __next__ gets the next 200 words, and so on. The __Close__
  button exits the dialog.

  __spell-install__ allow the user to install one of the available dictionaries directly
  from within MicroEmacs. The user can interactively select one of the available dictionaries
  from the MicroEmacs message line which is then downloaded directly from the Github project
  if the command line tools `curl` and `unzip` are available on the users machine.
  

## NOTES


  The words added to the speller during a MicroEmacs session are saved when
  the editor is closed. The user is prompted to save the dictionary, if the
  dictionary is not saved then any words added are lost.

  All _ignore_ words accumulated during a spell session are lost when the
  editor is closed. In order to retain _ignore_ words, it is suggested that
  they are added to the personal dictionary rather than be ignored.

  The personal spelling dictionary is typically called _<user>__<type>_.edf, and
  is stored in the default user location. The dictionary names are specified
  in the [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) dialog.

  __find-word__ may claim to have found more words than are actually listed. The
  use of derivatives in the spell algorithm allows a single word to be
  present several times. __find-word__ counts each occurrence but it is only
  listed once.
  
  __spell-install__ is a macro implemented in `spellins.emf` and was introduced with
  MicroEmacs v091224. It is currently working only on Linux and MacOS if the command
  line tools `curl` and `unzip` are installed.

! 3 osd-search
## NAME


  osd-search - Search and annotate the current buffer
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __osd-search__


## DESCRIPTION


  __osd-search__ is a hidden macro which provides a method of searching for text
  patterns within the current buffer and annotating any matches through
  colored line hilighting. A selection of line colors are provided to allow
  different search patterns to be assigned their own color.

  __osd-search__ is generally used for annotating log files and alike, where
  indevidual lines are of interest in addition to the context about that
  line. The hilighting draws attention to the line, by providing a visual
  cue, allowing the contents of the file to be breifly scanned.

  On invocation of __osd-search__ from the menu __Search__ -> __Hilight__ __Search__ a
  [osd(2)](osd(2)) dialog is presented to the user, search patterns and their
  associated hilighting assignment are selected through this interface. The
  dialog entries are defined as follows:-

  __Search for__
  
  >  The text dialog entry box allows the search pattern to be entered.
     This may be a regular expression or plain text.

  __Color__
  
  >  The __Color__ allows the line hilighting color scheme to be selected from
     a pop-up menu. The color __Remove__ is special and allows previously
     applied line hilighting to be removed.

  __Case Sensitive__
  
  >  A check box that allows the search to be case sensitive or
     insensitive. This modifies the [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) mode.

  __Magic Mode__
  
  >  A check box that enables/disables regular expression pattern matching.
     This modifies the [magic(2m)](magic(2m)) mode.

  __Below__
  
  >  Searches and hilights lines matching the search pattern from the
     current cursor position to the end of the buffer.

  __Above__
  
  >  Searches and hilights lines matching the search pattern from the
     current cursor position to the top of the buffer.

  __All__
  
  >  Searches and hilights lines matching the search pattern for the whole
     buffer.

  __Clear All__
  
  >  Removes all line hilighting from the current buffer.

  __First__
  
  >  Moves to the top of the buffer and hilights the first line that
     matches the search pattern.

  __Next__
  
  >  Hilights the next line that matches the search pattern.

  __Reverse__
  
  >  Hilights the previous line that matches the search pattern.

  __Exit__
  
  >  Exits the hilighting search dialog.


## NOTES


  __osd-search__ is a macro implemented in `osdmisc.emf`.

! 3 scheme-editor
## NAME


  scheme-editor - Color Scheme Editor
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __scheme-editor__


## DESCRIPTION


  __scheme-editor__ is a color and font scheme editor that provides a dialog
  interface to configure the display schemes used by the editor. The schemes
  may be created or modified within the scheme editor and then committed to
  the configuration files for general use.

  The editor can be used to create both screen and printer color/font
  schemes, they are typically stored in the `macros` directory and are
  executed as macro files at start up or when printing. The standard screen
  schemes are called `scheme`_X_`.emf` and printer ones `print`_X_`.emf`.

  The __scheme-editor__ is displayed within a single dialog box, tab selections
  at the top of the dialog box enable __color__ and __scheme__ creation and/or
  modification. Navigation is typically performed using the mouse, where the
  mouse is absent then the `TAB` key may be used to move between the fields.
  The information presented is defined as follows:-

  __File Name__
  
  >  The name of the color scheme to be modified. This is the name of the
     __scheme___X___.emf__ file, omitting the file extension. See the __FILES__ section
     below for a list of standard screen and printer scheme supplied with
     MicroEmacs 2009.

  __Type__
  
  >  Defines whether the scheme is a screen or printer type.

  __Description__
  
  >  An ASCII description of the color scheme, used to identify the color
     scheme.

  __Buffer Hilight__
  
  >  Available when scheme is a screen type. Defines whether buffer
     hilighting should be enabled, when _Completely Disable_ all buffers are
     displayed character for character in the standard text scheme, this
     will ensure maximum update performance but some file formats such as
     the on-line help will become unreadable so this option is really
     selected. Similarly _Reformat Only_ disables the majority of buffers,
     hilighting is only enabled when the file would be unreadable without
     it, such as the on-line help or man page files. The default Fully
     Enabled setting enables all buffer hilighting.

  __Print Option__
  
  >  Available when scheme is a printer type. Defines what components of a
     scheme is to be used when printing.


## Colors 


  The __colors__ tab allows the basic palette colors of the editor to be created
  and modified. The left-hand side of the dialog contains a scrolling window
  containing the existing color entries. The right-hand side of the dialog
  provides the controls to add and change the color assignment. The controls
  operate on the currently selected palette entry.

  __Cursor__
  
  >  Defines the colour of the text cursor.

  __Show in Dialogs__
  
  >  Defines whether the cursor should be displayed in the main OSD
     dialogs, this improves usability of the dialogs when limited colors
     are available. Indirectly sets bit `0x20` of [$system(5)]($system(5)).

  __Red__/__Green__/__Blue__
  
  >  The color entries allow the currently selected palette color entry to
     be modified. The color values may be changed by direct numeric entry
     (0..255) or via the ^/v controls; the color is committed to the
     palette using the __Add__ or __Change__ button.

  __Change__
  
  >  Commits changes to the currently selected color in the palette.

  __Add__
  
  >  Creates and adds a new color entry into the palette. The new palette
     entry is created with a default color that may be subsequently
     modified.


## Schemes 


  The __schemes__ tab allows the schemes to be edited. The left-hand side of the
  dialog contains a scrolling window of the available color palette (created
  from the __Colors__ tab). The right-hand side of the window shows the variants
  of the scheme.

  __Selection__
  
  >  The __selection__ item provides a pull-down menu containing gross scheme
     categories used by the editor.

  __Scheme__
  
  >  A pull-down menu containing the schemes of the selection, modifying
     this entry shows the variants of the scheme in the __Normal__, __Current__,
     __Select__ and __Sel-Cur__ dialogs.

  __Reset__
  
  >  Resets the current scheme back to the default _Standard Text_ scheme.

  >  There are 4 variants, or styles, for a single scheme; each style is
     comprised of a foreground and background color, and a row of toggle button
     to enable/disable fonts, defined as follows.

  >  `B` - Bold.  
     `I` - Italic.  
     `L` - Light (typically not supported).  
     `R` - Reverse video (fore/back-ground swapped).  
     `U` - Underline.  
     `V` - Toggle reverse video when inverted.  

  >  The last mode __V__ needs a little more explanation; commands such as
     [screen-poke(2)](screen-poke(2)) are able to invert the color scheme, i.e. use the fore
     color for the background etc. Enabling this mode will toggle the reverse
     video mode (__R__) when this feature is used.

  >  The style displayed by a particular scheme depends upon the
     selection/current status of the text:

  __Normal__
  
  >  The normal style, when the text object is not selected or current
     (i.e. out of focus).

  __Current__
  
  >  The style used when the text object is current (i.e. in focus)

  __Select__
  
  >  The style used when the text object is selected (i.e. by the mouse)
     and is not current.

  __Sel-Cur__
  
  >  The style used when the text object is selected and is current.

  >  Note that a printer scheme only uses the Normal style.

  >  Setting of the __selection__ and __scheme__ shows the current scheme in the
     __Normal__, __Current__, __Select__ and __Sel-Cur__ dialogs. New colors are assigned by
     selecting a color in the palette area and making it current. The current
     color is applied by selecting the __Fore__ / __Back__ boxes of the scheme dialog.
     The assigned color is displayed in the text box _The big brown fox..._.


## Controls 


  The controls at the bottom of the dialog apply the edits to the
  configuration files.

  __Current__
  
  >  Makes the changes to the palette and schemes current, they are applied
     to the current editing session but are not committed to file. This
     allows the palette changes to be used prior to commitment. Note that
     all modifications are lost if they are not saved and the editing
     session is terminated.

  __Save__
  
  >  Saves the scheme modifications to file, effectively making the changes
     permanent. Note however that the scheme macro file will be saved in
     the first directory in the [$search-path(5)]($search-path(5)), regardless of the location
     of the original. For network systems this typically means that the
     changes will only effect the current user.

  __Install__
  
  >  Installs the current color scheme into the configuration files, making
     the color scheme accessible to the [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) dialog.
     In case you use a BFS execuable where the macro files are read-only files
     as they are  embedded  within the  executable,  you have to write out the
     `schemes.emf`    file    manually    by    loading    it    first    from
     `bfs://macros/schemes.emf`  and  then  writing  it to your  configuration
     folder, usually `~/.jasspa/schemes.emf`.
     
     

  __Exit__
  
  >  Quits the scheme editor without modifying the settings.


## FILES


  `scheme.emf` - Defines the standard scheme variables, including the
                 available scheme list, and associated text.  
  `schemed.emf` - Default white on black color scheme.  
  `schemej.emf` - Black on cream color scheme.  
  `schemear` - Artur.      
  `schemeal` - Ayu Light - 21 color theme used by xrdb-scheme.    
  `schemeal` - Ayu Dark  - 21 color theme used by xrdb-scheme.      
  `schemebh` - Blue Hue.  
  `schemebr` - Browie.        
  `schemedr` - Dracula.      
  `schemepd` - Plain Black on Cream.  
  `schemepl` - Plain White on Black.  
  `schemevi` - Sandy shores.  
  `schemesf` - Sherwood Forest.  
  `schemesl` - Solarized Light.  
  `schemesd` - Solarized Dark.    
  `schemetl` - Tango Light.  
  `schemetd` - Tango Dark.    
  `schemel` - Black on grey.  
  `schememd` - Microsoft Developer Studio Colors.  
  `printers.emf` - Defines the list of available printer schemes and drivers.  
  `printd` - Default plain print-out.  
  `printf` - Print using fonts.  
  `printepc` - Print using Epson base colors and fonts.


## NOTES


  __scheme-editor__ is a macro that is implemented in file `schemosd.emf`. The
  scheme editor uses [osd(2)](osd(2)) to create and manage the dialogs.

  Only the Normal scheme style is used by printer schemes.

  The setting of __Buffer Hilight__ can effect the way buffer hooks are load so
  changing from one scheme to another with differing Buffer Hilight settings
  may not fully work. This can be rectified by restart MicroEmacs with the
  new scheme as default.

  The current screen scheme can effect the printing due to the __Buffer__
  __Hilight__ setting, e.g. if the screen scheme is set to completely disable
  hilighting then any print-out will also have no hilighting.

  __Menu Line__
  
  >  The _Menu Line_ appears at the top of the buffer. A left click of the
     mouse on the menu line shows a menu dialog for user selection.

  __Window__
  
  >  The windows appear at the center of the frame, typically with a scroll
     bar to the right of the window and a __Mode Line__ at the bottom of the
     window. The mouse interactions with the window are defined as
     follows:-

  >  Left mouse in window - Selecting a region
  
  > >   Regions may be selected with the mouse. Select a position with the
        left mouse, keep the left button pressed move the mouse to the
        desired region end and release the left button. Theregion is
        hilighted, the text is copied the user does not need to perform
        any other selection operation to copy the text.

  >  Right mouse in window - Pop up Dialog

  > >   A right mouse click in the window brings up a context sensitive
        pop-up menu. A right click on a spelling error, with [auto-spell(3)](auto-spell(3))
        enabled shows a list of possible corrections.

  >  Right mouse on mode line - Pop up Dialog

  > >   A right mouse click on the Mode Line brings up a pop-up menu to
        control the buffer.

  >  Left mouse on mode line - split and resize window
   
  > >   If the \| character is selected on the Mode Line then the window is
        split into two horizontally. If the mode line is dragged with the
        mouse then the buffer is re-sized. If the window is dragged into
        another window then the other window is deleted.

  >  Left mouse on scroll bar - Up/down action
   
  > >   A left click on the scroll bar moves the window up/down. If the =
        component of the scroll bar is selected then the window is split
        into two vertically. Dragging the scroll-bar with the mouse
        horizontally causes the window to be re-sized. Selecting the * in
        the corner of the window allows the window to be resized both
        horizontally and vertically.

  >  Right mouse on scroll bar - Scroll bar size
        A right click of the mouse on the scroll bar allows the scroll bar
        width to be altered.

  > Message Line

  > >   The message line is used from command entry and messages. On entering
        a command such as [isearch-forward(2)](isearch-forward(2)) then the user enters text into
        the __Message Line__ until the command completes. Messages are also
        displayed in the message line using [ml-write(2)](ml-write(2)).

  > Toolbar

  > >   The toolbar window is displayed if [toolbar](toolbar(3)) mode is enabled in
        [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)). The mouse interaction is a little different from a
        conventional mode line, a mouse right click on the toolbar __Mode Line__
        allows the tollbar to be configured. A Right click on the `<` and `>`
        characters of the toolbar mode line moves to the next or previous
        tool.


## MAIN MENU


  The main menu is provided to give an easier access to parts of MicroEmacs
  functionality, the menu is not burnt into MicroEmacs but defined on
  start-up in `me.emf` and `osd.emf`. The [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) command can be used to
  set whether the menu is always visible and if the Alt-Hotkeys are enabled
  (i.e. '`A-f`' to open the __File__ menu).

  The main menu is [osd(2)](osd(2)) dialog number `0` so key bindings can be made which
  will open the main menu, an argument of `0` will simply open the main menu,
  an argument of `0x0n0000` will not only open the main menu but also the `n`th
  sub menu, e.g. to open the edit menu use:

            0x020000 osd


  Following is a brief description of the main menu items:


## File Menu 


  `New`
  
  >  Changes the current buffer to a new buffer.

  `Open`
  
  >  Opens a dialog enabling the user to select files for opening into
     MicroEmacs. By default the dialog opens the selected file using
     command [find-file(2)](find-file(2)), but if the view option is selected the
     [view-file(2)](view-file(2)) command is used. The binary or encrypt options configure
     whether the files are to be loaded with [binary(2m)](binary(2m)) or [crypt(2m)](crypt(2m)) modes
     enabled.

  `Quick Open`
  
  >  Opens a sub-menu list all user file types (defined in [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3))).
     Selecting one will open another sub-dialog list all files of that type
     in the current directory, selecting a file will open it using command
     [find-file(2)](find-file(2)).

  `Favorites`
  
  >  Opens a sub-menu enabling the user to add new favorite files or macros, edit the

     If the line starts with a exclamation mark the text following this exclamation mark
     is executed using the "execute-string" macro. For instance the two lines:

          \Ha help Operating modes
          !help-item "Operating Modes"
          
     would load the appropiate help page. Macros can't be not added like files using the "Add"
     menu entry but must be written manually using the "Edit" menu entry.
     
     The favorite file using to store the list is "__$MENAME__`.eff`" and is saved in
     the first path given in the [$search-path(5)]($search-path(5)). Each favorite file takes
     2 lines in the file, the first is the text displayed in the dialog
     (note that characters '`\`' and '`&`' must be protected with a '`\`' and the
     '`&`' can be used to set the Hot key) and the second line is the file
     name. A line with a single '`-`' character creates a separater line in

## NOTES


  The main menu is defined using [osd(2)](osd(2)) in macro files me.emf and osd.emf.

  General user extensions to the main menu can be added to the user file
  `myosd.emf` which is executed once when the main menu is first opened. The
  macro file can add new items to any of the main sub menus and can delete
   most existing items (some are dynamically added when appropriate, these
  should not be deleted). See `osd.emf` for examples of how to add items to
  the menu.

  New sub-menus should be added in the company or user setup files as this
  must be done at start-up. The content on the menu is not required until
  the main menu is used so populating the new sub-menu can be done in
  `myosd.emf`.

  consists of 3 pages which are defined as follows:-


## Contents 


  The contents page displays a list on contents similar to the [help(2)](help(2)) high
  level help page. Selecting an item will display the help page in a buffer,
  selecting __Exit__ will exit the dialog.


## Index 


  The index page gives a list of help items, the __Scope__ menu can be used to
  narrow the index list to the required item type.


## Search 


  The search page provides a way of searching the on-line help for a given
  topic. Similarly to the Index page, the __Scope__ menu is provided to narrow
  the search to the required area.

  The search strings is considered to be made up of items separated by
  spaces, an item can be enclosed in quotes ('`"`') so that the item can
  include a space. If the first letter of an item is a '`+`' the given item
  must be found in a page for it to match, if the character is a '`-`' the
  item must NOT be found on a page for it to match, or other items are
  considered optional. At least one item must be found on a page for it to
  be a match, the numbers to the right of each found page is the number of
  items found.


## NOTES


  See [Help!](Help!) for help on the on-line help pages.

  __osd-help__ is a macro using [osd(2)](osd(2)), defined in osdhelp.emf.

! 3 file-attrib
## NAME


  file-attrib - Set the current buffers system file attributes
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __file-attrib__


## DESCRIPTION


  __file-attrib__ opens a dialog enabling the user to change the system
  properties of the current buffer's file. Top of the dialog give the
  current buffer name and its file name. The `Save Changes` button writes the
  current buffer out with any current edits and changes to its file
  attributes. The `Ok` button closes the file-attrib dialog, any changes made
  to the file attributes will be applied next time the buffer is written.

  The type allow the changing between UNIX, MS Windows and DOS text file
  formats. UNIX has a single new line character ('`\n`') where as Windows and
  Dos have a double new line character ('`\r\n`'). Also a Dos text file is
  terminated with a `C-z` (0x1A) character which the other two do not. These
  attribute are set in MicroEmacs by using buffer modes [cr(2m)](cr(2m)), [lf(2m)](lf(2m)) and
  [ctrlz(2m)](ctrlz(2m)).

  The central part of the dialog contains system dependent attributes which
  are defined as follows:

  __UNIX Platforms__
  
  >  Allow the setting of user, group and global, read, write and execute
     permissions, see man pages on __chmod(1)__ for more information. This is a
     front end to setting the variable [$buffer-fmod(5)]($buffer-fmod(5)).

  __Win32 Platforms__
  
  >  Allow the setting of MS Windows file attributes, i.e. read-only,
     hidden, archive etc. Note that the directory attribute is displayed
     but cannot be altered. This is a front end to setting the variable
     [$buffer-fmod(5)]($buffer-fmod(5)).

  __DOS Platform__
  
  >  Allow the setting of MS Dos file attributes, i.e. read-only, hidden,
     archive etc. Note that the directory attribute is displayed but cannot
     be altered.

! 3 describe-word
## NAME


  describe-word - Display a dictionary definition of a word
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __describe-word__ "_word_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __describe-word__ can be used to interface to an external dictionary to get a
  definition of a given word. The interface has two modes of interface, the
  first simply launches an external program which provides the definition in
  its own user interface, e.g. MS Bookshelf. The second interface launches
  an external program which prints out the definition to `stdout`, MicroEmacs
  can then pull out the definition and display it in __describe-word__'s own
  GUI.

  When executed __describe-word__ will use the current word under the cursor as
  the initial _word_ or will prompt the user if the cursor is not in a word.

  When __describe-word__'s dialog is used the information presented is defined
  as follows:

  __Word__
  
  >  The word being defined, the entry can be edited and the new word will
     be automatically looked-up when the edit is completed.

  __Insert__
  
  >  The effect of this button is dependent on where describe-word was
     executed. If executed from the __Meaning__ button within the [spell checker](spell-buffer(3))
     the Word entry is changed to the current word. When executed outside
     the spell checker the definition of the current word is inserted into
     the current buffer.

  __Exit__
  
  >  Closes the dialog.

  Main definition box
  
  >  Displays the definition of the current word. The user can select a new
     word to describe by clicking the left mouse button on any word within
     the current definition.


## NOTES


  __describe-word__ is a macro implemented in `word.emf`.

  Due to the size and availability of dictionaries etc. MicroEmacs is
  released without describe-word set up, the user must setup it up.

  __describe-word__ must be setup for each required language as follows:

  __1)__
 
  >  A command-line interface to a dictionary of the required language must
     be found. This could simply be a text file containing one word
     definition per line and using __grep(1)__ as the command-line interface.
     In this example the text file could take the following form:

            A () The first letter of the English...
            Aam (n.) A Dutch and German measure of liquids...
            Aardvark (n.) An edentate mammal...
            .
            .


  >  The __grep__ command-line interface required to look-up the word
     "`aardvark`" would be:

            grep -i "^aardvark (" words.txt


  >  The output produced from this will be the single line giving the
     required definition. A second common interface would be executing an
     external dictionary program typically using a command-line option to
     specify the word to define, e.g.:

            mydict -d "aardvark"


  __2)__
   
  >  The MicroEmacs language name must be found, this can be done by first
     using [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) or [spell-buffer(3)](spell-buffer(3)) to ensure that the current
     language is set the the require one and then running __describe-word__.
     The command will probably fail, but before it does it will set the
     variable `.describe-word.lang`, use the command [describe-variable(2)](describe-variable(2)) to
     get the value of this variable, this value is the internal language
     name. For example, when the current language is __American__ or American
     (Ext) the language name is `american`.

  __3)__
  
  >  To execute the command-line interface the variable
     `.describe-word.`_<language>_`-command` must be set to the command-line
     required to obtain a word definition with the string "`%s`" used in
     place of the word and "`%%`" using in place of a single "`%`". For the
     first example in __(1)__ above the following would be required:

```{.emf}
            set-variable .describe-word.american-command ...
                    ... "grep -i \"^%s (\" /tmp/words.txt"

```
     For the second example:

```{.emf}
            set-variable .describe-word.american-command "mydict -d \"%s (\""

```

  __4)__

  >  Only required for the second mode, for use with __describe-word__'s own
     GUI, the setting of another variable is required, the presence of this
     variable determines which mode is to be used.

  >  The variable `.describe-word.`_<language>_`-search` must be set to a
     [regex search pattern](RegularExpressions(2)) which will match the required definition(s) in the
     command out put, the first group ("`\(...\)`") must enclose the required
     definition, again "`%s`" can be used in place of the word and "`%%`" for a
     single "`%`". __describe-word__ simply uses [search-buffer(2)](search-buffer(2)) repeatedly to
     find all definitions of the current word, it then uses the value of
     the variable [@s1(4)](@s1(4)) to get the individual definitions. For example for
     the first example the following is required:

```{.emf}
            set-variable .describe-word.american-search  "^\(%s (.*\)\n"

```

  >  Note that the word being defined should be kept in the definition if
     possible as the [spell rules](add-spell-rule(2)) are used to look-up base words when a
     derivitive of a word is not found, therefore the word being defined
     may not be clear (e.g. _deactivate_ can be derived from _activate_ but
     their meanings are very different). Also long text lines are
     automatically wrapped by the GUI.

  The required variables should be added to the user setup file.

! 3 major-mode-setup
## NAME


  major-mode-setup - Configures the current buffer settings
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __major-mode-setup__


## DESCRIPTION


  The __Major Mode__ defines the operational mode of the buffer, controlling
  highlighting and additional commands that are available. The _Major Mode_ is
  determined by the file type content and is determined from the file
  extension or _Magic String_ in the first few lines of the file.

  __major-mode-setup__ provides a dialog interface to configuring the setup of
  the current buffer's file type within MicroEmacs. __major-mode-setup__ may be
  invoked from the main _Tools_ menu or directly from the command line using
  [execute-named-command(2)](execute-named-command(2)).

  The changes made to a configuration in __major-mode-setup__ are maintained in
  future MicroEmacs sessions by storing them within the user's setup
  registry file, "_<logname>_`.erf`". Note that not all file types may be
  supported by __major-mode-setup__, if not the help menu item will not be
  available.

  The contents of the dialog change, depending on the features the current
  buffer's file type supports. These features are implemented and installed
  within the [buffer's file hook](fileHooks(2)). The following buttons are always present at
  the bottom of the dialog:

  `Save`
  
  >  Saves the changes made to the configuration back to the users registry
     file, i.e. "_<Log-Name>_`.erf`" but does not re-initialize the current
     buffer. No changes made will effect the current buffer unless the
     __Current__ button is pressed. Buffers of the same type created after the
     save may inherrit some of the changes.

  `Current`
  
  >  Makes the current buffer reflect the changes made, dismissing the
     __major-mode-setup__ dialog. This also performs the above '__Save__'
     operation. Some changes such as dialog creation changes, will only
     take effect when MicroEmacs is restarted.

  `Cancel`
  
  >  Quits major-mode-setup, if changes where not __Save__d or made __Current__
     they will be lost.

  Following is a list of configurable features which may be available:

  > Create Help Page
 
  > >   Enables/disables the creation of a help page dialog for the tools
        available for the current file type.

  > Create Tools Menu
  
  > >   Enables/disables the creation of a file type specific sub menu located
        within the main menu's __Tools__ sub-menu.

  > Use Author Mode

  > >   For file types which have an automatic formatter/viewer (currently
        only html) enabling this will simply load the file enabling the source
        code to be viewed and edited. When disabled files of this type will be
        automatically processed giving a more readable 'formatted'
        representation.

  > Insert New Template
 
  > >   When creating a new buffer/file of this type, a default template will
        be inserted if this is enabled. When disabled the buffer will remain
        empty.

  > Fence Display

  > >   Enables or disables the displaying of matching fences for this file
        type. Note that the way in which the matching fence is display is
        determined by the __Fence Display__ option on the Platform page of
        [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)); the major-mode-setup option is ignored if this option
        is set to "`Never Display`".

  > Setup Hilighting

  > >   Creates and enables the token [hilighting](hilight(2)) for the current file type.

  > Setup Auto Indent

  > >   Enables automatic formating (indenting) for the current file type. The
        indentation rules are either the built in ['C' indentation](indent(2)) or created
        explicitly using the [indent(2)](indent(2)) command. When enabled the [tab(2m)](tab(2m)) is
        still adhered to, but the [indent(2m)](indent(2m)) mode is ignored; when disabled
        the indent mode can be used.

  > Setup Auto Spell

  > >   Enables the setting up of [auto-spell(3)](auto-spell(3)). When enabled the auto-spell
        key bindings are created and auto-spell is enabled if enabled within
        the user-setup dialog.

  > Setup Folding
  
  > >   Enables the setting up of section [folding](collapse-current(3)), when enabled the folding
        key bindings are created.

  > Add Abbreviations

  > >   Adds the file type's abbreviation file to the buffer using
        [buffer-abbrev-file(2)](buffer-abbrev-file(2))

  > Search Modes: Exact

  > >   Enables/disables the [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) mode over-riding the setting within the
        [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) dialog. If this setting is changed the setting within
        user-setup will be ignored for the current file type.

  > Search Modes: Magic

  > >   Enables/disables the [magic(2m)](magic(2m)) mode over-riding the setting within the
        [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) dialog. If this setting is changed the setting within
        user-setup will be ignored for the current file type.

  > Buffer Modes: Auto

  > >   Enables/disables the [auto(2m)](auto(2m)) mode.

  > Buffer Modes: Backup

  > >   Enables/disables the [backup(2m)](backup(2m)) mode.

  > Buffer Modes: Indent
    
  > >   Enables/disables the [indent(2m)](indent(2m)) mode.

  > Buffer Modes: Justify
    
  > >   Enables/disables the [justify(2m)](justify(2m)) mode.

  > Buffer Modes: Tab

  > >   Enables/disables the [tab(2m)](tab(2m)) mode over-riding the setting within the
        [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) dialog. If this setting is changed the setting within
        user-setup will be ignored for the current file type.

  > Buffer Modes: Time

  > >   Enables/disables the [time(2m)](time(2m)) mode.

  > Buffer Modes: Undo

  > >   Enables/disables the [undo(2m)](undo(2m)) mode over-riding the setting within the
        [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) dialog. If this setting is changed the setting within
        user-setup will be ignored for the current file type.

  > Buffer Modes: Wrap
    
  > > Enables/disables the [wrap(2m)](wrap(2m)) mode.

! 3 print-setup
## NAME


  print-setup - Configure MicroEmacs's printer interface
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __print-setup__


## DESCRIPTION


  __print-setup__ provides a dialog interface for configuring MicroEmacs's
  printing interface. __print-setup__ may be invoked from the main _File_ menu or
  directly from the command line using [execute-named-command(2)](execute-named-command(2)).

  The __print-setup__ dialog is broken down into three pages of configuration
  options, the following buttons are available at the bottom of each
  dialog:-

  `Print`
  
  >  Prints the current buffer using the current configuration.

  `Exit`
  
  >  Quits __print-setup__, changes made to the configuration are saved.

  The following pages appear in the dialog:-


## Printer 


  The __Printer__ page is used to configure the _type_, _style_ and _location_ of the
  printer, the items on this page are defined as follows:-

  `Driver`
  
  >  Sets the printer type to be used, selecting this item creates a drop
     down list of available printer drivers. The drivers inform MicroEmacs
     which fonts and colors are available and how to enable/disable them,
     these are usually special character sequences. The following special
     drivers are defined:-

  >  Default Plain Text

  > >  This driver does not use any special character sequences so the
       output it produces is plain text. This should work with most
       printers, but it does not support any colors or fonts.

  >  HTML
   
  > >  This is a virtual printer driver as no printer uses HTML directly.
       However the files produced by this driver can be loaded by a
       web-browser and rendered with full color and font support so
       provides an efficient way of testing printer schemes. In addition
       may be used to convert the text rendered in MicroEmacs into HTML
       content.

  >  Windows

  > >  This utilizes MicroEmacs's built-in Windows printer interface
       (Windows platforms only). When selected MicroEmacs communicates
       directly to the MS Printer Manager.

  `Print Scheme`
  
  >  Defines the color and font scheme to be used, selecting this item
     creates a drop down list of available printer schemes - choose the
     most appropriate one for your printer. The _Default Plain Text_ scheme
     does not use any color or fonts and should work for all drivers. See
     the next item for scheme creation and editing.

  `Edit`
  
  >  Opens the [scheme-editor(3)](scheme-editor(3)) dialog box to edit the currently selected
     printer scheme. The editor may be used to create and install new
     printer schemes.

  `Destination`
  
  >  Specifies the destination print output, when selected a drop down menu
     appears with the following items:

  >  To buffer only
  
  > >   Creates a "*printer*" buffer and prints to that buffer.

  >  To file only
  
  > >   Creates a new temporary file and prints to it.

  >  To file & print

  > >   Prints to a temporary file and then executes the command-line (see
        next item) to print the resultant file. This option is not
        available when using the Windows printer driver.

  >  Direct to printer

  > >   Output is sent directly to the printer. The option is only
        available when using the Windows driver.

  `Command-line`
  
  >  Sets the command-line required to print a generated print file (option
     not available when the Windows driver is selected as printing is
     performed directly by the MS Print Manager). The command-line should
     be a single shell command using "`%f`" to reference the name of the file
     to be printed, e.g. on UNIX systems __lp(1)__ or __lpr(1)__ may be used as
     follows:-

            lp -s %f


  >   On MS-DOS machines this may be performed by copying the file to the
     `PRN` device, as follows:

            copy %f PRN


  `Page Layout`

   >  Displays the current page configuration in the form:

            ColumnsxRows Chars-WidexChars-High

   > the fields cannot be edited directly, the settings in __Page Setup__
     affect these values.


## Page Setup 


  `Paper Size`
  
  >  Defines the size of the printer paper, selecting this item produces a
     pop down menu listing of all available paper sizes. If the the Windows
     printer driver is being used this field cannot be selected and the
     __Edit__ button is used instead.

  `Page Size`
  
  >  Defines the printable size of the page in terms of the number of
     characters which will fit on the paper (_width___x___height_). When selected a
     drop down menu lists all available sizes for the current paper size.
     This option is not available with the Windows driver and the __Edit__
     button should be used.

  `Edit` (Windows only)
  
  >  Opens a Windows printer dialog box allowing the user to specify the
     windows printer, paper size and character size, etc.

  `No. of Columns` and `Rows`
  
  >  Defines the page subdivision in terms of sub-columns and rows, thereby
     creating sub-pages within a page.

  `Print Line Numbers`
  
  >  When enabled, prints the line number at the left hand edge of each
     line.

  `Print Split Line IDs`
  
  >  When enabled the last right hand text column is reserved for a split
     line identifier. Whenever a line is too long to fit on a single line
     it is split over two or more lines, if this option is enabled the
     right edge will be set to the split character (usually a '`\`' char) to
     clearly indicate that the line is split.

  `Page Layout`
  
  >  As with the __Printer__ __Page Layout__, displays the current page
     configuration, the field cannot be edited.


## Layout 


  `Margins`
  
  >  Configures the top, bottom, left and right margins of the page in
     terms of characters.

  `Print Header`
  
  >  Defines whether a header should be printed and its format. The
     following escape sequence is interpreted:

  >  `%%`
            Print a '%' character.

  >  `%b`
            Print the current buffer's name.

  >  `%D`
            Print the current day of the month.

  >  `%f`
            Print the current buffer's file name.

  >  `%h`
            Print the current hour.

  >  `%M`
            Print the current month of the year.

  >  `%m`
            Print the current minute of the hour.

  >  `%p`
            Print the current page number.

  >  `%s`
            Print the current seconds.

  >  `%Y`
            Print the current year as a 2 digit number.

  >  `%y`
            Print the current year as a 4 digit number.

  `Print Footer`
  
  >  Defines whether a footer should be printed at the end of the page and
     the format. The header escape sequence characters are used.


## NOTES


  __print-setup__ is a macro using [osd(2)](osd(2)), defined in `printstp.emf`.

  The list of available printer drivers and print schemes is stored in the
  macro file `printers.emf`. To create a new printer driver a new
  configuration registry file (`erf` file - see `print*.erf` for examples) must
  be created and added to the printer driver lists within `printer.emf`.

  The `printers.emf` file also contains a list of printing schemes, using the
  __Install__ option of the [scheme-editor(3)](scheme-editor(3)). [scheme-editor(3)](scheme-editor(3)) automatically
  adds the new scheme to the print schemes list.

! 3 line-scheme
## NAME


  line-scheme - Apply line annotation in current buffer
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _n_ __line-scheme__


## DESCRIPTION


  __line-scheme__ applies or removes line hilighting by assignment of the buffer
  line variable [$line-scheme(5)]($line-scheme(5)). The numerical argument _n_ is the line scheme
  number to apply to the line or region when omitted (or specified as 1)
  then any line hilighting is removed.

  If a region is defined then the command operates as follows:-

  Region contained on a single line
  
  >  When the region is contained on a single line then this is assumed to
     be a search string and all lines in the buffer that match the region
     text are hilighted with the color scheme _n_.

  Region spans multiple lines
  
  >  When the region spans multiple lines then all of the lines of the
     region are hilighted with the color scheme _n_.

  __line-scheme__ is typically invoked from the pop-up menu (mouse right) to
  apply line hilighting annotation to a line or region. The user may select
  to apply a region hilight, remove the region hilight, remove all
  hilighting or perform a search using [osd-search(3)](osd-search(3)).

! 3 buffer-setup
## NAME


  buffer-setup - Configure the current buffer settings
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __buffer-setup__


## DESCRIPTION


  __buffer-setup__ provides a dialog interface for configuring the buffer major
  mode, indentation and buffer modes. __buffer-setup__ may be invoked from the
  main _Tools_ menu or directly from the command line using
  [execute-named-command(2)](execute-named-command(2)).

  The __buffer-setup__ dialog may be used to quickly reconfigure the attributes
  of a given buffer. The settings are only temporary and expire once the
  buffer has been closed or re-loaded. [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)) should be used to
  associate user specific settings with different buffer types.

  The following controls are available:-

  __Major Mode__
  
  >  Associates a file type with the content of the file and is used to
     modify the buffer highlighting and content assisted controls if the
     file type has not been recognized correctly. Changing the major mode
     will cause the new file type template to be loaded and may cause the
     buffer key bindings to change. The default major mode settings are set
     with [major-mode-setup(3)](major-mode-setup(3)).

  __Indent Width__
  
  >  Defines the indent width to use when the TAB key is pressed, or
     following a nested construct in a auto-indent buffer. This entry
     modifies the [$buffer-indent-width(5)]($buffer-indent-width(5)) setting. The default indentation
     width is defined by the variable [$indent-width(5)]($indent-width(5)).

  __Tab Width__
  
  >  The width of a rendered TAB character in spaces, modification of this
     value immediately changes the layout. This modifies the buffer width
     tab variable [$buffer-tab-width(5)]($buffer-tab-width(5)) the default is 8 (defined by
     [$tab-width(5)]($tab-width(5))). Where files have been edited with a non-standard tab
     width then modification of this value (to typically 2 or 4) may
     correct the problem. To correct the styling of the buffer to be editor
     independent then the command [tabs-to-spaces(3)](tabs-to-spaces(3)) may be used to change
     all of the tab characters to spaces once the tab width has been
     correctly set.

  __Fill Column__
  
  >  A text layout variable, defines the maximum length of the line before
     wrapping occurs when a text paragraph is filled. This modifies the
     buffer fill column variable [$buffer-fill-col(5)]($buffer-fill-col(5)) the default is 78
     (defined by [$fill-col(5)]($fill-col(5))).

  __Fill Mode__
  
  >  A text layout variable, defines how paragraphs should be filled across
     multiple lines. This modifies the buffer fill mode variable
     [$buffer-fill-mode(5)]($buffer-fill-mode(5)) the default is B which causes automatic detection
     of paragraph layout, defaulting to full justification against the left
     and right margins (defined by [$fill-mode(5)]($fill-mode(5))).

  __Use Auto Indentation__
  
  >  Toggles automatic indentation on an off, this setting is only present
     if the buffer type supports a [indent(2)](indent(2)) scheme. Typically used for
     files such as [lex](c(9)) and [yacc](c(9)) which use a special syntax combination with
     C.

  __Use Hilighting__
  
  >  Toggles hilighting on and off, this setting is only present if the
     buffer type supports a [hilight(2)](hilight(2)) scheme.

  __Buffer Modes__
  
  >  The modes of the buffer, refer to [Operating Modes](Operating Modes) for more
     information.

  >  A notable mode switch here is [tab(2m)](tab(2m)) which changes the behavior of
     the `TAB` key, when set tabs are simulated with the insertion of spaces,
     when disabled literal tab characters are used.


## HISTORY


  Prior to the 2006 release __buffer-setup__ was previously called __indent-setup__
  and dealt with the indentation settings only. The 2006 release introduced
  the concept of __Major Mode__.

## NAME


  file-type-setup - Define file type set
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __file-type-setup__


## DESCRIPTION


  __file-type-setup__ provides a dialog interface for declaring a set of common
  files type categories and their associated file extensions. The file
  categories are used to determine the common file types in the File main
  menu __Quick Open__.

  __file-type-setup__ may be invoked directly from the command line or more
  usually from the miscellaneous configuration item __File Types__ in
  [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)).

  On invocation a generic name for the file class is assigned to a set of
  file names or extensions as a comma separated list i.e. `*.a,*.b,*.c`.

## NAME


  alias-path-setup - Define alternative path alias
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __alias-path-setup__


## DESCRIPTION


  __alias-path-setup__ provides a dialog interface for declaring alternative
  alias paths. Alias path is a short name, conventionally then `~` is the home
  directory. The alias path setup allows other directory paths to be bound
  to a name i.e. "__me__" may be associated with "__/home/jon/merep/me/__". Given
  the alias definition then __~me__ expands to __/home/jon/merep/me/__.

  __alias-path-setup__ is accessible from the [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) __Miscellaneous__ tab.

  Multiple aliases may be defined and they are automatically accessible from
  the mode line when a file or directory name is entered.

! 3 file-tool-setup
## NAME


  file-tool-setup - Define file-browser tools
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __file-tool-setup__


## DESCRIPTION


  __file-tool-setup__ provides a dialog interface for declaring a set of actions
  to act on files shown in the [file-browser(3)](file-browser(3)) directory listing. Actions
  may be defined to interact with `ZIP` files for both creation and
  extraction, opening of `PDF` files with Adobe Acrobat, opening of Microsoft
  Word `DOC` files with Word or StarOffice etc. These options are shown in the
  __file-browser__ pop-up menu under __Tools__.

  The file tools may be configured from [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)) in the __Miscellaneous__
  tab or invoked directly from the command line using __file-tool-setup__, when
  invoked then the File Tool Setup dialog is displayed. The dialog allows
  commands to be be matched against certain file types that are determined
  using a regular expression, if a filename matches the pattern then a
  command line or MicroEmacs command may be invoked to process the file(s).
  The command line includes _variables_ which are filled in by MicroEmacs. The
  information is stored in the registry _user.erf_ and is retained across
  sessions.

  The __file-tool-setup__ presents a list of tools, there is no limit to the
  number of tools which can be defined or to the number of tools that may
  map to a specific file type. The dialog has the following fields:

  __Name __
  
  >  Declares the name of the tool as it appears in the __Tools__ section of
     the [file-browser(3)](file-browser(3)) pop-up menu. A single menu short-cut key may be
     defined by prefixing the hot key with a `\H`.

  __File Mask __
  
  >  A regular expression that is used to search for files of a given type,
     this follows the standard MicroEmacs [Regular Expression](RegularExpressions(2)) syntax. As an
     example 'all files' is defined as "`.*`", PDF files are defined as
     `.*\.pdf`, image files might be defined as a set of different extensions
     `.*\.\(png\|jpg\|jpeg\|bmp\|gif\)`, etc.

  __Command __
  
  >  Defines the command line or MicroEmacs command that is executed to
     process the action. The command line comprises escape characters using
     the percentage (`%`) character, these fields are filled in automatically
     by MicroEmacs and are defined as follows:

  >  __%f__ - Filename
  
  > >  A replacement for the filename, typically passed in quotes to the
       command being executed as an argument. The filename is defined as
       a relative pathname from the current directory location. If
       multiple files are selected in the file-browser then the command
       line is executed multiple times, once for each file, unless the %*
       construct is used in conjunction with %f when multiple files may
       be specified with a single command invocation.

  >  __%b__ - Base Filename
   
  > >  The basename of the file, i.e. no pathname and no file extension.

  >  __%e__ - File Extension
   
  > >  The file extension of the filename.

  >  __%p__, __%P__ - File pathname

  > >  The pathname of the file without the filename. %p is the file path
       with '/' forward slash directory separators. %P is the same as %p
       but with '\' backslashes directory separators on Microsoft Windows
       and DOS.

  >  __%i[___h___|___prompt___|___default___]__ .. __%n__ - User Input

  > >  Specifies that the user is to be prompted for input from the
       command line. Square brackets follow the %i which defines the
       command line prompt. The %i[..] is replaced with the user input
       and may be replicated in the command line using %n where n is a
       digit 1..9 where %1 reproduces the first %i, %2 reproduces the
       second, ... etc.

  > >  h specifies the type of data to be entered including the history
       and semantics allowed. h may have the following values:

            0 For a general string input using the general history.
            1 For an absolute file name, with completion and history.
            2 For a MicroEmacs buffer name, with completion and history.
            3 For a MicroEmacs command name, with completion and history.
            4 For a file name, with completion and history.
            5 For a search string, with history.
            6 For a MicroEmacs mode name, with completion and history.
            7 For a MicroEmacs variable name, with completion and history.
            8 For a general string using no history.
            9 For a user supplied completion list (com-list).
            a For a user supplied completion list (buffer-name).

   > >  prompt is the prompt string presented on the command line.

   > >  default is the default value that should be used. The % characters
        may be used and will be replaced with information from the
        filename e.g. %b would be replaced with the base file name.

   > >  As an example of the user input, consider the following command
        line which is used to unzip a .zip file:

            unzip "%f" -d %i[4|Unzip sub-dir|%b]

  > >   Given an input file of /home/user/foo.zip then the command line
        unzip "/home/user/foo.zip" -d foo is generated, given that the
        user accepted the defualt command line prompt of "foo" for the
        prompt "Unzip sub-dir"

  > >   Where the user input is required in multiple parts of the command
        line then the %1 syntax may be used. The following example may be
        used to create a .zip archive from one or more selections in the
        file list.

            rm -f "%i[4|Zip file name|%b].zip"; zip -r %1.zip%*[ "%f"]

  > >   In this instance the user is prompted for the Zip file name and it
        is used twice in the command line, the default name is the base
        file name of the first file. Consider two files have been selected
        foo.txt and bar.txt where foo.txt is first. The generated command
        line is:

            rm -f "foo.zip"; zip -r foo.zip "foo.txt" "bar.txt"

  > >   Note how the basename has been used as the default for the zip
        file name to create and this has been used in two places in the
        command line, once to delete the old archive if it already exists
        and once to form the new archive.

  >  __%*[___argument___]__ - Multiple file command line
   
  > >   Utilities that accept multiple arguments on the command line use a
        special construct %*. By default a single command line invocation
        is made for each file, the %* construct makes a single command
        line invocation for multiple files.

  > >   The square bracket construct contains the expansion for each file
        specified in the file-browser, this will typically include the %f
        construct. For each argument then the brackets are expanded and
        concatenated together to form a command line, as such the bracket
        construct usually starts with a space character as this separates
        the files.

  > >   As an example then zip file construction will take multiple files
        on the command line to add to the archive:

            rm -f "%i[4|Zip file name|%b].zip"; zip -r %1.zip%*[ "%f"]

  >   __%"___...___%"__ - Quote text
  
  > >   Using quote tags ensures the quoted part of the command-line is
        treated as a single argument. For example, if the tool:

            unzip %f

  > >   is used for the file "Test Files.zip" the command-line becomes
        'unzip Test Files.zip' which will not work correctly, conversely
        using "%f" will not work for files with quotes (e.g.
        '2"bolt.def'). However, if

            unzip %"%f%"

  > >   is used MicroEmacs works out the best way to quote the file name
        for it to be properly processed.

  >   __*___MicroEmacs-Command_ - Internal command

  > >   Where the command commences with a star character (*) then the
        command is treated as a MicroEmacs command and is executed within
        the editor. As an example consider handling a zip file using the
        [find-zfile(3)](find-zfile(3)) command:

            *find-zfile "%f"

  > >   For each file then find-zfile is invoked to read the zip archive.

  __Default Open __
  
  >  A flag that defines whether this is the default open action. When set
     then the command is automatically launched if the file is opened in
     the __file-browser__ (usually by left clicking on the file name or
     pressing "`return`") . When clear then the tool has to be explicitly
     invoked.

  __Hide Window __
  
  >  Defines the visibility of the window associated with the command, for
     example, if the command-line uses a `cmd` shell to launch another
     process the cmd window should be hidden. This has no effect on
     internal MicroEmacs commands.

  __Up/Down __
  
  >  Changes the item order in the list/menu by moving it up or down.

  __Add __
  
  >  Adds a new tool line to the list.

  __Modify __
  
  >  Modifies the existing tool setting.

  __Delete __
  
  >  Deletes the tool from the list.

  __Close __
  
  >  Closes the tool menu.

## NAME


  &rep, &irep, &xrep, &xirep - Replace string in string functions


## SYNOPSIS


  __&rep__ _str1_ _str2_ _str3_  
  __&irep__ _str1_ _str2_ _str3_  
  __&xrep__ _str1_ _str2_ _str3_  
  __&xirep__ _str1_ _str2_ _str3_


## DESCRIPTION


  These functions search for _str2_ in _str1_, replacing it with _str3_, returning
  the resultant string.

  The functions may all be abbreviated to their three letter abbreviation
  (i.e. __&xirep__ may be expressed as __&xir__). In all cases the first argument is
  completely evaluated before the second and third arguments.

  __&rep__ _string_ _search_ _replace_
  
  >  Searches for the _search_ string in the given _string_ using a simple case
     sensitive exact match algorithm. Any occurrences are removed from
     _string_ and _replace_ is inserted in its place. Either of the 3 input
     strings can be the empty string (`""`).

  __&irep__ _string_ _search_ _replace_
  
  >  __&irep__ is identical to __&rep__ except a case insensitive search algorithm
     is used.

  __&xrep__ _string_ _regex-search_ _regex-replace_
  
  >  __&xrep__ can be used to access the more powerful regular expression
     searching capabilities. The function is similar to __&rep__ except it
     takes a regex search string and the replacement string may also refer
     to all or part of the matched string. See [Regular Expressions](RegularExpressions(2)) for
     information on the _regex_ format.

  __&xirep__ _string_ _regex-search_ _regex-replace_
  
  >  __&xirep__ is identical to __&xrep__ except a case insensitive regex search is
     used.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example turns a UNIX format file name (using a '`/`' to divide
  directories - like MicroEmacs) into an windows format name (using a '`\`'):

```{.emf}
        set-variable #l0 &rep #l0 "/" "\\"

```

  The following example replaces one or more white spaces in the variable
  with a single space, this is an easy way to remove unnecessary spaces:

```{.emf}
        set-variable #l0 "This   is   not   so    spacey    after   xrep"
        set-variable #l0 &xrep #l0 "\\s +" " "
        ml-write #l0

```

## NAME

  Numeric macro operators


## SYNOPSIS


  __&abs__ _num1_  
  __&add__ _num1_ _num2_  
  __&sub__ _num1_ _num2_  
  __&multiply__ _num1_ _num2_

  __&inc__ _variable_ _increment_  
  __&dec__ _variable_ _decrement_  
  __&pinc__ _variable_ _increment_  
  __&pdec__ _variable_ _decrement_


## DESCRIPTION


  The numeric operators operate on variables or integers to perform integer
  computations, returning the integer result of the operation. The contents
  of the variables are interpreted as signed integers typically with a
  dynamic range of 2^31 <= _num_ <= 2^31-1.

  The operators may all be abbreviated to their three letter abbreviation
  (i.e. __&multiply__ may be expressed as __&mul__). In all cases the first argument
  is completely evaluated before the second argument.

  __&abs__ _num1_
  
  >  Returns the absolute value of _num1_ i.e. if _num1_ is positive it returns
     _num1_, else -_num1_

  __&add__ _num1_ _num2_
  
  >  Addition of two numbers _num1_ and _num2_. i.e. _num1_ + _num2_

  __&sub__ _num1_ _num2_
  
  >  Subtract the second number _num2_ from the first _num1_ i.e. _num1_ - _num2_.

  __&multiply__ _num1_ _num2_
  
  >  (Signed) Multiply _num1_ by _num2_. i.e. _num1_ * _num2_. __&mul__ is the three
     letter abbreviation.

  __&div__ _num1_ _num2_
  
  >  Divide the first number _num1_ by the second _num2_, returning the integer
     result. i.e. _num1_ / _num2_. __&div__ is the three letter abbreviation.

  __&mod__ _num1_ _num2_
  
  >  Divide the first number _num1_ by the second _num2_, returning the integer
     remainder. i.e. _num1_ % _num2_.

  __&negate__ _num_
  
  >  Negate the integer (multiply by -1) i.e. -_num_. __&neg__ is the three
     letter abbreviation.

  Expression evaluation is prefix. Operators may be nested using a pre-fix
  ordering, there is no concept of brackets (in-fix notation). The
  expression `(2 * 3) + 4` is expressed as:-

```{.emf}
        &add &mul 2 3 4

```

  conversely `2 * (3 + 4)` is expressed as:-

```{.emf}
        &mul 2 &add 3 4

```

  The pre/post incrementing and decrementing operators provide a mechanism
  for stepping through indexed information without incurring the overhead of
  providing multiple statements to perform assignment operations. The
  _variable_ argument MUST be the name of a variable, it cannot be an
  expression or an indirection. The _increment_ may be any integer expression
  (including another auto (dec)increment). Note that _variable_ is re-assigned
  with it's new value within the operator, therefore use with care when
  performing multiple (dec)increments within the same statement line. The
  four operators are defined as follows:

  __&inc__ _variable_ _increment_
  
  >  Pre-increment the _variable_ by _increment_, returning the incremented
     value i.e. _variable_ += _increment_.

  __&dec__ _variable_ _decrement_
  
  >  Pre-decrement the _variable_ by _decrement_, returning the decrement value
     i.e. _variable_ -= _decrement_.

  __&pinc__ _variable_ _increment_
  
  >  Post-increment the _variable_ by _increment_, returning the pre-increment
     value i.e. _variable_++., where the ++ value is determined by _increment_.
     The return value is the value of _variable_ as passed by the caller, the
     next reference to _variable_ uses the _variable_+_increment_ value.

  __&pdec__ _variable_ _decrement_
  
  >  Post-decrement the _variable_ by _decrement_, returning the pre-decrement
     value i.e. _variable_--, where the -- value is determined by _decrement_.


## EXAMPLE


  Add two numbers together and assign to a variable:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable %result &add %num1 %num2

```

  Increment `%result` by 1 and add to `%result2`

```{.emf}
        set-variable %result  &add %result 1
        set-variable %result2 &add %result2 %result

```

  The previous example could have used the increment operators to achieve
  the same result in a single operation e.g.

```{.emf}
        set-variable %result2 &add %result2 &inc %result 1

```

## NAME


  &cat, &lef, &rig, &mid, &len, &slo, &trb - String macro operators


## SYNOPSIS


  __&cat__ _str1_ _str2_  
  __&lef__ _str_ _len_  
  __&right__ _str_ _index_  
  __&mid__ _str_ _index_ _len_

  __&slower__ _str_  
  __&supper__ _str_  

  __&trboth__ _str_  
  __&trleft__ _str_  
  __&trright__ _str_  


## DESCRIPTION


  The string operators operate on character strings (__%__ or __$__ variables),
  performing general string manipulation, returning a string result.

  The operators may all be abbreviated to their three letter abbreviation
  (i.e. __&right__ may be expressed as __&rig__). In all cases the first argument is
  completely evaluated before the second argument.

  __&cat__ _str1_ _str2_
  
  >  Concatenate two string _str1_ with _str2_ to form a new string. i.e.
     _str1str2_

  __&lef__ _str_ _len_
  
  >  Return _len_ leftmost characters from _str_. If _str_ length is shorter than
     _len_ then the string itself is returned. A _len_ of zero returns the
     empty string. A negative _len_ returns all but the 0-_len_ rightmost
     characters from _str_.

  __&rig__ _str_ _index_
  
  >  Returns the rightmost characters of string _str_ from index _index_. This
     function causes some confusion, consider __&lef__ and __&rig__ to be the
     string equivalents of their integer counterparts [&div](&abs(4)) and [&mod](&abs(4)); __&rig__
     returns the remainder of the equivalent __&lef__ function. Invocation with
     _index_ set to zero returns _str_. A negative _index_ returns the 0-_index_
     rightmost characters from _str_.

  __&mid__ _str_ _index_ _len_
  
  >  Extracts a sub-string from string _str_, starting at position _index_ of
     length _len_. A negative _index_ extracts the string starting from 0-_index_
     from the end of _str_ with a length of _len_.

  __&len__ _str_
  
  >  Returns the integer length of the string (number of characters).

  __&slower__ _str_
  
  >  Returns the given string with all upper case characters converted to
     lower case.

  __&supper__ _str_
  
  >  Returns the given string with all lower case characters converted to
     upper case.

  __&trboth__ _str_
  
  >  Returns the given string trimmed of white spaces (i.e. '` `', '`\t`',
     '`\r`', '`\n`', '`\Cl`' and '`\Ck`') from both sides of the string.

  __&trleft__ _str_
  
  >  Returns the given string trimmed of white spaces from the left side of
     the string only.

  __&trright__ _str_
  
  >  Returns the given string trimmed of white spaces from the right side,
     or end, of the string only.

  Evaluation of the strings is left to right, the leftmost argument is fully
  evaluated before the next argument. The operator ordering is prefix
  notation (see [&add(4)](&add(4)) for an example of prefix ordering).


## EXAMPLE


  Concatenate two strings `abc` and `def` together:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable %result &cat "abc" "def"

```

  To concatenate three strings `abc`, `def` `ghi` together:

```{.emf}
        set-variable %result &cat "abc" &cat "def" "ghi"

```

  or, a slightly different ordering:

```{.emf}
        set-variable %result &cat &cat "abc" "def" "ghi"

```
  Retrieve the leftmost character of a string variable, modify the variable
  to contain the remainder.

```{.emf}
        set-variable %foo "abcdef"
        set-variable %c   &lef %foo 1
        set-variable %foo &rig %foo 1

```

  Where `%c` = "`a`"; `%foo` = "`bcdef`" following evaluation.

  To retrieve the characters `cde` into variable `%result` from the string
  "`abcdef`" use:

```{.emf}
        set-variable %result &mid "abcdef" 2 3

```
 
  To retrieve the rightmost character from the string:

```{.emf}
        set-variable %foo "abcdef"
        ; using negative argument
        set-variable %result &rig %foo -1
        ; using &len
        set-variable %result &rig %foo &sub &len %foo 1
        ; using &mid to do the same thing
        set-variable %result &mid %foo -1 1
        set-variable %result &mid %foo &sub &len %foo 1 1

```
 
  To get an input string from the user which is free of spaces at the start
  and end:

```{.emf}
        set-variable %result &trb @ml "Enter string"

```

## NOTES


  The original __MicroEMACS__ "__&rig__ _str_ _n_" function returns the last _n_
  characters from the string _str_ this differs from the definition of __&rig__ in
  this implementation. As most string decomposition is performed left to
  right, and to make __&lef__ and __&rig__ complement each other, the indexing of
  the function has been modified.

## NAME


  &and, &or, &not, &equal, &great, &less - Logical macro operators


## SYNOPSIS


  __&and__ _log1_ _log2_  
  __&or__ _log1_ _log2_  
  __&not__ _log_  

  __&equal__ _num1_ _num2_  
  __&great__ _num1_ _num2_  
  __&less__ _num1_ _num2_  


## DESCRIPTION


  The logical testing operators perform comparison tests, returning a
  boolean value of `TRUE` (1) or `FALSE` (0).

  The functions may all be abbreviated to their three letter abbreviation
  (i.e. __&great__ may be expressed as __&gre__). In all cases the first argument is
  completely evaluated before the second argument. Logical operators
  include:-

  __&and ___log1_ _log2_
  
  >  `TRUE` if the logical arguments _log1_ and _log2_ are both `TRUE`.

  __&or__ _log1_ _log2_
  
  >  `TRUE` if either one of the logical arguments _log1_ and _log2_ are `TRUE`.

  __&not__ _log_
  
  >  Logical NOT. Returns the opposite logical value to _log_.

  The numerical logical functions operate with integer arguments:

  __&equal__ _num1_ _num2_
  
  >  `TRUE`. If numerical arguments _num1_ and _num2_ numerically equal.
     Abbreviated form of the function is __&equ__.

  __&great__ _num1_ _num2_
  
  >  `TRUE`. If numerical argument _num1_ is greater than _num2_. Abbreviated
     form of the function is __&gre__.

  __&less__ _num1_ _num2_
  
  >  `TRUE`. If numerical argument _num1_ is less than _num2_ Abbreviated form of
     the function is __&les__.

  Evaluation of the logical operators are left to right, the leftmost
  argument is fully evaluated before the next argument. The operator
  ordering is prefix notation (see [&add(4)](&add(4)) for an example of prefix
  ordering).


## EXAMPLE


  Test for integers in the range greater than 12:

```{.emf}
        !if &great %i 12
            ...

```

  Test for integers in the range 8-12, inclusive

```{.emf}
        !if &and &great 7 &less 13
            ...

```

## NOTES


  MicroEmacs always evaluates all arguments operators BEFORE the result is
  obtained, this differs from most programming languages. Consider the
  following example:

```{.emf}
        !if &and &bmod "edit" &iseq @mc1 "Save buffer first [y/n]? " "nNyY" "y"
            save-buffer
        !endif

```

  This would not not work as the user may expect, the user would be prompted
  to save every time regardless of whether the buffer has been changed.
  Instead the following should be used:

```{.emf}
        !if &bmod "edit"
            !if &iseq @mc1 "Save buffer first [y/n]? " "nNyY" "y"
                save-buffer
            !endif
        !endif

```

## NAME


  &sprintf - Formatted string construction


## SYNOPSIS


  __&sprintf__ _format_ _args_


## DESCRIPTION


  The __&sprintf__ function (or __&spr__ in it's abbreviated form) provides a
  mechanism to generated a formatted string, similar to the 'C' programming
  language __sprintf(2)__ function. 

  The __&sprintf__ function is generally used where a number of different
  sources of information have to be converted and joined together to form a
  new string. It is possible to do this using [&cat(4)](&cat(4)), but it does become
  complicated if the number of strings to be spliced together is greater
  than about 4, __sprintf__ alleviates these problems and results in faster
  execution. Where only two, or three strings are to be concatenated __&cat__
  provides better execution times.

  The __&sprintf__ function produces a string construct for the _format_ and a
  caller determined number of arguments _args_ (variable arguments). The
  _format_ string may contain special '__%__' formatting commands to insert
  strings and numbers into the base _format_ string. The format for the '__%__'
  commands is "__%nc__" where:-

  __n__
  
  >  An optional numerical argument, the interpretation of the numeric
     value is determined by the following command (__c__).

  __c__
  
  >  The command determines the interpretation of the next argument _arg_
     which are specified as follows:

  > >  __d__ (Decimal integer)
            Expects a single numeric argument arg which is inserted into the
            format string as decimal text string. If n is specified then the
            inserted text string is fixed to n character in length.

  > >  __n__ (Repeat String)
            Expects two arguments arg, the first is a numeric argument giving
            the number of times to insert the given string (the second
            argument). If n is specified then the string is inserted n *
            numeric-argument times.

  > >  __s__ (String)
            Expects a single argument arg which is a string to be inserted
            into the key. If n is given then it is insertedn times.

  > >  __x__ (Hexadecimal integer)
            Expects a single numeric argument arg which is inserted into the
            format string as hexadecimal text string. If n is given then the
            inserted text string will be fixed to n character in length.

  > >  __%__
            Inserts a single '%', n has no effect.

  The __&sprintf__ function may be nested (i.e. a string argument to
  __&sprintf__ may be the result of another __&sprintf__ invocation). Although
  this type of construct is not generally required !!


## EXAMPLE


  The following examples show how the command may be used:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable %result &sprintf "Foo [%s%s]" "a" "b"

```

  generates "`Foo [ab]`"

```{.emf}
        set-variable %result &sprintf "Foo [%n%s]" 10 "a" "b"

```

  generates "`Foo [aaaaaaaaaab]`".

```{.emf}
        set-variable %result &sprintf "[%d] [%3d] [%x] [%3x]" 10 11 12 13

```

  generates "`[10] [ 11] [c] [  d]`"


## NOTES


  It is the callers responsibility to ensure that the correct number of
  arguments is supplied to match the requested formatting string. The
  results are undefined if an incorrect number of arguments are supplied.

  __&nbmode__ _buffer_ _mode_  
  __&inword__ _char_  

  __&indirect__ _str_  

  __&exist__ _str_  


## DESCRIPTION


  These are a selection of miscellaneous functions providing tests and
  exchanging of information.

  The functions may all be abbreviated to their three letter abbreviation
  (i.e. __&indirect__ may be expressed as __&ind__). In all cases the first argument
  is completely evaluated before the second argument.

  __&atoi__ _char_
  
  >  Converts the given character _char_ to it's ASCII number which is
     returned. (see __&itoa__). Abbreviated command is __&ato__.

  __&itoa__ _num_
  
  >  Converts an integer _num_ to it's ASCII character representation which
     is returned to the caller. Abbreviated command is __&ito__.

  __&gmode__ _mode_
  
  >  Returns `1` if the given mode _mode_ is globally enabled. Allows macros to
     test the global mode state (see [Operating Modes](Operating Modes)). Abbreviated command
     is __&gmo__.

  __&bmode__ _mode_
  
  >  Returns `1` if the mode _mode_ is enabled in the current buffer. Allows
     macros to test the state of the buffer mode. Abbreviated command is
     __&bmo__.

  __&nbmode__ _buffer_ _mode_
  
  >  Returns `1` if the mode _mode_ is enabled in buffer _buffer_ . Allows macros
     to test the state of a buffer mode other than the current. Abbreviated
     command is __&nbm__.

  __&inword__ _char_
  
  >  `TRUE`. If the given character _char_ is a 'word' character, see
     [forward-word(2)](forward-word(2)) for a description of a 'word' character. Abbreviated
     command is __&inw__.

  __&indirect__ _str_
  
  >  Evaluate _str_ as a variable. The _str_ argument is evaluated and takes
     the resulting string, and then uses it as a variable name. i.e. a
     variable may reference another variable which contains the data to be
     referenced. Abbreviated command is __&ind__.

  __&exist__ _str_
  
  >  Tests for the existance of _str_ which may be a variable or a
     command/macro name, returning `TRUE` if the variable or command does
     currently exist. Abbreviated command is __&exi__.


## EXAMPLE


  The __&exi__ function is etremely useful in initializing, for example:

```{.emf}
        !if &not &exi %my-init
            ; %my-init is not yet defined so this is the first call
            set-variable %my-init 1
            .
            .

```

  Or in all the [file hooks](fileHooks(2)) a user defined extension is checked for and
  executed if defined:

```{.emf}
        define-macro fhook-c
            .
            .
            ; execute user extensions if macro is defined
            !if &exi my-fhook-c
                my-fhook-c
            !endif
        !emacro

```

  The __&ind__ function deserves more explanation. __&ind__ evaluates its string
  argument _str_, takes the resulting string and then uses it as a variable
  name. For example, given the following code sequence:

```{.emf}
        ; set up reference table

        set-variable  %one "elephant"
        set-variable  %two "giraffe"
        set-variable  %three "donkey"

        set-variable  %index "%two"
        insert-string &ind %index

```
  
  the string "`giraffe`" would have been inserted at the point in the current
  buffer.

  The __&bmode__ invocation allows a calling macro to determine the buffer mode
  state (see [Operating Modes](Operating Modes)). Consider the following example which is a
  macro to perform a case insensitive alphabetic sort using the
  [sort-lines(2)](sort-lines(2)) function. sort-list sorts according to the state of the
  [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) mode, hence the macro has to determine the buffer state in order
  to be able to do the sort.

```{.emf}
        define-macro sort-lines-ignore-case
            set-variable #l0 &bmod exact
            -1 buffer-mode "exact"
            !if @?
                @# sort-lines
            !else
                sort-lines
            !endif
            &cond #l0 1 -1 buffer-mode "exact"
        !emacro

```

  The __&inword__ function is shown in the following example. In this case the
  mouse is positioned over a word. The __&inword__ function is used to determine
  if the cursor is on a valid word character, if so the cursor is placed at
  the start of the word.

```{.emf}
        define-macro mouse-control-drop-left
            set-cursor-to-mouse
            !if &inword @wc
                backward-word
                set-mark
                forward-word
            !else
                ...
            !endif
            copy-region
            set-cursor-to-mouse
        !emacro

```

## NAME


|!emacro
 !emacro - Terminate a macro definition
|!ehelp
 !ehelp - Terminate a help definition


## SYNOPSIS


  [define-macro](define-macro(2)) macro-name

    _... macro body ..._

  __!emacro__
 
  [define-help](define-help(2)) item-name

   _... help body ..._

  __!ehelp__


## DESCRIPTION


  __!emacro__ terminates the storage of an open macro, (opened with
  [define-macro(2)](define-macro(2))). Only the lines between define-macro and the !emacro
  directive comprise the new macro _macro-name_.

  Similarly __!ehelp__ terminates the storage of an open help definition,
  (opened with [define-help(2)](define-help(2))). Only the lines between __define-help__ and the
  __!ehelp__ directive comprise the new help text for item _item-name_.

  __!emacro__ and __!ehelp__ may not be used in any other context.


## EXAMPLE


  For example if a file is being executed contains the text:

```{.emf}
        ;
        ; Read in a file in view mode, and make the window red
        ;
        define-macro view-a-file
            find-file @ml "File to view: "
            1 buffer-mode "view"
            set-variable $buffer-bcol %red
        !emacro

        define-help view-a-file
            This is the help text for the macro view-a-file.
        !ehelp

        ml-write "[view-a-file macro has been loaded]"

```

  then only the lines between the __define-macro__ command and the __!emacro__
  directive are stored in macro _view-a-file_ and the lines between the
  __define-help__ command and the __!ehelp__ directive are stored as help for
  _view-a-file_. The [ml-write](ml-write(2)) line is executed when the file is loaded, and
  the message will appear on the message line, this does not however form
  part of the macro or help.

! 4 !force
## NAME


  !force - Ignore command or macro status


## SYNOPSIS


  __!force__ [_n_] _command_


## DESCRIPTION


  __!force__ ignores the return status of a _command_ while executing a macro.
  When MicroEmacs 2009 executes a macro, if any command fails, the macro is
  terminated at that point. If a line is preceded by a __!force__ directive,
  execution continues whether the command succeeds or not. [$status(5)]($status(5)) may be
  used following __!force__ to determine if the command failed or not.

  A double __!force__ can be used to catch a user termination (via the
  [abort-command(2)](abort-command(2)) bound to C-g). A macro command aborted by the user will
  be terminated even with a single __!force__ directive, but not with two. See
  the example below.

  When specifying a numerical argument with a _command_, it is placed after
  the __!force__ directive and before the _command_ i.e.

```{.emf}
        !force 1 forward-char

```

## EXAMPLE


  The following example shows how __!force__ is used in conjunction with
  __$status__.

```{.emf}
        ; Merge the top two windows

        push-position           ;remember where we are
        1 next-window           ;go to the top window
        delete-window           ;merge it with the second window
        !force pop-position     ;This will continue regardless
        !if $status
            ml-write "Call PASSED"
        !else
            ml-write "Call FAILED"
        !endif
```

  The following example creates an infinite loop that can only be broken out
  of by a user abort. The calling macro catches this by using a double
  !force and continues. This concept is used by commands which take a
  considerable amount of time yet cannot be simply aborted by the user such
  as the spell-checker's best guess list generator.

```{.emf}
        define-macro infinite-loop
            set-variable #l0 1
            !while 1
                ml-write &cat "In loop, C-g to exit: " &pinc #l0 1
            !done
        !emacro

        define-macro catch-abort
            !force !force infinite-loop
            ml-write "You will see this"
        !emacro
```

## NAME


  !if, !elif, !else, !endif, !iif - Conditional statements


## SYNOPSIS


  __!if__ _condition_  
    _... condition body ..._  
  [!elif condition  
     _... condition body ..._  
  ]  
  [!else  
      _... condition body ..._  
  ]  
  __!endif__  

  __!iif__ _condition body_


## DESCRIPTION


  The conditional directives allow statements to be executed only if a
  condition specified in the directive is met, as follows:-

  - Every line following the __!if__ directive, until the first __!elif__, __!else__
        or !endif directive, is only executed if the expression following
        the !if directive evaluates to a TRUE value (non-zero).

  - If the __!if__ evaluates to `FALSE` and a __!elif__ directive is next then the
        expression following the !if is evaluated and following statements
        are executed if TRUE.

  - If no __!if__ or __!elif__ is found to be `TRUE` and a __!else__ is found then the
        statements following it are executed.

  The _condition_ may be any logical condition as evaluated by the
  [Introduction to Variable Functions](variable functions) (e.g. [&equal(4)](&equal(4))) 
  returning `TRUE` or `FALSE`. An integer value, non-zero evaluates `TRUE`, 
  zero evaluates to `FALSE`. A non-numerical  argument, such as a string is always `FALSE`.

  The _conditional body_ may be any __MicroEmacs 2009__ function, macro or
  directive with the exception of __define-macro__ and __!emacro__. All directives
  that alter the execution of the macro are handled correctly within the __!if__
  statement (e.g. [!goto](!goto(4)), [!return](!return(4)) etc.

  __!iif__  provides an optimal way to write an __!if__ statement with exactly
  one body line and no __!elif__ or __!else__ statements.


## EXAMPLE


  The following macro segment creates the portion of a text file
  automatically. (yes believe me, this will be easier to understand then
  that last explanation....)

```{.emf}
        !if &sequal %curplace "timespace vortex"
            insert-string "First, rematerialize\n"
        !endif
        !if &sequal %planet "earth" ;If we have landed on earth...
            !if &sequal %time "late 20th century"  ;and we are then
                ml-write "Contact U.N.I.T."
            !elif &sequal %time "pre 20th century"
                ml-write "start praying for a miracle"
            !else
                insert-string "Investigate the situation....\n"
                insert-string "(SAY 'stay here Sara')\n"
            !endif
        !else
            set-variable %conditions @ml"Atmosphere conditions outside? "
            !if &sequal %conditions "safe"
                insert-string &cat "Go outside......" "\n"
                insert-string "lock the door\n"
            !else
                insert-string "Dematerialize..try somewhere else"
                newline
            !endif
        !endif
        
        ;  The first !if-!endif statement in the above example can be optimised to:- 
        !iif &sequal %curplace "timespace vortex"  insert-string "First, rematerialize\n"
```

## NOTES

  There is a convention in macro code of using 2 spaces to separate the
  _condition_ from the _body_ of an __!iif__ statement making it easier to locate
  the start of the body.

## NAME


|!goto
  !goto - Unconditional labeled jump
|!tgoto
  !tgoto - Conditional labeled jump
$a

## SYNOPSIS


  __!goto__ _label_  
     ...  
  __*___label_  

  __!tgoto__ _condition_ _label_  
     ...  
  __*___label_  


## DESCRIPTION


  Flow can be controlled within a MicroEmacs 2009 macro using the __!goto__
  directive. It takes as an argument a _label_. A _label_ consists of a line
  starting with an asterisk (__*__) and then an alphanumeric label. Only labels
  in the currently executing macro can be jumped to, trying to jump to a
  non-existing label terminates execution of a macro. _labels_ may be located
  at any position within the macro (forwards or backwards from the __!goto__).

  A conditional jump may be implemented with a __!tgoto__, this takes an
  additional argument _condition_, which may be a literal numeric value, a
  variable or an evaluated expression (see [Variable Functions](Introduction to Variable Functions)). If the
  _condition_ evaluates to TRUE (or non-zero) then the branch is taken and
  control continues from the _label_.

  __!tgoto__ is an ideal replacement for [!while(4)](!while(4)) and [!repeat(4)](!repeat(4)) where nested
  loops are required.


## EXAMPLE


  For example, create a block of DATA statements for a BASIC program:

```{.emf}
                insert-string "1000 DATA "
                set-variable %linenum 1000
        *nxtin
                screen-update           ;make sure we see the changes
                set-variable %data @ml "Next number: "
                !if &equal %data 0
                    !goto finish
                !endif
                !if &greater $curcol 60
                    2 backward-delete-char
                    newline
                    set-variable %linenum &add %linenum 10
                    insert-string &cat %linenum " DATA "
                !endif
                insert-string &cat %data ", "
                !goto nxtin
        *finish
                2 backward-delete-char
                newline

```

  Not that any of us are writing basic programs these days !!


## NOTES


  __!goto__ and __!tgoto__ are expensive operations because a symbolic name lookup
  is performed in the macro file. For time critical macros then the [!jump(4)](!jump(4))
  and [!tjump(4)](!tjump(4)) directives should be used as these do not perform a symbolic
  name search. The _jump_ equivalents are source sensitive since a line
  displacement rather than a _label_ is used - this makes them a little
  dangerous to use.

## NAME


  !return, !abort - Exit macro


## SYNOPSIS


  __!return__ [_n_]  
  __!abort__ [_n_]  


## DESCRIPTION


  The __!return__ directive causes the current macro to exit with a `TRUE` status,
  either returning to the caller (if any) or to interactive mode. If an
  argument _n_ is specified then the return status is determined by the value
  of _n_.

  __!abort__ has the same effect as __!return__ only always returning a `FALSE` status
  to halt the execution of any calling macro. If an argument _n_ is given to
  __!abort__ the bell is also rung, the valid values of `n` are the same as for
  the [!bell(4)](!bell(4)) directive.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example checks the current language and warns if it has not
  be set, i.e. `Default`.

```{.emf}
        ; Check the current language

        !if &not &seq %language "Default"
            !return
        !endif
        ml-write "Warning - you have not setup the Language - use user-setup"

```

  The following example is shows the logic of the __!return__ directive:-

```{.emf}
        define-macro i-will-return
            ml-write "you will see me"
            !return
            ml-write "you wont see me"
        !emacro

        define-macro test-return
            ml-write "you will see me"
            i-will-return
            ml-write "you will see me"
        !emacro

```

  Similarly, for the __!abort__ directive

```{.emf}
        ; !abort example
        define-macro i-will-abort
            ml-write "you will see me"
            !abort
            ml-write "you wont see me"
        !emacro

        define-macro test-abort
            ml-write "you will see me"
            i-will-abort
            ml-write "you wont see me"
        !emacro

```

  For the last two examples above, all the "__will__"s are displayed and none of
  the "__wont__"s are.

## NAME


  !while, !continue, !done - Conditional loop


## SYNOPSIS


  __!while__ _condition_  
   ... loop body ...  
  [!continue]  
  __!done__


## DESCRIPTION


  The __!while__ directive allows statements only to be executed if a _condition_
  specified in the directive is met. Every line following the __!while__
  directive, until the first __!done__ directive, is only executed if the
  expression following the __!while__ directive evaluates to a `TRUE` value.

  A __!continue__ may be used in the loop, this immediately returns control to
  the __!while__ statement and skips the rest of the section.

  __!while statement may not be nested.__ That is, only one __!while__ statement may
  be outstanding at a time, a [!repeat(4)](!repeat(4)) statement may be used within the
  __!while__ to create an inner loop if required. Alternatively the [!goto(4)](!goto(4))
  used in conjunction with the [!if(4)](!if(4)) statement may be used to construct
  loops.


## EXAMPLE


  For example, the following macro segment fills to the fill column with
  spaces.

```{.emf}
        !while &less $curcol $buffer-fill-col
            insert-string " "
            !if &equal %example "1"     ; Silly to show continue
                !continue               ; Goto !while
            !endif
            ml-write "You wont see me if %example = 1"
        !done

## NAME


  !repeat, !until - Conditional loop (post testing)


## SYNOPSIS


  __!repeat__  
  ... loop body ...  
  __!until__ _condition_  


## DESCRIPTION


  The __!repeat__ command operates in a similar fashion to [!while/!done](!while(4)) except
  the condition is tested at the end. Control finishes if the condition is
  met. As with the [!while(4)](!while(4)) there is no nesting of multiple __!repeat__
  statements.


## EXAMPLE


  For example, the following macro segment fills to the fill column with
  spaces.

```{.emf}

## NAME


  !bell - Sound audio alarm


## SYNOPSIS


  __!bell__ [_n_]


## DESCRIPTION


  __!bell__ provides a warning (audible or visual) to alert the user of a
  problem. __!bell__ honors the [quiet(5)]($quiet(5)) setting, as such if __quiet__ mode is
  disabled an audible warning is given, otherwise a visual warning is given
  to the user (usually the message "_[BELL]_" in the bottom left hand corner
  of the message line).

  The optional numerical argument _n_ over-rides the current setting of __quite__,
  a value of `0` specifies a quite bell, `2` an audible one, when omitted the
  default is `1` honoring the setting of __quite__ mode.

  __!bell__ is generally used in conjunction with [!abort](!return(4)), the !bell function
  warning the user and the !abort function to quit the macro.


## EXAMPLE


  The following macro example checks for incoming mail and is taken from
  `mail.emf`. If any mail has arrived an audible warning is assured by
  toggling the __quiet__ mode.

```{.emf}
        ;
        ; Mail checker
        define-macro mail-check
            !if &seq &set %vm-mail-src &reg &spr "/history/%s/mail-src"  $platform ""
                ml-write "[Incoming mail file not setup! Execute mail-setup to configure]"
                !abort
            !endif
            600000 create-callback mail-check
            ml-write &spr "Checking for mail in %s..." %vm-mail-src
            set-variable #l0 &cond &gre &stat "s" %vm-mail-src 0 "M" "-"
            !if &not &seq &mid $mode-line 2 1 #l0
                set-variable #l1 &rig $mode-line &cond &seq &mid $mode-line 2 1 "%" 4 3

                !if &seq #l0 "M"
                    ; use an argument to !bell so it toggles it back to its original state
                    !bell 0
                    !bell 2

! 4 MacroArguments
! 4 @?
! 4 @#
! 4 @0
! 4 @1
! 4 @2
! 4 @p
## NAME


  @?, @#, @0, @1, @2, @3, ... @p - Macro arguments


## SYNOPSIS


  __@?__ - Boolean flagging if a numeric argument was supplied  
  __@#__ - The value of the numeric argument  

  __@0__ - The name of the macro  
  __@1__ - The first argument of macro  
  __@2__ - The second argument of macro  
  __@3__ ... __@___n_  

  __@p__ - The name of the calling (or parent) macro.


## DESCRIPTION


  Macros may be passed arguments, allowing a macro to be used by other
  macros. The __@?__ and __@#__ are used to determine the numeric argument given to
  the command. The __@___n_ variable (where _n_ is an integer) used in the context
  of a macro allows the macro body to determine it's arguments.

  From a macro all commands are called in the following form

  [num] <macro-name> "arg1" "arg2" ....


  When executed macros do not have to be given an argument, in this case __@?__
  will be _0_ and __@#__ will be _1_ (the default argument). If an argument is given
  then __@?__ will be _1_ and __@#__ will be set to the numeric argument given.

  The current macro command name _<macro-name>_ can be obtain by using the __@0__
  variable, e.g.

```{.emf}
        define-macro Test-it
            ml-write @0
        !emacro

```

  When executed, writes the message "`Test-it`" which is the name of the
  macro.

  Arguments may be passed into macro commands in the same way as standard
  commands are given arguments. The macro being called can access these by
  the __@1__ to __@n__ variables, where _n_ is a positive integer. Any variables given
  as arguments are evaluated so if the variable name is required then
  enclose it in quotes, e.g.

```{.emf}
        set-variable %test-var "Hello World"

        define-macro Test-it
            ml-write &cat &cat &cat &cat @0 " " @1 " = " &ind @1
            set-variable  @1 @2
        !emacro

        Test-it "%test-var" "Goodbye World"

```

  On execution the macro writes the message

      "`Test-it %test-var = Hello World`"

  and will set variable `%test-var` to "`Goodbye World`". Note that the __@1__ has
  been used by reference on the __set-variable__ rather than by value as it is
  used in an assignment.

  The __@p__ variable can be used to obtain the name of the macro which is
  executing the current macro, i.e. the value of the parent's __@0__ variable.
  If the macro was executed directly by the user then there is no parent
  macro and the value of __@p__ is an empty string ("").

  The variables __@#__ and __@?__ are automatically set on entry to a macro, the
  values may be over-written by the calling macro if required, but their
  assignment values are restricted to being integer values, assignment of a
  character string causes an error.


## DIAGNOSTICS


  If an attempt is made to access an argument which has not been given then
  a error occurs. This error can be trapped using the [!force(4)](!force(4)) directive,
  enabling the macro to take appropriate action, see example.


## EXAMPLE


  Consider the implementation of [replace-all-string(3)](replace-all-string(3)) macro defined in
  search.emf:

```{.emf}
        define-macro replace-all-string
            !force set-variable #l0 @3
            !if &not $status
                set-variable #l1 @ml05 "Replace all"
                set-variable #l2 @ml05 &spr "Replace [%s] with" #l1
                set-variable #l0 @ml00 "In files"
            !else
                set-variable #l1 @1
                set-variable #l2 @2
            !endif
            .
            .
            .
        !emacro

```

  In this example if the 3rd argument is not given then the macro gets all
  arguments from the user.

  The __@p__ variable having a value of "" when a macro is called directly by
  the user can be useful when determining the amount of information to
  feed-back to the user. For example, executing the [clean](clean(3)) macro is an easy
  way to remove surplus white characters, so it is often used by other
  macros as well as by the user. When called directly __clean__ refreshes the
  display and prints a message of completion, but when called by other
  macros this would cause an unwanted screen-update and message, so clean
  only does this when executed by the user. This is done as follows:

```{.emf}
        define-macro clean
            ;
            ; Prepare to clean up file.
            .
            .
            .
            !if &seq @p ""
                screen-update
                ml-write "[Cleaned up buffer]"
            !endif
        !emacro

```

## NOTES


  The parsing of arguments can be inefficient because of the way the
  arguments have to be parsed; to get the 4th argument the 1st, 2nd and 3rd
  arguments must be evaluated. This is because each argument is not
  guaranteed to be only one element, it could be an expression which needs
  to be evaluated. Consider the following invocation of our Test-it macro

```{.emf}
        Test-it &cat "%test" "-var" "Goodbye World"

```

  The 2nd argument is not _"%test"_ as this is part of the first argument, the
  2nd argument is in fact the 4th element and the invocation will have the
  same effect except slower.

! 4 MessageLineVariables

! 4 @mna
! 4 @ml
! 4 @mc
! 4 @mx
! 4 @mxa
## NAME


  @mn, @mna, @ml, @mc, @mx, @mxa - Message line input


## SYNOPSIS


  __@mn__  
  __@mna__  
  __@ml__[_f_][_h_] "_prompt_" ["_default_"] ["_initial_"] ["_com-list_"] ["_buffer-name_"]  
  __@mc__[_f_] _prompt_ [_valid-list_] [_help-string_]  
  __@mx__ "_command-line_"  
  __@mxa__ "_command-line_"


## DESCRIPTION


  The __Message Line Variables__ provide a method to prompt the user for an
  input returning the data to the caller. The __@mn__ variable cause MicroEmacs
  to input data from the user in the default way for that command's
  argument, i.e. the normal prompt with the normal history and completion
  etc. Similarly __@mna__ causes MicroEmacs to input the current argument and
  any subsequent arguments in the default way.

  The __@ml__ variable can be used to get a string (or Line) of text from the
  user using the message-line in a very flexible way. The first optional
  flag __f__ is a bitwise flag where each bit has the following meaning

  `0x01`
  
  >  The _default_ value will be specified and this will be returned by
     default.

  `0x02`
  
  >  The _initial_ value will be specified and this will be initial value
     given on the input line.

  `0x04`
  
  >  Auto-complete using the initial value, usually used with bit `0x02`.

  `0x08`
  
  >  Hide the input string, the characters in the current input string are
     all displayed as `'*'`s.

  If no value is specified then default value is 0 and __h__ can not be
  specified. The _default_ value is returned when the user enters an empty
  string. If the _initial_ string is specified the the input buffer will be
  initialized to the given string instead of and empty one.

  The flag __h__ specifies what type of data is to be entered, this specifies
  the history to be used and the semantics allowed, __h__ can have the following
  values

      `0` For a general string input using the general history.
      `1` For an absolute file name, with completion and history.
      `2` For a MicroEmacs 2009 buffer name, with completion and history.
      `3` For a MicroEmacs 2009 command name, with completion and history.
      `4` For a file name, with completion and history.
      `5` For a search string, with history.
      `6` For a MicroEmacs 2009 mode name, with completion and history.
      `7` For a MicroEmacs 2009 variable name, with completion and history.
      `8` For a general string using no history.
      `9` For a user supplied completion list (`com-list`).
      `a` For a user supplied completion list (`buffer-name`).

  A default value of 0 is used if no value is specified. At first glance
  type 1 and 4 appear to be the same. They differ only when a non absolute
  file name is entered, such as "foobar". Type 1 will turn this into an
  absolute path, i.e. if the current directory is "`/tmp`" then it will return
  "`/tmp/foobar`". Type 4 however will return just "foobar", this is
  particularly useful with the [&find(4)](&find(4)) function to then find the file
  "foobar".

  When a value of `9` is used the argument _com-list_ must be given which
  specifies a list of completion values in the form of a MicroEmacs list
  (see help on [&lget(4)](&lget(4)) for further information on lists). The user may
  enter another value which is not in the list, which will be returned.

  Alternatively a completion list may be given in the form of a buffer using
  a value of `a`. The argument _buffer-name_ must be given to specify the buffer
  name from which to extract the completion list; each line of the buffer is
  taken as a completion value. This option is particularly useful for large
  completion lists as there is no size restrictions.

  The __@mc__ variable can be used to get a single character from the user using
  the message-line. The optional flag __f__ is a bitwise flag where each bit has
  the following meaning

  `0x01`
  
  >  The _valid-list_ specifies all valid letters.

  `0x02`
  
  >  Quote the typed character, this allows keys such as '`C-g`' which is
     bound to the abort command to be entered.

  `0x04`
  
  >  A _help-string_ is given which will be displayed if the user presses
     '`?`'.

  The default value for __f__ is 0. When __@mc__ is used, the user is prompted, with
  the given prompt, for a single character. If a _valid-list_ is specified
  then only a specified valid character or an error can be returned. For
  example, a yes/no prompt can be implemented by the following

```{.emf}
        !if &iseq @mc1 "Are you bored (yn) ? " "yYnN" "y"
            save-buffers-exit-emacs
        !endif

```

  By using the [&isequal(4)](&isequal(4)) operator a return of "Y" or "y" will match with
  "y". However, there are two problems with this, firstly if the user aborts
  by pressing '`C-g`' a macro error will be generated because the __&iseq__
  operator failed to get 2 arguments. The second problem is that the meaning
  of "`(yn)`" may not be obvious to all users so a help string should be
  supplied. To address these 2 issues the following should be used in
  preference:

```{.emf}
        set-variable #l0 @mc5 "Are you bored (?yn) ? " "yYnN" "(Y)es, (N)no, (C-g)Abort ? "
        !if &iseq #l0 "y"
            save-buffers-exit-emacs
        !endif

```

  When the __@mx__ variable is used MicroEmacs sets the system variable
  [$result(5)]($result(5)) to the input prompt, it will then execute the given
  `command-line`. If this command aborts then so does the calling command, if
  it succeeds then the input value is taken from the __$result__ variable.
  Similarly __@mxa__ causes MicroEmacs to get the current and any subsequent
  arguments in this way.

  These variables are useful when trying to use existing commands in a
  different way, such as trying to provide a GUI to an existing command. See
  the __delete-buffer__ example below.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example can be used to prompt the user to save any buffer
  changes, the use of __@mna__ ensures the user will be prompted as usual
  regardless of the number of buffers changed:

```{.emf}
        save-some-buffers @mna

```

  The following example sets `%language` to a language supplied by the user
  from a given list, giving the current setting as a default

```{.emf}
        set-variable %languages "|American|British|French|Spanish|"
        set-variable %language "American"

        set-variable %language @ml19 "Language" %language %languages

```

  The following example is taken from `diff-changes` in tools.emf, it uses __@mc__
  to prompt the user to save the buffer before continuing:-

```{.emf}
        define-macro diff-changes
            !if &seq $buffer-fname ""
                ml-write "[Current buffer has no file name]"
                !abort
            !endif
            !if &bmod "edit"
                set-variable #l0 @mc5 "Save buffer first (?yn) ? " "nNyY" "(Y)es, (N)o, (C-g)Abort ? "
                !if &iseq #l0 "y"
                    save-buffer
                !endif
            !endif
                .
                .

```

  Note that the input is case insensitive. The following version would not
  work as the user may expect when the buffer has not been edited:

```{.emf}
            !if &and &bmod "edit" &iseq @mc1 "Save buffer first (?yn) ? " "nNyY" "y"
                save-buffer
                .
                .

```

  Unlike __C__ and other similar languages MicroEmacs macro language always
  evaluates both __&and__ arguments. This means that the user will be prompted
  to save the buffer regardless of whether the buffer has been edited.

  The __@mx__ variables are useful when using existing commands in a new
  environment. For example, consider providing a GUI for the
  [delete-buffer(2)](delete-buffer(2)) command, when executed the calling GUI may not be aware
  that changes could be lost or a process may still be active. These
  variables can be used as a call back mechanism to handle this problem:

```{.emf}
        define-macro osd-delete-buffer-callback
            !if &sin "Discard changes" $result
                2 osd-xdialog "Delete Buffer" "  Dicard changes?  " 2 10 6 "&Yes" "&No"
                set-variable $result &cond &equ $result 1 "y" "n"
            !elif &sin "Kill active process" $result
                2 osd-xdialog "Delete Buffer" "  Kill active process?  " 2 10 6 "&Yes" "&No"
                set-variable $result &cond &equ $result 1 "y" "n"
            !else
                1000 ml-write &spr "[Unknown prompt %s]" $result
                !abort
            !endif
        !emacro

        define-macro osd-delete-buffer
            .
            . set #l0 to buffer name to be deleted
            .
            delete-buffer #l0 @mxa osd-delete-buffer-callback
        !emacro

```

! 4 @wl
## NAME


  @wc, @wl - Extract characters from the current buffer


## SYNOPSIS


  __@wl__  
  __@wc__


## DESCRIPTION


  Buffer variables allow text to be taken from the current buffer and placed
  into a variable. Two types of extraction are provided __@wl__ provides a line
  extraction method, __@wc__ provides a character extraction method.

  For example, if the current buffer contains the following text:

      Richmond
      Lafayette
      <*>Bloomington                (where <*> is the current point)
      Indianapolis
      Gary
      =* me (BE..) == rigel2 == (c:/data/rigel2.txt) ===================


  The __@wl__ variable allows text from the current buffer to be accessed, a
  command such as:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable %line @wl

```

  would start at the current point in the current buffer and grab all the
  text up to the end of that line and pass that back. Then it would advance
  the point to the beginning of the next line. Thus, after the [set-variable](set-variable(2))
  command executes, the string "`Bloomington`" is placed in the variable __%line__
  and the buffer rigel2 now looks like this:

      Richmond
      Lafayette
      Bloomington
      <*>Indianapolis               (where <*> is the current point)
      Gary
      =* me (BE..) == rigel2 == (c:/data/rigel2.txt) ===================


  The buffer command __@wc__ gets the current character in the buffer, it does
  not change the buffer position. It is important to stress that the cursor
  position is not modified, in general a macro will interrogate the
  character under the cursor and then affect the buffer (i.e. by moving the
  cursor, deleting the character etc.) dependent upon the value of the
  character returned.

  Assignment of the variables causes the buffer contents to be modified,
  deleting the pervious contents and setting the new value. This can be
  useful in certain situations but should be performed with care.


## EXAMPLE


  The __@wc__ variable provides the most useful mechanism to modify the current
  buffer. The following example is a macro called __super-delete__ which is
  bound to `<CTRL-del>`. The macro deletes characters under the cursor in
  blocks. If a white space character is under the cursor then all characters
  up until the next non-white space character are deleted. If a non-white
  space character is under the cursor then all non-white space characters up
  until the next white space character are deleted, then the white space is
  deleted. White space in this context is a `SPACE`, `tab` or `CR` character.

```{.emf}
        ;
        ;---    Macro to delete the white space, or if an a word all of the
        ;       word until the next word is reached.
        ;
        define-macro super-delete
            !while &not &sin @wc " \t\n"
                forward-delete-char
            !done
            !repeat
                forward-delete-char
            !until &or &seq @wc "" &not &sin @wc " \t\n"
            !return
        !emacro

        global-bind-key super-delete "C-delete"

```

## DESCRIPTION


  The Command Variables allow macros to obtain MicroEmacs 2009 input
  commands and keystrokes from the user. The general format of the command
  is:-

  >  __@c___i_[__k__]

  Where,

  _i_ - Determines the source of the input as follows:-

  >  __l__

  > >   The last input entered.

  >  __c__
   
  > >   The current input entered.

  >  __q__
   
  > >   Provides a low level character input mechanism, obtaining a single
        raw character input from the user. The input fetch does not
        interact with the message line and the user is NOT prompted for
        input (use [ml-write(2)](ml-write(2)) to create your own message). @cq is very
        low level, it is generally preferable to use @cg which provides a
        more intelligent binding.

  >  __g__

  > >   Like @cq, @cg[k] gets a single character input, however if the
        input is bound to a function then the function name is returned
        instead of the character e.g. if ^F or <left-arrow> is depressed
        then forward-char is returned. This has distinct advantages over
        @cq as the binding becomes device independent and executes on all
        platforms. In addition, it honors the users bindings, however
        bizarre.

  > __k__

  > >   When, omitted command input is returned to the caller (i.e. the name
        of the command, such as "`forward-char`"). When present, the raw
        keystroke is returned to the caller, i.e. "`^F` (control-F)".

  The __@cl__, __@clk__, __@cc__ and __@cck__ variables can also be set, this feature can be
  used by macros to change the command history. While setting the current
  command is limited in use, setting the last command can be immensely
  useful, consider the following macro code:-

```{.emf}
        kill-line
        forward-line
        set-variable @cl kill-line
        kill-line

```

  Without the setting of the __@cl__ variable, the current kill buffer will
  contain only the last line. But the setting of __@cl__ to kill-line fools
  MicroEmacs into thinking the last command was a kill command so the last
  kill line as appended to the current yank buffer, i.e. the kill buffer
  will have both lines in it.

  This feature can be used for any command whose effect depends on the
  previous command. Such commands include [forward-line(2)](forward-line(2)), [kill-region(2)](kill-region(2)),
  [reyank(2)](reyank(2)) and [undo(2)](undo(2)). This feature should not be abused as unexpected
  things may happen.


## Summary 


  __@cl__
  
  >  Get or set the last command.

  __@clk__
  
  >  Get or set the last key stroke.

  __@cc__
  
  >  Get or set the current command.

  __@cck__
  
  >  Get or set the current keystroke.

  __@cg__
  
  >  Get a command name from the user.

  __@cgk__
  
  >  Get a keystroke from the user.

  __@cq__
  
  >  Get a quoted command name from the user.

  __@cqk__
  
  >  Get a quoted keystroke from the user.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example shows how the __@cc__ and __@cl__ commands are used:-

```{.emf}
        define-macro current-last-command
            insert-string &spr "Last key [%s] name [%s]\n" @clk @cl
            insert-string &spr "Current key [%s] name [%s]\n" @cck @cc
        !emacro

```

  Pressing the up key and then executing this macro using
  execute-named-command (esc x) will insert the lines:-

      Last key [up] name [backward-line]
      Current key [esc x] name [execute-named-command]


  __@cg__ like __@cq__ gets a single character input, however if the keyboard input
  is bound to a function then the function name is returned instead of the
  character e.g. if `^F` or `<left-arrow>` is depressed then __forward-char__ is
  returned. This has distinct advantages over __@cq__ as the binding becomes
  device independent and executes on all platforms, additionally it honors
  the users bindings, however bizarre.

  __@cq__ provides a low level character input mechanism, obtaining a single raw
  character input from the user. This does not interact with the message
  line and the user is not prompted for input (use [ml-write(2)](ml-write(2)) to create
  your own message). __@cq__ is very low level, it is generally preferable to
  use __@cg__ which provides a more intelligent binding.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example is taken from `draw.emf` which uses __@cg__ to obtain
  cursor movements from the user. Note how the input from __@cg__ (stored in
  variable __%dw-comm__) is compared with the binding name rather than any
  keyboard characters.

```{.emf}
            !repeat
                0 screen-update
                !force set-variable #l0 @cg
                !if &seq #l0 "abort-command"
                    !if &iseq @mc1 "Really quit [y/n]? " "nNyY" "y"
                        find-buffer :dw-buf
                        0 delete-buffer "*draw*"
                        -1 buffer-mode "view"
                        !abort
                    !endif
                !elif &seq #l0 "newline"
                    .
                    .
                !elif &seq #l0 "forward-line"
                    1 draw-vert
                !elif &seq #l0 "backward-line"
                    -1 draw-vert
                !elif &seq #l0 "forward-char"
                    1 draw-horz
                !elif &seq #l0 "backward-char"
                    -1 draw-horz
                !elif &seq #l0 "osd"
                    .osd.draw-help osd
                !elif &set #l1 &sin #l0 "mdeu-="
                    !if &les #l1 5
                        set-variable :dw-mode &sub #l1 1
                        set-variable :dw-modes #l0
                        draw-setmode-line
                    !elif &sin #l0 "-="
                        set-variable :dw-char #l0
                        draw-setmode-line
                    !endif
                !else
                    ml-write "[Invalid command]"
                !endif
            !until 0

  Variables - Macro variables


## SYNOPSIS


  __#___tn_  
  __$___variableName_  
  __%___variableName_  
  __.___variableName_  
  __.___commandName___.___variableName_  
  __:___variableName_

## DESCRIPTION


  Variables are part of MicroEmacs macro language and may be used wherever
  an argument is required. The variable space comprises:-

  -  __#__ - Register Variable
  -  __$__ - System Variable
  -  __%__ - Global Variable
  -  __.__ - Command Variable
  -  __:__ - Buffer Variable

  All variables hold string information, the interpretation of the string
  (numeric, string or boolean) is determined when the variable is used
  within the context of the command. There are five types of variable,
  __Register__ __Variables__ (prefixed with a hash __#__), __System Variables__ (prefixed
  with a dollar __$__), __Global Variables__ (prefixed with a percentage __%__), Buffer
  Variables (prefixed with a colon __:__) and __Command Variables__ (prefixed with a
  period __.__).


## Register Variables 


  Register Variables provide a set of 10 prefixed global (__#g0__ .. __#g9__),
  parent (__#p0__ .. __#p9__) and local (__#l0__ .. __#l9__) register variables. The
  interpreted decode time of the register variables is significantly smaller
  than other variable types as no name space search is performed.

  Register variables are assigned using [set-variable(2)](set-variable(2)), their value may be
  queried with [describe-variable(2)](describe-variable(2)), unlike Global Buffer or Command
  variables they cannot be deleted.

  Register variables are implemented like a stack, where the global
  registers are the top of the stack and every executing macro gets its own
  set of resister variables (__#l?__). The macro also has access to the global
  registers (__#g?__) and its calling, or parent macro (__#p?__). If the macro has
  no parent macro then the global registers are also the parent registers.
  Outside macros, i.e. using __set-variable__ manually, the global parent and
  local registers are the same.

  Register variables are typically used for retaining short term state,
  computation steps etc. As with the User Variables, the global register
  variables are global and care must be taken with nested macro invocations
  to ensure that the register usage does not conflict.


## System Variables 


  MicroEmacs defines many System variables which are used to configure many
  aspects of the editors environment. The functionality of each system
  variable has been documented, they can be set and described but cannot be
  unset. If the user attempts to set or describe a non-existent MicroEmacs
  system variable (e.g. __$PATH__) the system environment is used instead,
  allowing the user to query and alter the system environment.


## Global, Command and Buffer Variables 


  The Global variables are denoted by an initial __%__ character followed by the
  name of the variable _variableName_. The _variableName_ may be any ASCII
  character string up to 127 characters in length, all characters of the
  name are significant. Shorter names are preferred as this speeds up
  execution. Global Variables exist in a global context which all macros
  have access to.

  Command variables exist within the scope of a command, they are denoted by
  the period (__.__) character. They can be accessed by one of two forms, either
  __.___variableName_ or __.___commandName___.___variableName_. The first form, without the
  command name, assumes the scope to be the current command, as such may
  only be used to access internal variables. The second form qualifies the
  scope by specifying the command, this form is much more versatile and may
  be used to access any command variable from any other command, e.g.

```{.emf}
        define-macro foo
            set-variable .foo "Hello world"
            1000 ml-write &cat "foo1: " .foo
            1000 ml-write &cat "foo2: " .foo.foo
        !emacro
        define-macro bar
            foo
            1000 ml-write &cat "bar1: " .foo
            1000 ml-write &cat "bar2: " .foo.foo
        !emacro

        bar

```

  When __bar__ is executed the following messages may be observed:-

      foo1: Hello World
      foo2: Hello World
      bar1: ERROR
      bar2: Hello World


  When a macro file or buffer is executed, they are executed within their
  own scope so local scope command variables (form 1) may be created and
  used in that scope. Any such variables created are automatically deleted
  at the end of execution. For example, the default color scheme generator
  macro file, `schemed.emf`, creates command variables for the created colors
  to aid readability:-

```{.emf}
        add-color &set .green     3 0   200 0
        a0dd-color &set .lgreen   11 0   255 0

        ...

        add-color-scheme .scheme.cardback   .lgreen   .green   .lgreen ...

```

  The variables only exist as a file or buffer is being executed, they are
  not accessible by another command once the command or buffer execution has
  finished.

  Buffer variables are similar to Command variable in function and behaviour
  except that their scope is of a buffer and are denoted by the colon (__:__)
  character. Access can be in one of two forms, either __:___variableName_ where
  the scope is assumed to be the current buffer or __:___bufferName___:___variableName_,
  where the scope is explicitly given allowing access to any buffer
  variable, e.g.

```{.emf}
        find-buffer "foo"
        set-variable :foo "Hello world"
        find-buffer "bar"
        set-variable :bar "Hello world"
        1000 ml-write &cat ":foo     " :foo
        1000 ml-write &cat ":foo:foo " :foo:foo
        1000 ml-write &cat ":bar     " :bar
        1000 ml-write &cat ":bar:bar " :bar:bar

```

  When the above is executed the following messages may be observed:-

      :foo     ERROR
      :foo:foo Hello World
      :bar     Hello World
      :bar:bar Hello World


  Global, Buffer and Command variables are automatically defined when they
  are used. A variable is assigned with [set-variable(2)](set-variable(2)) and may be
  subsequently deleted with [unset-variable(2)](unset-variable(2)). The current assignment of a
  variable may be queried from the command line using [describe-variable(2)](describe-variable(2)).
  e.g.

```{.emf}
        define-macro foo
        !emacro
        set-variable %foo "Some string"
        set-variable :bar "Some string"
        set-variable .foo.bar "Some string"

        ...

        ml-write &spr "%s %s %s" %foo :bar .foo.bar

        ...

        unset-variable :bar
        unset-variable %foo
        unset-variable .foo.bar

```

  An undefined variable returns the string `ERROR`, this known state is used
  to advantage with the [hilighting](hilight(2)) initialization, e.g.

```{.emf}
        !if &sequal .hilight.c "ERROR"
            set-variable .hilight.c &pinc .hilight.next 1
        !endif
        ;
        ; Hi-light C Mode
        ;
        0 hilight .hilight.c  2 50             $global-scheme

```

  In this case the variable __.hilight.c__ is explicitly tested for definition,
  if it is undefined then it is assigned a new value.

  Conventionally, names are separated with a minus sign character (__-__) e.g.
  `foo-bar`. It is strongly advised that the name space is kept reasonably
  clean, since there are no restrictions on the number of macros that may be
  defined, problems will arise if different macros use the same variables in
  different contexts. Where possible, Command or Buffer Variables are
  preferable to Global Variables since they have no side effects on other
  macros or buffers. It is advised that all variable names associated with a
  particular macro set are prefixed with short identifier to make the
  variable name space unique. e.g. the __Metris__ macro prefixes all variables
  with __:met-__; the __draw__ macro uses __:dw-__, the __patience__ macro __:pat-__ etc.

  Macro writers should endeavor to use the minimal number of variables,
  obviously the more variables that exist in the system, the greater the
  lookup time to find a variable. Use Register Variables in preference to
  Command, Global or Buffer variables for intimidate computation steps,
  temporary state etc.

  Note that Buffer Variables are automatically deleted when the buffer is
  deleted.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example is the macro to convert tabs to spaces, it is shown
  in two forms, with User Variables and with Register Variables, the
  register variable implementation is obviously preferable since no new
  variables have been defined.


## User Variable Implementation 

```{.emf}

        ;
        ; tabs-to-spaces.
        ; Convert all of the tabs to spaces.
        define-macro tabs-to-spaces
            set-variable %curline $window-line        ; Remember line
            beginning-of-buffer
            !force search-forward "\t"
            !while $status
                3 drop-history
                set-variable %curcol $window-acol
                backward-delete-char
                &sub %curcol $window-acol insert-space
                !force search-forward "\t"
            !done
            3 drop-history
            goto-line %curline
            update-screen
            ml-write "Converted tabs!"
        !emacro

```

## Register Variable Implementation 

```{.emf}

        ;
        ; tabs-to-spaces.
        ; Convert all of the tabs to spaces.
        define-macro tabs-to-spaces
            ; Remember line
            set-variable #l0 $window-line
            beginning-of-buffer
            !force search-forward "\t"
            !while $status
                set-variable #l1 $window-acol
                backward-delete-char
                &sub #l1 $window-acol insert-space
                !force search-forward "\t"
            !done
            goto-line #l0
            screen-update
            ml-write "[Converted tabs]"
        !emacro

```

! 4 MacroNumericArguments
## NAME


  @#, @? - Macro numeric arguments


## SYNOPSIS


  __@#__ - The numerical argument to a macro  
  __@?__ - The truth of the numerical argument to a macro


## DESCRIPTION


  All built-in commands and macros are invoked with a numerical argument.
  The argument is obtained from either the command line when the user
  invokes a command line such as:

  >  __esc 5 esc x forward-char__

  where the argument is entered after [prefix 1](prefix(2)) (__esc__). In this case, causing
  the cursor to be moved forward 5 characters. Within a macro file the same
  operation is defined as:-

  >  __5 forward-char__

  In both cases the numerical argument 5 is passed to the command requesting
  that the resultant operation is performed 5 times in succession before
  returning. The command itself is invoked once, it is the responsibility of
  the command to iterate if requested.

  The command determines how the numerical argument is interpreted, in the
  case of [spell-word](spell-buffer(3)) the argument identifies the type of word that is being
  spelled and NOT the number of words to spell.

  The invocation of named macros operate in the same way, the macro may use
  the variables __@?__ and __@#__ to determine the status of the numerical argument
  passed to it. The variables are interpreted as follows:

  __@?__
  
  >  A logical value defined as `TRUE` (1) if a numerical argument has been
     specified, otherwise `FALSE` (0).

  __@#__
  
  >  A signed integer value of the supplied numeric argument. If no
     argument is supplied (i.e. __@?__==`FALSE`) then __@#__ is set to 1.

  The __@?__ and __@#__ are only valid for the current macro invocation. Other
  macros or commands that are invoked have their own values of __@?__ and __@#__.


## EXAMPLE


  Consider the following example, which sorts lines into alphabetical order
  using the [sort-lines(2)](sort-lines(2)) function. A new command __sort-lines-ignore-case__ is
  created using a macro to sort lines case insensitively regardless of the
  current buffer mode. The command __sort-lines__ takes an optional argument
  which determines which column should be used to perform the sort.

```{.emf}
        ;
        ; sort-lines-ignore-case
        ; Sort lines case insensitively regardless of the current 'exact' mode
        ; setting.
        define-macro sort-lines-ignore-case
            set-variable #l0 &bmod exact
            -1 buffer-mode "exact"
            !if @?
                @# sort-lines
            !else
                sort-lines
            !endif
            &cond #l0 1 -1 buffer-mode "exact"
        !emacro

```

  __@?__ is used to test the presence of the argument, if it is false __sort-lines__
  is invoked without an argument. When true the numeric argument is
  propagated e.g. __@# sort-lines__.

  This particular macro highlights an important consideration when passing
  the numerical argument to other functions, had the macro been implemented
  as:

```{.emf}
        ; INCORRECT IMPLEMENTATION
        define-macro sort-lines-ignore-case
            set-variable #l0 &bmod exact
            -1 buffer-mode "exact"
            @# sort-lines
            &cond #l0 1 -1 buffer-mode "exact"
        !emacro

```

  then when __sort-lines-ignore-case__ is invoked with no arguments __@#__ is
  defined as 1, this is would be incorrectly propagated to __sort-lines__
  causing it to sort on column 1 rather than column 0 as expected.

## NAME


  @y - Yank buffer variable


## SYNOPSIS


  __@y__ - Yank buffer variable


## DESCRIPTION


  The _Yank Buffer Variable_ __@y__ retrieves the current [yank(2)](yank(2)) string from the
  kill buffer and returns it to the caller.

  The __@y__ variable may be set to change the kill ring buffer.

  The _Yank Buffer Variable_ may be specified with a numeric qualifier to
  access one of the historical yank buffers __@y0__ to __@y15__ to directly extract
  text from the kill-ring.


## EXAMPLE


  The current contents of the yank buffer can be obtained using __@y__, so to
  set variable `#l1` to the current or last word if the cursor is not in a
  word, simply use:

```{.emf}
            forward-char
            backward-word
            set-mark
            forward-word
            copy-region
            set-variable #l1 @y

```

! 4 &bor
! 4 &band
! 4 &bxor

## NAME


  &band, &bor, &bnot, &bxor - Bitwise macro operators


## SYNOPSIS


  __&band__ _num1_ _num2_  
  __&bor__ _num1_ _num2_  
  __&bxor__ _num1_ _num2_  
  __&bnot__ _num_


## DESCRIPTION


  The bitwise operators perform bit operations on numeric values returning a
  numerical result of the operation.

  The functions may all be abbreviated to their three letter abbreviation
  (i.e. __&band__ may be expressed as __&ban__). In all cases the first argument is
  completely evaluated before the second argument.

  __&band ___num1_ _num2_
  
  >  Bitwise AND of _num1_ and _num2_ i.e. _num1_ & _num2_.

  __&bor__ _num1_ _num2_
  
  >  Bitwise (inclusive) OR of _num1_ and _num2_ i.e. _num1_ | _num2_.

  __&bxor__ _num1_ _num2_
  
  >  Bitwise (exclusive OR) XOR of _num1_ and _num2_ i.e. _num1_ ^ _num2_.

  __&not__ _num_
  
  >  Bitwise NOT operator of _num_, inverts the state of all bits i.e. ~_num_.

  Evaluation of the bitwise operators are left to right, the leftmost
  argument is fully evaluated before the next argument. The operator
  ordering is prefix notation (see [&add(4)](&add(4)) for an example of prefix
  ordering).

! 4 &cond
## NAME


  &cond - Conditional expression operator


## SYNOPSIS


  __&cond__ _log_ _expr1_ _expr2_


## DESCRIPTION


  The conditional expression __&cond__ provides an alternative way to write
  [!if-!else-!endif](!if(4)) constructs, e.g.:-

```{.emf}
        !if &gre %a %b
            set-variable %z %a
        !else
            set-variable %z %b
        !endif

```

  may be replaced with a conditional expression, breaking down the
  components then

  >  _log_ is __&gre %a %b__  
     _expr1_ is __%a__  
     _expr2_ is __%b__

  rewriting the expression we get:

```{.emf}
        set-variable %z &cond &gre %a %b %a %b

```

  This is far more concise, albeit a little less readable, but does improve
  the performance of macros as there is less information to interpret.

  The __&cond__ operator accepts three fields, ALL fields are evaluated although
  only one of the results _expr1_ or _expr2_ is used. The _log_ field is a logical
  value, if it is non-zero (`TRUE`) then the result of the _expr1_ evaluation is
  used, otherwise the result of _expr2_ is used.

  It should be noted that the conditional expression may be used in any
  construct i.e. [&add(4)](&add(4)), [&cat(4)](&cat(4)), etc. the _expr_ arguments may be strings,
  numbers or booleans the resultant value of the _expr_ arguments is simply
  returned to the calling expression.

! 4 &set
## NAME


  &set - In-line macro variable assignment


## SYNOPSIS


  __&set__ _<var>_ _<expr>_


## DESCRIPTION


  __&set__ performs an in-line macro variable assignment assigning a variable
  _<var>_ the value of the expression _<expr>_, returning the evaluated result
  to the caller. _<expr>_ may be numeric, boolean or a string expression.

  __&set__ is typically used for defining (and simultaneously using) indices
  e.g. as with [add-color(2)](add-color(2)) or [add-color-scheme(2)](add-color-scheme(2)). This is a short-hand of
  [set-variable(2)](set-variable(2)).


## EXAMPLE


  The following example uses __&set__ to define new colors (see `color.emf`):

```{.emf}
        ; Standard colors
        add-color &set %white     0 200 200 200
        add-color &set %black     1 0   0   0
        add-color &set %red       2 200 0   0
        add-color &set %green     3 0   200 0
        add-color &set %yellow    4 200 200 0
        add-color &set %blue      5 0   0   200
        add-color &set %magenta   6 200 0   200
        add-color &set %cyan      7 0   200 200

```

! 4 &find
! 4 &which
## NAME


|&find
  &find - Find a file on the search path

|&which
  &which - Find a program on the path
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __&find__ _<basename>_ _<extension>_  
  __&which__ _<progname>_


## DESCRIPTION


  __&find__ searches for a named file _<basename><extension>_ on the MicroEmacs
  2009 search path defined by the variable [$search-path(5)]($search-path(5)), initialized by
  the system of from the the environment variables [$MEINSTALLPATH(5)]($MEINSTALLPATH(5)) etc.

  Each path component defined in __$search-path__ is prepended to the
  constructed file name and it's existence is tested. If the file exists,
  then the FULL path name of the file is returned to the caller, otherwise
  `ERROR`.

  _<basename>_
  
  >  The base name of the file, excluding any extension.

  _<extension>_
  
  >  The extension of the file name, this must be specified with the
     extension delimiter, typically dot ('`.`'). A `NULL` string (e.g. '`""`')
     may be specified if no extension is required.

  __&which__ searches for the given executable program _<progname>_ on the system
  program search path defined the the environment variable __$PATH__.


## USAGE


  __&find__ is typically used with [insert-file(2)](insert-file(2)) and [find-file(2)](find-file(2)) within macro
  scripts, and is used to locate user specific files.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example uses __&find__ to locate the uses 'C' template file.
  Given a __$search-path__ setting of `/usr/bob/emacs:/usr/local/microemacs`:-

```{.emf}
        insert-file &find "c" ".etf"

```

  Would insert the file `/usr/bob/emacs/c.etf` if it existed, else the file
  `/usr/local/microemacs/c.etf` if it exists.

! 4 !nmacro
## NAME


  !nmacro - Execute line as if not in a macro


## SYNOPSIS


  __!nmacro__ _command_


## DESCRIPTION


  __!nmacro__ causes _command_ to be executed as if it were initiated from the
  command line by the user, rather than from the macro context. When
  MicroEmacs 2009 executes a macro, by default any input the command
  requires is expected on the same line immediately following the command.
  If a line is preceded by a __!nmacro__ (or __!nma__) directive, the command is
  executed as if it was invoked from the command line by the user, as such,
  the rest of the line is ignored and all input is obtained directly from
  the user, as per normal command interaction.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example is taken from macro file `meme3_8.emf` and shows how
  to add a buffer mode.

```{.emf}
        ; Add a buffer mode
        define-macro add-mode
            ; Has the require mode been given as an argument, if so add it
            !force 1 buffer-mode @1
            !if &not $status
                ; No - use 1 buffer-mode to add a mode
                !nma 1 buffer-mode
            !endif
        !emacro

```

  The first line checks that the mode to add has not already been given as a
  macro argument, e.g. by executing the following line

```{.emf}
        buffer-add-mode "view"

```

  If this line fails then the argument was not specified and must be
  obtained from the user as normal.


## NOTES


  Individual arguments may be obtained from the user using the [@mn(4)](@mn(4))
  interactive macro variables.

## NAME


  &cbind, &kbind, &nkind - Command/key binding operators


## SYNOPSIS


  __&cbind__ _key_  
  __&kbind__ _n_ _command_  
  __&nbind__ _key_


## DESCRIPTION


  __&cbind__ returns the command bound to the given key sequence, __&kbind__ can be
  abbreviated to __&kbi__. If the key is not bound then __&kbind__ returns the
  string "_ERROR_".

  __&nbind__ returns the numerical argument associated with the given key
  binding, __&nbind__ can be abbreviated to __&nbi__. If the key is not bound then
  __&nbind__ returns the string "_ERROR_", if the binding has no argument then an
  empty string (`""`) is returned.

  __&kbind__ returns a key sequence bound to the given _command_ with the given
  numerical argument _n_. If no binding can be found then __&kbind__ returns an
  empty string (`""`).


## EXAMPLE


  The following example waits for the user to press a key, then prints what
  command the key is bound to.

```{.emf}
        ml-write "Enter key: "
        set-variable #l0 @cgk
        ml-write &spr "%s is bound to %s" #l0 &cbin #l0

```

## NOTES


  In March 2001 __&kbind__ was renamed __&ckind__ and a new __&nkind__ and __&kbind__ added.

## NAME


  &stat - Retrieve a file statistic


## SYNOPSIS


  __&stat__ _<stat>_ _<filename>_


## DESCRIPTION


  __&stat__ returns the specified _<stat>_ on the given _<filename>_. Valid _<stat>_
  values are:-

  __a__
  
  >  Returns the absolute file name, corrects relative paths and symbolic
     links, i.e. on UNIX if the filename is a symbolic link it returns the
     file name the link points to (recursive), otherwise returns the file
     name.

  __d__
  
  >  Returns the file's modification time stamp as an integer, larger
     values indicate a later time.

  __i__
  
  >  Returns information on the file in a [MicroEmacs list](&ldel(4)) formatted string.
     The fields within the list are defined as follows:

  >  1
            File location, which will be one of the following:

                F   File is an ftp URL file (see note).
                H   File is a http URL link (see note).
                L   File is a local file.


  >  2
            File type, which will be one of the following:

                D   File is a directory.
                H   File is a http URL link (no further information is known).
                L   File is a symbolic link (UNIX).
                N   File is an untouchable system file.
                R   File is a regular file.
                X   File does not exist.


            Note the information returned here is different to the 't' flag
            below as the type of an ftp file is evaluated, i.e. D, R or X will
            be returned.

  >  3
            Symbolic file type, which will be the empty string unless the file
            type above is 'L' in which case it will be one of the following:

                D   File is a directory.
                L   File is a symbolic link (UNIX).
                N   File is an untouchable system file.
                R   File is a regular file.
                X   File does not exist.


  >  4
            File permissions or attributes which are returned as an integer
            value specific to the Operating System.

  >  5 and 6
            File size given as an upper and lower 32 bit integers for large
            file support, these values will be the empty string if the file
            size could not be determined.

            File modification time given as "YYYYMMDDhhmmss", this field has
            not yet been implemented.

  __m__
  
  >  Returns the file's modification time stamp as a string, the format of
     the string is the same as [$time(5)]($time(5)).

  __r__
  
  >  Returns a non-zero value if the user has permission to read the given
     file.

  __s__
  
  >  Returns the size of the file in bytes.

  __t__
  
  >  Returns the type of the file, where values returned are

            X   File does not exist.
            R   File is a regular file.
            D   File is a directory.
            H   File is a http URL link (see note).
            F   File is an ftp URL file (see note).
            N   File is an untouchable system file.


  >  Note that a URL type is determined from the file name, e.g.
     http://..., and its existence is not verified.

  __w__
  
  >  Returns a non-zero value if the user has permission to write to the
     given file.

  __x__
  
  >  Returns a non-zero value if the user has permission to execute the
     given file.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example is a macro which, given a file name, uses __&stat__ to
  check that file file is regular:

```{.emf}
        define-macro test-file
            !force set-variable #l0 @1
            !if &not $status
                set-variable #l0 @ml04 "File name"
            !endif
            !if &not &equ &stat "t" #l4 1
                ml-write &spr "[%s is not a regular file]" #l0
                !abort
            !endif
        !emacro

        test-file "foobar"

```

  The macro can be passed a file name and aborts if the file is not regular,
  there by returning the state.

  The follow example checks that a file is not empty, this is used by
  __mail-check__ to test for any incoming mail.

```{.emf}
            !if &gre &stat "s" %incoming-mail-box
                ml-write "[You have new mail]"
            !endif

```

  &reg - Retrieve a registry value (with default)


## SYNOPSIS


  __&reg__ _root_ _default_


## DESCRIPTION


  __&reg__ retrieves the value of a node defined by _root_ from the registry, this
  is an absolute path.

  The _default_ value is the value of the node to return if the registry node
  does not exist.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example is taken from `me.emf` and uses the registry to
  retrieve some of the default configuration files:

```{.emf}
        ; Load in the color setup
        !force execute-file &reg &spr "/history/%s/color" $platform "color"
        ; execute company setup

## NAME


  &ldel, &lfind, &lget, &linsert, &llen, &lset - List manipulation functions


## SYNOPSIS


  __&ldel__ _list_ _index_  
  __&lfind__ _list_ _value_  
  __&lget__ _list_ _index_  
  __&linsert__ _list_ _index_ _value_  
  __&llen__ _list_
  __&lset__ _list_ _index_ _value_


## DESCRIPTION


  The list manipulation functions perform operations on specially formatted
  strings called lists. A list is defined as:

      "|value1|value2|.....|valueN|"


  Where '`|`' is the dividing character, this is not fixed to a '`|`', but is
  defined by the first character of the string. Following are all valid
  lists.

      "|1|2|3|4|5|"  
      "X1X2X3X4X5X"  
      "\CAHello\CAWorld\CA"  
      "??"  

  The functions may all be abbreviated to their three letter abbreviation
  (i.e. __&linsert__ may be expressed as __&lin__). In all cases the first argument
  is completely evaluated before the second or third argument.

  __&ldel__ _list_ _index_
  
  >  Creates a new list from deleting item _index_ from _list_. If _index_ is out
     of _list_'s range (0 < index <= # items in list) then _list_ is returned
     unchanged.

  __&lfind__ _list_ _value_
  
  >  Returns the index whose item is the same as _value_ in _list_. If _value_ is
     not found in _list_ then "`0`" is returned.

  __&lget__ _list_ _index_
  
  >  Returns the value of item _index_ in _list_. If _index_ is out of _list_'s
     range (0 < index <= # items in list) then an empty string is returned.

  __&linsert__ _list_ _index_ _value_
  
  >  Creates a new list from inserting _value_ into _list_ at point _index_,
     thereby pushing item _index_ to _index_+1 etc.

  >  If _index_ is `0`, _value_ is inserted at the beginning of the list.

  >  If _index_ is `-2`, _value_ is inserted alphabetically (case sensitively)
     into the list.

  >  If _index_ is `-3`, _value_ is inserted alphabetically (case insensitively)
     into the list.

  >  Otherwise, if _index_ is `-1` or greater that the number of items in _list_
     then _value_ is inserted at the end of the list.

  __&llen__ _list_ 
  
  >  Retrieve the length of the list.
    
  __&lset__ _list_ _index_ _value_
  
  >  Creates a new list from setting _index_ of _list_ to _value_. If _index_ is
     out of _list_'s range (0 < index <= # items in list) then __&lset__ behaves
     like __&linsert__ and inserts alphabetically or at the end of the list.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example moves item 4 in a list to position 2:

```{.emf}
        set-variable #l0 &lget %list 4
        set-variable #l1 &ldel %list 4
        set-variable %list &lins #l1 2 #l0

```

  The following example is taken from vm.emf, it firstly checks where the
  user has entered a vm command, if not then the key is execute as normal,
  otherwise the appropriate vm command is executed.

```{.emf}
        define-macro vm-input
            set-variable #l2 @cck
            set-variable #l3 @cc
            !if &not &set #l0 &lfi "|esc h|delete|space|return|A|a|C|c|....|z|" #l2
                !if &not &seq #l3 "ERROR"
                    execute-line &spr "!nma %s %s" &cond @? @# "" #l3
                    !return
                !endif
                ml-write &spr "[Key \"%s\" not bound - \"esc h\" to view help]" #l2
                !abort
            !endif
            set-variable #l1 &lget "|%osd-vm-help osd|vm-del-windows|scroll-down|....
                               ....vm-goto-list|vm-Archive-box|vm-archive-box|....
                               vm-cut-all-data|0 vm-extract-data|...|vm-forward|" #l0
            execute-line #l1
        !emacro

```
## NOTES

  The function __&llen__ was introduced with MicroEmacs 09 version _091224_.

## NAME


 &seq, &iseq, &sle, &sgre, &xseq, &xiseq - String logical macro operators


## SYNOPSIS


  __&sequal__ _str1_ _str2_  
  __&isequal__ _str1_ _str2_  
  __&sless__ _str1_ _str2_  
  __&sgreat__ _str1_ _str2_  

  __&xsequal__ _str1_ _regex_  
  __&xisequal__ _str1_ _regex_  


## DESCRIPTION


  The string logical testing operators perform string comparison tests,
  returning a boolean value of `TRUE` (1) or `FALSE` (0).

  The functions may all be shortened to their three letter abbreviation
  (i.e. __&sequal__ may be expressed as __&seq__). In all cases the first argument
  is completely evaluated before the second argument. String logical
  operators include:-

  __&sequal__ _str1_ _str2_
  
  >  `TRUE` if the two strings _str1_ and _str2_ are the same. Abbreviated form
     of the function is __&seq__.

  __&sless__ _str1_ _str2_
  
  >  `TRUE` if string _str1_ alphabetically less than _str2_. Abbreviated form of
     the function is __&sle__.

  __&sgreat__ _str1_ _str2_
  
  >  `TRUE` if string _str1_ alphabetically larger than _str2_. Abbreviated form
     of the function is __&sgr__.

  __&isequal__ _str1_ _str2_
  
  >  `TRUE` if the two strings _str1_ and _str2_ are the same ignoring letter
     case. Abbreviated form of the function is __&ise__.

  __&xsequal__ _str1_ _regex_
  
  >  `TRUE` if the string _str1_ matches the _regex_ (case sensitive).
     Abbreviated form of the function is __&xse__. See [Regular Expressions](RegularExpressions(2)) for
     information on the _regex_ format.

  __&xisequal__ _str1_ _regex_
  
  >  `TRUE` if the string _str1_ matches the _regex_ (case insensitive).
     Abbreviated form of the function is __&xis__. See [Regular Expressions](RegularExpressions(2)) for
     information on the _regex_ format.

  Evaluation of the string logical operators are left to right, the leftmost
  argument is fully evaluated before the next argument. The operator
  ordering is prefix notation (see [&add(4)](&add(4)) for an example of prefix
  ordering).


## EXAMPLE


  Test for variable [$buffer-bname(5)]($buffer-bname(5)) is equal to `*scratch*`:

```{.emf}
        !if &seq $buffer-bname "*scratch*"
            ...

```

  The following example tests a character is in the range `a`-`z`:

```{.emf}
        !if &not &and &sle %c "a" &sgr %c "z"
            ...

```

  The following example inserts the string "`c`" into the alphabetically order
  string list __%test-list__:

```{.emf}
        set-variable %test-list "|a|b|d|e|"
        set-variable %test-insert "c"

        set-variable #l0 1
        !while &and &not &seq &lget %test-list #l0 "" ...
                ... &sle &lget %test-list #l0 %test-insert
            set-variable #l0 &add #l0 1
        !done
        set-variable %test-list &lins %test-list #l0 %test-insert

```

  The first test on the __!while &and__ conditional checks that the current item
  in the list is not an empty string (""). If it is the end of the list has
  been reached.

  The following example tests the current buffers file name for a ".c"
  extension:

```{.emf}
        !if &xse $buffer-fname ".*\\.c"
            ...

```

  Note the '`\`' character is needed to protect the second '`.`', i.e. so that
  it does not match any character and the second '`\`' is required as the
  string is first parsed by the macro interpreter which changes it to
  "`.*\.c`" which is then interpreted as a regex.

  __&isin__ _str1_ _str2_  
  __&rsin__ _str1_ _str2_  
  __&risin__ _str1_ _str2_


## DESCRIPTION


  These functions test for the existence of _str1_ in _str2_, returning the
  position of the string in _str2_ or 0 if not found.

  The functions may all be abbreviated to their three letter abbreviation
  (i.e. __&risin__ may be expressed as __&ris__). In all cases the first argument is
  completely evaluated before the second argument.

  __&sin__ _str1_ _str2_
  
  >  Returns `0` if string _str1_ does not exists in string _str2_. Otherwise the
     function returns the character position + 1 of the location of the
     first character of the first occurrence of _str1_.

  __&isin__ _str1_ _str2_
  
  >  Returns `0` if case insensitive string _str1_ does not exists in string
     _str2_. Otherwise the function returns the character position + 1 of the
     location of the first character of the first occurrence of _str1_.

  __&rsin__ _str1_ _str2_
  
  >  Returns `0` if string _str1_ does not exists in string _str2_. Otherwise the
     function returns the character position + 1 of the location of the
     first character of the last occurrence of _str1_.

  __&risin__ _str1_ _str2_
  
  >  Returns `0` if case insensitive string _str1_ does not exists in string
     _str2_. Otherwise the function returns the character position + 1 of the
     location of the first character of the last occurrence of _str1_.


## EXAMPLE


  The __&sin__ and similar functions are useful for two different purposes.
  Consider the following example, this utilizes __&sin__ in two different
  contexts. `!while &not &sin @wc " \t\n"` is a test for the end of the
  number, i.e. a white space character (`<tab>`, `<SPACE>` or `<NL>`).

  The invocation `set-variable #l1 &isin @wc "0123456789abcdef"` is subtly
  different. In this case the return value is used to convert the character
  to it's integer hex value by using the value returned by __&isin__.

```{.emf}
        ;
        ; calc-hexnum
        ; Convert the sting from the current position in the buffer
        ; to a hexadecimal number.
        define-macro calc-hexnum
            forward-delete-char
            forward-delete-char
            set-variable #l0 0
            !while &not &sin @wc " \t\n"
                set-variable #l1 &isin @wc "0123456789abcdef"
                !if &not #l1
                    ml-write "Bad Hex number found"
                    !abort
                !endif
                set-variable #l0 &mul #l0 16
                set-variable #l0 &add #l0 &sub #l1 1
                forward-delete-char
            !done
            insert-string #l0
        !emacro

```

  The __&rsin__ function is very similar to sin except the value return is the
  position of the last occurrence of the string in the given string instead
  of the first. This is particularly useful when extracting the path or file
  name from a complete file name. For example, given a UNIX style file name
  such as `"/usr/local/bin/me"` the path can be obtained using set-variable
  %path &lef %pathfile &rsin `"/" %pathfile` and the file name by using
  `set-variable %file &rig %pathfile &rsin` `"/" %pathfile`

! 4 !jump
! 4 !tjump
## NAME


|!jump
 !jump - Unconditional relative branch
|!tjump
 !tjump - conditional relative branch


## SYNOPSIS


  __!jump__ _offset_  
  __!tjump__ _condition_ _offset_


## DESCRIPTION


  Flow can be controlled within a MicroEmacs 2009 macro using the __!jump__
  directive. It takes as a numerical argument _offset_. The _offset_ is a signed
  relative displacement, it may be a literal numeric value, a variable or an
  evaluated expression (see [Variable Functions](Introduction to Variable Functions)). The displacement to jump
  starts from the current __!jump__ line. (i.e. __0 goto__) would loop forever as it
  jumps to itself). Negative _offset_ branches backwards, positive _offset_
  forwards.

  A conditional relative branch, with a numerical displacement is specified
  using __!tjump__. This has an additional argument _condition_ which is evaluated
  and if TRUE (Non-zero) then the branch is taken. The _condition_ may be a
  variable or an evaluated expression.

  __!jump__ and __!tjump__ are fast equivalents of [!goto(4)](!goto(4)) and [!tgoto(4)](!tgoto(4)),
  respectively. __!jump__ should be used with care as these calls are source
  sensitive and unexpected results may be obtained if the _offset_'s are
  specified incorrectly.


## WARNING


  Comments are not counted as valid lines within the relative displacement,
  these are stripped out when the macro is loaded. When using a relative
  branch ensure that ONLY the _code_ lines are counted.


## EXAMPLE


  For some seriously dirty macro tricks then the __!jump__ directive becomes
  very useful. The following example is taken from the __Metris__ macro (which
  is packed with goodies if you can find time to work out what it does !!).
  The following example uses the random number generator [$random(5)]($random(5)) to
  generate a random number which scaled and used as a __!jump__ offset, thereby
  creating a _switch_ type statement.

```{.emf}
        0 define-macro met-select-piece
            !jump &mul 5 &add 1 &div &mod $random 71 10
            set-variable :met-np1 " X "  ; 1st 3 lines are dummies to get offset right

! 4 SearchGroups
! 4 @s0
! 4 @s1
! 4 @s2
## NAME


  @s0, @s1, @s2, ... @s9 - Last search group values


## SYNOPSIS


  __@s0__ - Last search's whole match string  
  __@s1__ - Last search's first group value  
  __@s2__ - Last search's second group value  
  ...  
  __@s9__ - Last search's nineth group value


## DESCRIPTION


  The search group variables __@s___n_ return the string matches of the last
  regular expression search i.e. [search-forward(2)](search-forward(2)) (in [magic(2m)](magic(2m)) mode) or
  [search-buffer(2)](search-buffer(2)).

  __@s0__ returns the whole of the matched string, __@s___n_, _n_ = 1..9, returns the
  bracket matches corresponding to the group demarkation points indicated by
  `\(` and `\)` in the search regular expression.


## DIAGNOSTICS


  An error is generated if an attempt is made to access these variables and
  the last search failed or the last search did not have the specified
  group.

  The value returned for an unused group, e.g. @s2 for the regex string
  "`\(a\)\|\(b\)`" if "`a`" was matched, is an empty string ("").


## EXAMPLE


  The following macro code gives a simple example of their potential use:

```{.emf}
        forward-search "Token *{\\(Start\\|End\\)}"
        !if $status
            ml-write "[found \"%s\"]" @s0
            !if &seq @s1 "Start"
               .
               .

```

## NOTES


  Remember that the regular expression escape character '\' has to be
  duplicated within a macro file as '\' is also the macro file escape
  sequence.

! 4 @fs
! 4 @fss
## NAME


|@fs
 @fs - Frame store variable
|@fss
 @fss - Frame store scheme variable
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __@fs__ _row_ _column_  
  __@fss__ _row_ _column_


## DESCRIPTION


  The frame store variable __@fs__ permits macros to obtain the character
  currently being drawn on the screen at the specified location. If the
  given value of _row_ or _column_ is out range, i.e. less than zero or greater
  than or equal to the screen size (see [$frame-width(5)]($frame-width(5))) then the value
  returned is the empty string (i.e. `""`).

  The frame store scheme variable __@fss__ operates in the same way as __@fs__ but
  returns the hilighting scheme number as opposed to the character.

  These variables cannot be set and are only updated during a screen update,
  this means that macros that change the cursor position need to redraw the
  screen before using this variable (see [screen-update(2)](screen-update(2))).


## EXAMPLE


  The following example gets the word under the current mouse position, this
  may not be the current cursor position:

```{.emf}
        define-macro word-under-mouse
            set-variable #l0 $mouse-y
            set-variable #l1 $mouse-x
            !if &not &inw @fs #l0 #l1
                ml-write "[mouse not over a word]"
                !return
            !endif
            set-variable #l2 @fs #l0 #l1
            set-variable #l1 &sub #l1 1
            !if &inw @fs #l0 #l1
                set-variable #l2 &cat @fs #l0 #l1 #l2
                !jump -3
            !endif
            set-variable #l1 $mouse-x
            set-variable #l1 &add #l1 1
            !if &inw @fs #l0 #l1
                set-variable #l2 &cat #l2 @fs #l0 #l1
                !jump -3
            !endif
            ml-write &spr "[mouse is over the word \"%s\"]" #l2
        !emacro

```

  Knowledge of the display scheme as returned by the __@fss__ variable is a
  little more obscure than the previous example. This variable is currently
  used to determine if there is a spelling error under the cursor position.
  When [auto-spell(3)](auto-spell(3)) is enabled then spelling errors are hilighted in a
  different colour, return of the [hilighting](hilight(2)) scheme allows the caller to
  determine that there is a spelling error at the current position, this
  could also be applied to collapsed regions etc. The following example is
  taken from `mouseosd.emf` to determine if there is a spelling error at the
  mouse position.

```{.emf}
        set-variable #l0 &band $mouse-pos 15
        !if &equ #l0   0
            ; Text window - must goto the original position or cut etc wont work - must dup the position
            0 show-region
            set-variable #l2 $result
            set-variable #l0 20
            osd 27 5  "D"

## NAME


  &opt - MicroEmacs optional feature test


## SYNOPSIS


  __&opt__ _str_


## DESCRIPTION


  This function can be used to test the availability of optional features in
  the current session of MicroEmacs. Some features, like spelling checker
  support, are a compilation option, other options like mouse support may
  also be unavailable on some platforms. The __&opt__ function can be used by
  macros to check that required base functionality is available.

  The function returns `1` in the given feature "_str_" is supported, otherwise
  it returns `0` if the feature is unknown or not supported in the running
  version.

! 4 HistoryGroupVariables
! 4 @h0
! 4 @h1
! 4 @h2
! 4 @h3
! 4 @h4
## NAME


  @h0, @h1, @h2, ... @h4 - History Group Variables.


## SYNOPSIS


  __@h0__ _index_ - General history string  
  __@h1__ _index_ - Buffer history string  
  __@h2__ _index_ - Command history string  
  __@h3__ _index_ - File history string  
  __@h4__ _index_ - Search history string  


## DESCRIPTION


  The history group variables __@h___n_ _index_ return the strings in the history
  buffer ad a given _index_. There are 5 history buffers, _n_, as follows:-

  `0` - General history string  
  `1` - Buffer history string  
  `2` - Command history string  
  `3` - File history string  
  `4` - Search history string  

  Each history buffer contains 20 slots which contain the history
  information. The history slot is selected with the _index_ argument which is
  valid in the range `0..19`, index `0` is the most recent history slot in the
  history group.

  The history slots are automatically modified on the entry of a new
  command, search string etc.

  __@h___n_ _index_ returns the whole of the history string for a given slot.


## DIAGNOSTICS


  An error is generated if an attempt is made to access these variables and
  history buffer identifier _n_ or the _index_ is out of range.


## EXAMPLE


  The last search history may be extracted as follows:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable #l1 @h4 0
        !force search-backward #l1
        !if &not $status
            ; Not found
        !else
            ; Found
        !endif

```

## NOTES


  __@h___n_ was first introduced in the January 2004 release.

! 4 &bstat
## NAME


  &bstat - Retrieve current buffer statistic


## SYNOPSIS


  __&bstat__ _<stat>_


## DESCRIPTION


  __&bstat__ returns the specified _<stat>_ on the current buffer. Valid _<stat>_
  values are:-

  __o__
  
  >  Returns a non-zero value if the buffer is out of date (i.e. the
     original file has changed and is newer than the buffer.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example uses __&bstat__ to determine if the buffer is out of
  date and write a simple message:

```{.emf}
        !if &bstat o
          ml-write "Buffer out of date"
        !endif

! 5 $auto-time
## NAME


  $auto-time - Automatic buffer save time
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$auto-time__ _seconds_; Default is `300` seconds

  0 <= _seconds_ <= t


## DESCRIPTION


  Sets the number of seconds to wait until an edited buffer is auto-saved to
  temporary file to t seconds. A setting of 0 disables the auto-saving
  command. Auto-saving can be enabled and disabled on a per buffer basis
  using buffer mode [autosv(2m)](autosv(2m)).

  The auto-save file naming convention is the same as the backup name only
  using hash ('`#`') instead of tilde ('`~`') and is automatically removed on
  saving a buffer.

  On unlimited length file name systems (UNIX), the following file naming
  conventions are used for file `xxxxx`:

      `xxxxx -> xxxxx#`

  On systems with an `xxxxxxxx.yyy` file name (DOS etc), the following file
  naming conventions are used:

      `xxxxxxxx     -> xxxxxxxx.###`
      `xxxxxxxx.y   -> xxxxxxxx.y##`
      `xxxxxxxx.yy  -> xxxxxxxx.yy#`
      `xxxxxxxx.yyy -> xxxxxxxx.yy#`
 

## NOTES


  The user is warned to be extra careful if files ending in '`~`' or '`#`'s are
  used, it is advisable to disable backup creation (see [global-mode(2)](global-mode(2))) and
  auto-saving (`$auto-time = 0`). The author denies all responsibility (yet
  again) for any loss of data! Please be careful.

  Auto-save files of URL files (i.e. "`ftp://...`" and "`http://...`") are
  written to the system's temporary directory. This avoids potentially slow
  auto-saves. This can however lead to recovery problems as the buffer name
  must be used to avoid auto-saving conflict with other buffers with the
  same base file name but different paths.

! 5 $buffer-scheme
## NAME


  $buffer-scheme - Buffer color scheme.
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$buffer-scheme__ _schemeNum_; Default is `0`


## DESCRIPTION


  __$buffer-scheme__ sets the current buffer's color scheme to _schemeNum_, where
  _schemeNum_ is a color scheme defined with [add-color-scheme(2)](add-color-scheme(2)), which
  identifies the foreground and background color schemes of the buffer. The
  color scheme is initialized to the global color scheme settings (see
  [$global-scheme(5)]($global-scheme(5))) when the buffer is created.

  $buffer-fhook - Buffer macro hook command name (buffer creation)
|$buffer-dhook
  $buffer-dhook - Buffer macro hook command name (buffer deletion)
|$buffer-bhook
  $buffer-bhook - Buffer macro hook command name (buffer current)
|$buffer-ehook
  $buffer-ehook - Buffer macro hook command name (buffer swapped)

## SYNOPSIS


  __$buffer-fhook__ _FunctionName_  
  __$buffer-dhook__ _FunctionName_  
  __$buffer-bhook__ _FunctionName_  
  __$buffer-ehook__ _FunctionName_  


## DESCRIPTION


  Sets the buffer create, delete, begin and end hook command which are
  executed:

  __buffer-fhook__
  
  >  When the buffer is created.

  __buffer-dhook__
  
  >  When the buffer is deleted.

  __buffer-bhook__
  
  >  When the buffer becomes the current buffer.

  __buffer-ehook__
  
  >  When the buffer is swapped out from being the current buffer.

  The variable __$buffer-fhook__ is largely redundant as the file hook is
  executed only once and before it can be sent. Its main use is within
  macros which wish to ascertain what type of buffer it is executing on,
  i.e. if a command was to be executed only on c file then the follow
  ensures that this is the case:

```{.emf}
        !if &not &seq $buffer-fhook "fhook-cmode"
            !abort
        !endif

```

  Where the command _fhook-cmode_ is the c file hook.

  __dhooks__ are executed when a buffer is deleted, but before the contents of
  the buffer are lost. Note that dhooks will not be called if the buffer
  never becomes active, or if MicroEmacs 2009 quits due to the receipt of a
  panic signal.

  __bhooks__ and __ehooks__ are usually used to set and restore global variables
  which require different setting in the current buffer.

  The order of The default settings of these variable are determined by the
  command [add-file-hook(2)](add-file-hook(2)).

## NAME


|$buffer-bname
  $buffer-bname - Name of the current buffer
|$buffer-fname
  $buffer-fname - Name of the current buffer's file name
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$buffer-bname__ _BufferName_
  __$buffer-fname__ _FileName_


## DESCRIPTION


  __$buffer-bname__ the string name of the current buffer. Buffer names are
  unrestricted in length, but must be unique. By default the buffer name is
  derived from the buffer's file name without the path. But this can lead to
  conflicts, caused by identical file names but different paths. In these
  situations a counter is appended to the end of the buffer name and is
  incremented until a unique buffer name is created. For example:

      File Name               Buffer Name
      _______________________________________
 
      /etc/file.c             file.c
      /tmp/file.c             file.c<1>
      /usr/file.c             file.c<2>


  __$buffer-fname__ contains the name of the current buffer's file name complete
  with path.

## NAME


  $buffer-hilight - Define current buffer hilighting scheme.
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$buffer-hilight__ _hilightNum_; Default is `0`

  0 <= _hilightNum_ <= 255


## DESCRIPTION


  __$buffer-hilight__ Sets the current buffer's hi-lighting scheme (see
  [hilight(2)](hilight(2)) for a full description of hi-lighting). The default setting is
  0 which specifies no hi-lighting, when set to a non-zero, the hi-light
  scheme of that number MUST already be defined.

  Terminals that cannot display color directly may still be able to take
  benefit from hi-lighting. A terminal that has fonts can use them in the
  same way using the [add-color-scheme(2)](add-color-scheme(2)) command. The hi-light scheme is
  also used in printing (see [print-buffer(2)](print-buffer(2))). If, however, your terminal
  cannot display color in any way, it is recommended that hi-lighting is
  disabled (except when printing) as it does take CPU time.

## NAME


  $buffer-input - Divert buffer input through macro.
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$buffer-input__ _commandName_


## DESCRIPTION


  __$buffer-input__ allows the buffer input mechanism to be diverted through a
  command macro defined by _commandName_. If this variable is set to a valid
  command, which may be a user defined macro, this command will be called
  instead. The command can access the actual key-code typed by the user via
  the command variable [@cc(4)](@cc(4)), e.g. the following macro prints out the name
  of the command that the user presses until the [abort-command(2)](abort-command(2)) is
  executed.

```{.emf}
        define-macro test-input
            ml-write &spr "Current command: %s" @cc
            !if &seq @cc "abort-command"
                set-variable $buffer-input ""
            !endif
        !emacro

        set-variable $buffer-input test-input

```

  Caution is advised when using this, if there is no way of reseting the
  variable then __MicroEmacs 2009__ must be killed.

$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$buffer-ipipe__ _commandName_


## DESCRIPTION


  __$buffer-ipipe__ allows the buffer incremental pipe input mechanism to be
  diverted through a command macro defined by _commandName_. On a buffer
  running an [ipipe-shell-command(2)](ipipe-shell-command(2)) the command, set by this variable, will
  be called whenever new text has been inserted by the executing process.
  Two _alpha-marks_ will be set in the buffer, '`i`' denotes the start of the
  newly inserted text and '`I`' denotes the end.

! 5 $buffer-mask
## NAME


  $buffer-mask - Current buffer word class mask.
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$buffer-mask__ __string__; Default is `luh`


## DESCRIPTION


  __$buffer-mask__ sets the current buffer word class mask. MicroEmacs 2009 has
  an internal word lookup table which defines whether a given letter is
  considered to be part of a word. This functionality is used in many areas
  such as [forward-word(2)](forward-word(2)), [forward-kill-word(2)](forward-kill-word(2)) hilighting etc. The mask is
  composed with any combination of the following flags, the order in which
  the flags are specified is not important:

  __l__
  
  >  All lower case letters.

  __u__
  
  >  All upper case letters.

  __h__
  
  >  All hexadecimal characters (used to include numerical digits).

  __s__
  
  >  Spell extended characters, typically set to accent (`'`), hyphen (`-`) and
     period (`.`).

  __1__
  
  >  User set __1__, usually set to just underscore (`_`) for many system and
     programming files such as 'C'.

  __2__
  
  >  User set __2__, usually set to '`-`', '`$`', '`&`', '`#`', '`!`', '`%`', '`:`' and '`@`'
     for MicroEmacs files.

  __3__
  
  >  User set __3__, not usually defined.

  __4__
  
  >  User set __4__, not usually defined.

  The character sets may be modified using the [set-char-mask(2)](set-char-mask(2)) command.

## DESCRIPTION


  __$ml-scheme__ defines the color scheme by default on an [osd(2)](osd(2)) dialog, the
  color scheme _schemeNum_ identifies the foreground and background color and
  is defined by an invocation to [add-color-scheme(2)](add-color-scheme(2)). Every osd dialog can
  over-ride this value by using the '_S_' flag.

$a


## SYNOPSIS


  _$cursor-blink_ _integer_; Default is `0`

  _$cursor-color_ _colorNum_; Default is `0`

  0 <= _colorNum_ <= _n_


## DESCRIPTION


  __$cursor-blink__ sets the cursor's flash rate, i.e. the period in which the
  cursor is drawn, hidden and then redrawn. The default setting of 0
  disables cursor blinking. When set to a none zero value the variable is
  split into two componants, the first 16 bits, or lower short, sets the
  cursor visible time in milliseconds, and the higher short sets the hidden
  time. If the hidden time is set to 0 then the cursor will be hidden for
  the same length of time it is visible.

  The cursor blink rate can be setup in the platform section of
  [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)).

  __$cursor-color__ sets the cursor's fore-ground color, and can greatly improve
  cursor visibility. _colorNum_ is a integer palette number created using
  [add-color(2)](add-color(2)), the default is 0.


## PLATFORM


  UNIX termcap interface does not support __$cursor-color__.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example sets the cursor visible time to 600 ms (0x258) and a
  hidden time to 200 ms (0xc8):

```{.emf}
        set-variable $cursor-blink 0x00c80258

! 5 $debug
## NAME


  $debug - Macro debugging flag
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$debug__ _debugLevel_; Default is `0`

  -3 <= _debugLevel_ <= 3


## DESCRIPTION


  __$debug__ is used to control macro debugging, it is a bit based flag where:

  `0x01`
  
  >  Displays an error message when an un-handled exception is encountered,
     this is useful to locate problems in the macro code i.e. missing
     arguments etc. This setting may be used in normal running and macro
     execution is halted when an error is encountered, it is non-intrusive
     up until the point of failure. Enabling slightly slows execution but
     is not typically noticeable on modern processors.

  `0x02`
  
  >  Setting this bit enables the macro debugger. With macro debugging
     enabled, before a line of macro code is executed the line and its
     location is first print on the message line with a prompt allowing the
     user to view variables, abort execution, dive into sub macros etc. The
     behaviour of the macro debugger can be altered by bits `0x04` and `0x08`.

  `0x04`
  
  >  When set all macro lines encountered are printed. When this bit is not
     set only the lines of code that are executed are printed, i.e. if a
     false __!if__ was encountered the lines within the __!if__ would not be
     printed. Problems arise with __!elif__ and __!else__ lines and this bit is not
     set as the __!elif__ and __!else__ lines are never printed.

  `0x08`
  
  >  When set the debug prompt is disabled so the macro line is printed on
     the message line and then immediately executed. This allows the user
     to see the execution flow of the macro code while still executing the
     code at a reasonable pace.

  `0x10`
  
  >  Setting this bit has no immediate effect. However as soon as the key
     bound to [abort-command(2)](abort-command(2)) (typically "`C-g`") is pressed the macro
     debugger is enabled, i.e. bit `0x02` is set. This can be invaluable when
     tracing problems, for example the following macro code will loop
     infinitely:-

```{.emf}
            !repeat
                beginning-of-line
                backward-char
                !force forward-line
            !until &not $status

```

  >  This is a fairly obvious bug, but if buried in a thousand lines of
     macro code it could be very difficult to spot and to find it during
     execution would be very tedious if not impossible. But by setting
     __$debug__ to `0x10` the macro can be executed as normal and as soon as the
     macro is stuck the user can simply press "`C-g`" to start macro
     debugging at the current execution point.

  >  Note that the "`C-g`" which triggers the macro debugger is discarded so
     it does not cause the current command to abort.

  `0x20`
  
  >  Setting this bit is similar to `0x10` except the macro debugger is
     enabled by the ringing of the bell. When some commands fail they
     always print an error message and ring the bell as the error needs
     handling (e.g. missing argument in a __!if__ statement). However if the
     macro has been called with a __!force__ the execution will not be aborted
     so tracing this issue could be difficult without this setting.

## NAME


|$fill-eos
  $fill-eos - Paragraph filling; end of sentence fill characters
|$fill-eos-len
  $fill-eos-len - Paragraph filling; end of sentence padding length
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$fill-eos__ "_string_"; Default is "`.!?`"

  __$fill-eos-len__ _integer_; Default is `1`  
  0 <= _integer_ <= _n_


## DESCRIPTION


  __$fill-eos__ defines the end of sentence character set. Sentences ending in
  these characters are padded with additional _end-of-sentence_ spaces, as
  defined by __$fill-eos-len__.

  __$fill-eos-len__ sets the number of spaces inserted after a full stop during
  paragraph filling. The default is 1 space.

! 5 $file-template
## NAME


  $file-template - Regular expression file search string
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$file-template__ "_string_"; Default is ""


## DESCRIPTION


  __$file-template__ defines a regular expression search string used to identify
  a file in the [grep(3)](grep(3)) and [compile(3)](compile(3)) buffers. The format of the string is
  the same as magic mode search strings (see [search-forward(2)](search-forward(2))).


## EXAMPLE


  A UNIX file name may be considered to contain any ASCII character except a
  space or a '`:`' (used as a divider in many programs). Thus __$file-template__
  should be:

```{.emf}
        set-variable $file-template "[!-9;-z]+"

```

  This will correctly identify "`foo.c`" in the following example.

      foo.c: 45:      printf("hello world\n") ;

## NAME


|$fill-col

|$buffer-fill-col
  $buffer-fill-col - Buffer paragraph mode; right fill column
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$fill-col__ _columnNumber_  
  __$buffer-fill-col__ _columnNumber_  

  -1 <= _columnNumber_ <= 32767 the default is `78`.


## DESCRIPTION


  The __fill-col__ variables specify the position of the right text margin, or
  fill column, when used with [fill-paragraph(2)](fill-paragraph(2)).

  __$fill-col__ defines the global default fill column number, all new buffers
  that are subsequently created assume a fill column value of __$fill-col__.
  _columnNumber_ defaults to 78 when undefined. This value is used in
  conjunction with [justify(2m)](justify(2m)) and [wrap(2m)](wrap(2m)) modes.

  __$buffer-fill-col__ specifies the fill column value to use in a buffer, a
  value of __$fill-col__ is used as a default when the buffer is created.
  Modification of the __$buffer-fill-col__ causes the buffer fill column
  position to be modified, this does not affect any other buffer. The value
  is typically set by the __fhook-xxx__ macro when initializing a buffer using
  the [Language Templates](languageTemplates(2)). __$buffer-fill-col__ may also be modified from
  [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)).

! 5 $box-chars
## NAME


  $box-chars - Characters used to draw lines
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$box-chars__ "_string_"; Default is "`|+++++++++-`"


## DESCRIPTION


  __$box-chars__ is a fixed length string that defines the set of characters
  used to render lines to the screen. [Osd(2)](osd(2)), [directory-tree(2)](directory-tree(2)),
  [list-registry(2)](list-registry(2)) and many macros use these characters as a platform
  independent method of drawing lines. The characters have fixed indices
  defined as follows:-

  Index 0
 
  >  Line joining north to south (vertical line).

  Index 1
 
  >  Line joining south to east.

  Index 2
 
  >  Line joining south to west.

  Index 3
 
  >  Line joining north to east.

  Index 4
 
  >  Line joining north to west.

  Index 5
 
  >  Line joining east to south to west.

  Index 6
 
  >  Line joining north to east to south.

  Index 7
 
  >  Line joining north to east to south to west.

  Index 8
 
  >  Line joining north to south to west.

  Index 9
 
  >  Line joining north to east to south.

  Index 10
 
  >  Line joining east to west.


## EXAMPLE


  The __$box-chars__ is typically platform dependent, it's setting is determined
  by the characters available in character set of the hosting platform.
  MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows environments might use a string such as:-

      "\xB3\xDA\xBF\xC0\xD9\xC2\xC3\xC5\xB4\xC1\xC4"


  X-Windows environments might use a string such as:-

      "\x19\x0D\x0C\x0E\x0B\x18\x15\x0F\x16\x17\x12"


  Both utilize platform specific characters.

## NAME


  $pause-time - Length of time to pause for user
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$pause-time__ _milliseconds_; Default is `2000`

  0 <= _milliseconds_ <= _t_


## DESCRIPTION


  Defines the number of milliseconds to pause, allowing the user to see some
  information. The pause time is used predominantly by the fence match
  operation, determining the time that the opening fence is displayed, see
  [fence(2m)](fence(2m)) mode.

  The __$pause-time__ is also used during the printing of some error messages on
  the message-line. These errors are typically important ones that should
  not be ignored so the system pauses to ensure the user has enough time to
  read them.

## DESCRIPTION


  __$global-scheme__ defines the default buffer color scheme to _schemeNum_, a
  color scheme defined by [add-color-scheme(2)](add-color-scheme(2)). 


## SEE ALSO

! 5 %xgrep-com
## NAME


  %xgrep-com - Grep command line
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __%xgrep-com__ "_string_"; Default is "`grep `"


## DESCRIPTION


  Sets the command line used to execute a __grep(1)__ system command. The output
  of the [xgrep(3)](xgrep(3)) execution should include both file and line number
  information so that the command [get-next-line(2)](get-next-line(2)) can be used properly.
  This is not defined by default and the __xgrep__ command will not execute
  until it is defined.

  __grep(1)__ is typically used with the __-n__ option which produced line numbering
  information which drives the [get-next-line(2)](get-next-line(2)) command.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example shows how the __xgrep__ strings are defined.

```{.emf}
        set-variable %xgrep-com "grep -n "
        0 add-next-line "*grep*"
        add-next-line "*grep*" "%f:%l:"

```

  This definition corresponds to a __grep__ output such as:-

      m5var000.5:13:Sets the  number of seconds to wait
      m5var000.5:14:temporary file to t seconds. A
      m5var000.5:15:Note than the  temporary
      m5var000.5:17:saving a buffer.  Backup  files are
      m5var000.5:24:On unlimited  length  file  name  systems


  where __grep__ produces file and line number information for every match.

  Use [add-next-line(2)](add-next-line(2)) to define the line pattern produced by __grep__. Some
  versions of __grep__ place the file name on a single line matches within the
  file occur on subsequent lines. In this case additional _add-next-line_
  patterns may be defined to cater for the __grep__ output as follows:

```{.emf}
        set-variable %xgrep-com "grep /n "
        0 add-next-line "*grep*"
        add-next-line "*grep*" "File: %f:"
        add-next-line "*grep*" "%l:"

```

  This definition would be used with a __grep__ output such as:-

      File:m5var000.5:
      13:Sets the  number of seconds to wait
      14:temporary file to t seconds. A
      15:Note than the  temporary
      17:saving a buffer.  Backup  files are
      24:On unlimited  length  file  name  systems
      File:m5var001.5:


## NOTES


  __grep(1)__ is a standard utility on UNIX systems. For Windows 95/NT a version
  of GNU __grep__ may be found at:

  >  _<ftp.winsite.com/ftp/pub/pc/winnt/misc/gnugrep.zip>_

  For MS-DOS users, a DJGPP port of __grep__ is also available on the net. A
  commercial version of __grep__ is also available from MKS.

  The MicroEmacs 2009 built in [grep(3)](grep(3)) provides similar functionality and
  does not rely on an external program.

! 5 $home
## NAME


  $home - Users `home' directory location
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$home__ _directory_


## DESCRIPTION


  __$home__ contains the pathname of the users home directory. The file naming
  convention utilizes tilde ('`~`') to identify the users home directory
  (`$HOME`). When entering a file name:

      ~/xxx    -> $home/xxx
      ~yyy/xxx -> $home/../yyy/xxx


  On most systems this is automatically set to the environment variable
  "HOME" if it is defined. On systems (i.e. Microsoft Windows or MS-DOS)
  where there may be no home defined then the system user directory is used
  by default. The value may be explicitly redefined by the user in the
  start-up file to be a different location. If __$home__ is re-defined then
  ensure that a trailing directory separator is included at the end of the
  pathname.

  '`~`' may be used in pathname definitions in the macro files, files but must
  be specified as '`~`', it is perhaps better to use __$home__.

! 5 $scroll
## NAME


  $scroll - Screen scroll control
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  `$scroll` _scrollNum_; Default is `1`  

  0 <= _scrollNum_ <= n


## DESCRIPTION


  __$scroll__ controls the horizontal and vertical scrolling method used to
  display long lines and buffers. The variable is split into two componants,
  the first nibble (`0x0f`) sets the horizontal scroll, and the second nibble
  (`0xf0`) sets the vertical. For the purpose of documentation these parts are
  kept separate, but when setting the variable a single combined value must
  be given.

  The horizontal settings are defined as follows:

  `0x00`
  
  >  Scroll method 0 will only scroll the current line, this is the fastest
     method in execution time.

  `0x01`
  
  >  Scroll method 1 (the default) will scroll the whole page horizontally
     when the [scroll-left(2)](scroll-left(2)) and [scroll-right(2)](scroll-right(2)) commands are used.
     However, when the current line must be scrolled to display the cursor
     due to a [forward-char(2)](forward-char(2)) type cursor movement, only the current line
     is scrolled and the rest are reset.

  `0x02`
  
  >  Scroll method 2 always scrolls the whole page horizontally, keeping
     the cursor in the current column range. If the cursor moves out of
     this range then all the page is scrolled to the new position. This is
     particularly useful when editing long lined tables.

  `0x03`
  
  >  Scroll method 3 fixes the scroll column using the __scroll-left__ and
     __scroll-right__ functions. If the current cursor position is not visible
     in the column range then only the current line is scrolled to the new
     position.

  The vertical settings are defined as follows:

  `0x00`
  
  >  Scroll method 0 (the default) will scroll the current line to the
     middle of the current window whenver it is moved off screen, this is
     the fastest method in execution time.

  `0x10`
  
  >  Scroll method 1 will scroll the current line to the the top of the
     window whenver the current line is moved off the screen using
     [backward-line(2)](backward-line(2)) and to the bottom of the window when [forward-line(2)](forward-line(2))
     is used. This creates the effect of a smooth scroll.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example sets the scrolling method to be the default
  horizontally (`0x01`) and smooth method (`0x10`) vertically :

```{.emf}
        set-variable $scroll 0x11

```

## NAME


|$fill-mode
  $fill-mode - Global paragraph mode; justification method
|$buffer-fill-mode
  $buffer-fill-mode - Buffer paragraph mode; justification method
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$fill-mode__ _justification_  
  __$buffer-fill-mode__ _justification_  

  _justification_ `b` | `c` | `l` | `n` | `o` | `r` | `B` | `C` | `L` | `N` | `R` the default is `N`


## DESCRIPTION


  The __fill-col__ variables specify the text justification modes for text
  filling of [fill-paragraph(2)](fill-paragraph(2)).

  __$fill-mode__ defines the global default justification mode i.e.
  _left_/_right_/_both_/... The default value is _none_ _automatic_ (__N__). The modes
  available are:-

  __b__ Both
  
  >  Enables left and right margin justification.

  __c__ Center
  
  >  Enables center justification.

  __l__ Left
  
  >  Enables left justification.

  __n__ None
  
  >  No filling is performed, adjacent lines are not merged into a single
     line. This subtly different from _left_ justification which fills lines
     to the [$fill-col(5)]($fill-col(5)).

  __o__ One Line
  
  >  Enables the filling of the paragraph to a single line. Typically used
     to prepare a file for transfer to a word processing package.

  __r__ Right
  
  >  Enables right justification.

  __B__ Both (automatic)
  
  >  Automatically determines the mode, defaulting to left and right (both)
     justification.

  __C__ Center (automatic)
  
  >  Automatically determines the mode, defaulting to center justification.

  __L__ Left (automatic)
  
  >  Automatically determines the mode, defaulting to left justification.

  __N__ None (automatic)
  
  >  Automatically determines the mode, defaults to _both_ and not _none_.

  __R__ Right (automatic)
  
  >  Automatically determines the mode, defaulting to right justification.

  __$buffer-fill-mode__ specifies the fill mode value to use in a buffer, a
  value of __$fill-mode__ is used as a default when the buffer is created.
  Modification of the __$buffer-fill-mode__ causes the buffer fill mode to be
  modified, this does not affect any other buffer. The value is set by the
  __fhook-xxx__ macro when initializing a buffer using the [Language Templates](languageTemplates(2)).
  __$buffer-fill-mode__ may also be modified from [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)).

  The buffer lines are automatically justified only when the justification
  mode [justify(2m)](justify(2m)) is enabled. Justification is performed between the left
  and right margins, defined as 0 and [$buffer-fill-col(5)]($buffer-fill-col(5)) respectively.


## Automatic Filling 


  Automatic filling is performed when the mode __$buffer-fill-mode__ is
  specified in upper case. The format of the line (and adjacent lines) is
  interrogated and an _informed_ guess is made as to the expected formating
  which is then adopted. The criteria for automatic formatting is defined as
  follows:-

  _center_
  
  >  If the left and right margins contain the same amount of white space
     +/-1 character then the paragraph is centered.

  _right_
  
  >  If the text commences past half of the [$buffer-fill-col(5)]($buffer-fill-col(5)) (i.e. first
     half of the line comprises white space) AND the line extends to, or
     past, the `$buffer-fill-col` then the paragraph is assumed to be right
     justified.

  _none_
  
  >  If the text commences in column 0 and occupies less than half of the
     line then the paragraph is assumed to be not justified. (i.e. left
     justified, but consecutive lines of the paragraph are not filled)

  _default_
  
  >  If none of the above criteria are met then the default mode is
     adopted, as determined by the lower-case value of the
     __$buffer-fill-mode__ value.

## NAME


  $line-template - Command line regular expression search string

## SYNOPSIS


  __$line-template__ "_string_"; Default is ""


## DESCRIPTION


  __$line-template__ defines a regular expression search string used to identify
  a line number in the [grep(3)](grep(3)) and [compile(3)](compile(3)) buffers. The format of the
  string is the same as magic mode search strings (see [search-forward(2)](search-forward(2))).


## EXAMPLE


  The line number may be considered to contain any numeric number, thus
  __$line-template__ is defined as:

```{.emf}
        set-variable $line-template "[0-9]+"

```

  This correctly identifies "45" in the following __*grep*__ output example:

## DESCRIPTION


  __$mode-line__ defines the format of the mode line printed for every window,
  where the character following a percent ('`%`') has the following effect:-

      `D` Prints the current day.
      `M` Prints the current month.
      `Y` Prints the current year (2 digits).
      `y` Prints the current year (4 digits).
      `b` Prints the current buffer's name.
      `c` Prints the current buffer's column number.
      `e` Prints the current buffer's editing modes.
      `f` Prints the current buffer's file name.
      `h` Prints the current hour of the day.
      `k` Prints the current keyboard macro status.
      `l` Prints the current buffer's line number.
      `m` Prints the current minute of the hour.
      `n` Prints the current buffer's total number of lines.
      `r` Prints the current root user status (UNIX only).
      `s` Prints the horizontal window split character.
      `u` Prints the current buffer's (un)changed or view mode flag.
      `%` Prints a percentage escape character.
      `-` Prints a literal minus character ('`-`') - see NOTES.
      `*` All other characters are printed literally.


## NOTES


  Refer to [$window-chars(5)]($window-chars(5)) for the characters utilized in
  the mode line.  Typically a the '-'  character  is changed to a '=' if it is
  the current window. If a '-' is always required, use "%-".
  
  A buffer can have its own  mode-line,  and be  uneffected be the global mode
  line, see [$buffer-mode-line(5)]($buffer-mode-line(5)).

## NAME

## SYNOPSIS


  __$platform__ "_string_"; Default is platform specific  
  __%platform__ "_string_"; Default is platform specific


## DESCRIPTION


  The __$platform__ variable is a fixed ASCII string used to identify the
  current working platform, attempts to set this variable result in an error
  returned from [set-variable(2)](set-variable(2)).

  Possible values are:

  "__aix__"
  
  >  All IBM AIX O/S.

  "__dos__"
  
  >  All IBM-PCs and compatibles running MS-DOS.

  "__freebsd__"
  
  >  All FreeBSD O/S.

  "__hpux__"
  
  >  All Hewlett Packard's with HP-UX O/S.

  "__irix__"
  
  >  All Silicon Graphics (SGI) IRIX platforms 4.x, 5.x, 6.x.

  "__linux__"
  
  >  All LINUX O/S.

  "__sunos__"
  
  >  All Sun's with SUNOS O/S.

  "__unixwr1__"
  
  >  PC based UNIX platform (Consensus and Unixware).

  "__win32__"
  
  >  Microsoft Windows based systems including Windows 3.x (with Win32s),
     Windows '95 and NT.

  __$platform__ is often used in __.emf__ files to allow portability of macro files
  across platforms, allowing macro files to perform platform specific
  operations. [$system(5)]($system(5)) is also often used for this purpose as its value is
  easier to assess.

  __%platform__ is created at start-up when `me.emf` is executed, its value is
  identical to __$platform__ except when the platform is a console in which case
  a '`c`' is appended to the $platform value, e.g. for MicroEmacs running a
  termcap version on LINUX the value will be "`linuxc`". The variable is used
  when the console and window based versions need to be distinguish, e.g.
  some of the [user-setup](user-setup(3)) settings.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example is taken from the __me.emf__ file which uses the
  __$platform__ variable to load the platform specific initialization files.

```{.emf}
        ;
        ; load in the platform specific stuff
        execute-file $platform

```

  This could be more explicitly done by:

```{.emf}
        ;
        ; load in the platform specific stuff
        !if   &seq $platform "dos"            ; is it an IBM-PC running dos ?
            execute-file "dos"
        !elif &seq $platform "irix"           ; is it an sgi ?
            execute-file "irix"
        !elif &seq $platform "hpux"           ; is it an hp ?
            execute-file "hpux"
            .
            .
        !endif

```

## NOTES


  The __$platform__ variable can not be set. Any attempt to set it will result
  in an error.

! 5 $random
## NAME


  $random - Generate a random number
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  `$random` _integer_  

  0 <= _integer_ <= 65535  


## DESCRIPTION


  The __$random__ variable returns a unique random number in the range 0 - _n_ on
  reference to the variable.

  The random number is derived from the system's random number generator
  (the quality of which is often dubious so try to avoid using the bottom
  bits). Setting this variable with any value resets the random sequence
  using the system time as the seed.

  The range of the random number generator is system dependent. The value is
  typically capped using the [&mod(4)](&mod(4)) arithmetic operator.


## EXAMPLE


  The variable may be assigned to generate a new seed as follows:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable $random 0        ; Set it so we get a new seed

```

  The returned value is used with the __&mod__ operator to limit the value to a
  desired range:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable %random0to9 &mod $random 10

```

## DESCRIPTION


  RCS (Revision Control System) and SCCS (Source Code Control System) are
  programmers source code history data-bases. RCS introduces a system in
  which only one programmer can edit a source file at any one time,
  enforcing some form of stability in the global environment. The fact that
  this interface was developed for the RCS system is irrelevant, and should
  be usable under any other control systems such as SCCS.

  When using RCS, finding a file (see [find-file(2)](find-file(2))) checks for the existence
  of the actual file. If this is not found then it checks for the existence
  of an RCS __$rcs-file__ variable, and if present then it constructs the RCS
  file name and checks for its existence. If this file does not exist then
  it really is a new file and an new buffer is created. If the file does
  exist then the file is checked out using the __$rcs-co-com__ which executes to
  create a file with the original file name, ready for loading.

  __$rcs-file__ is the name of the file when it is fully check in, as opposed to
  when it is ready to be viewed or edited. In RCS, this is usually in the
  `RCS` directory with an appended "`,v`", i.e. for the file `foo.c` in the `/test`
  directory, when fully checked in, the file will not be found at
  "`/test/foo.c`", but at "`/test/RCS/foo.c,v`". When testing for an RCS file,
  the file name is split into two parts, the path name and the file name,
  the path is always inserted at the start, and the file name can inserted
  in the rcs string by using the special "`%f`" token, thus if __$rcs-file__ is
  set to "`RCS/%f,v`", the RCS file name is constructed from "`/test/`" + "`RCS/`"
  + "`foo.c`" + "`,v`".

  If the RCS file is found then the __$rcs-co-com__ (RCS __C__heck __O__ut __COM__mand)
  which is a simple system command line with the exception for `%f` which is
  replaced by the file name, is executed. This is expected to create the
  file (with the correct file name) ready for viewing.

  Once a file is loaded, then the [rcs-file(2)](rcs-file(2)) command has one of two
  effects:-

  >  If the file is in view mode then the __$rcs-cou-com__ (RCS __C__heck __O__ut
     __U__nlock __COM__mand) is executed (system command line using the "%f" as the
     file name). If the RCS file does not exist then is simply toggles the
     view mode, allowing editing.

  >  If the file is not in view mode MicroEmacs attempts to check the file
     back into RCS using either __$rcs-ci-com__ (if the RCS file already
     exists) or the the __$rcs-cif-com__ (RCS __C__heck __I__n __F__irst __COM__mand). The "`%f`"
     is again used for the file name, the "`%m`" can also be used to get a
     comment from the user at check in time which will be inserted (without
     quotes) into the __$rcs-ci-com__ command line. For example, one possible
     __$rcs-ci-com__ setting is "`ci -m\"%m\" %f`" which uses the __ci(1)__ program
     with the __-m__ option to give a check in message.

  If __rcs-file__ is given a negative argument instead of checking in or out the
  current buffer's file it executes the command specified by __$rcs-ue-com__ to
  unedit or abort any changes made to the file. After the command has been
  executed the file is reloaded.


## NOTES


  The RCS variables are by default undefined and must be explicitly enabled
  in the start-up files.


## EXAMPLE


  The following are typical variable definitions for the RCS interface:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable $rcs-file     "RCS/%f,v"
        set-variable $rcs-co-com   "co %f"
        set-variable $rcs-cou-com  "co -l %f"
        set-variable $rcs-ci-com   "ci -u -m\"%m\" %f"

```

  Note that the __$rcs-cif-com__ variable is usually left unassigned and
  __$rcs-ci-com__ is used by default.

  The following are typical variable definitions for the SCCS interface:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable $rcs-file     "SCCS/s.%f"
        set-variable $rcs-co-com   "sccs get %f"
        set-variable $rcs-cou-com  "sccs edit %f"
        set-variable $rcs-ci-com   "sccs delget -y\"%m\" %f"
        set-variable $rcs-ci-com   "sccs create %f"
        set-variable $rcs-ue-com   "sccs unedit %f"

```

  The following variable definitions can be used for MicroSoft's Visual
  Source Safe:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable $rcs-file    "%f"
        set-variable $rcs-cou-com "ss.exe checkout %f"
        set-variable $rcs-co-com  "ss.exe checkout %f"
        set-variable $rcs-ci-com  "ss.exe checkin %f \"-c%m\""

```

  The above definitions can check a file out for edit and commit changes
  back.

## NAME


|$frame-depth
  $frame-depth - Number of lines on the current frame canvas
|$frame-width
  $frame-width - Number of columns on the current frame canvas
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$frame-depth__ _integer_  

  3 <= _integer_ <= 400  

  __$frame-width__ _integer_  

  8 <= _integer_ <= 400  


## DESCRIPTION


  These variables allow the viewable size of the current frame canvas to be
  determined.

  __$frame-depth__ identifies depth of the current frame given as the number of
  character lines. This is the whole frame width, not just what is currently
  visible. The value returned is in the range 3 - _n_, _n_ is system dependent
  but no greater than 400.

  __$frame-width__ identifies the width of the current frame as the number of
  character columns. The value returned is in the range 8 - _n_, _n_ is system
  dependent but no greater than 400.


## NOTES


  The name of these variables changed from __$screen-depth__ and __$screen-width__
  due to the support for multiple frames introduced in April 2002.

! 5 $mouse-pos
## NAME


  $mouse-pos - Mouse position information
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$mouse-pos__ _integer_


## DESCRIPTION


  __$mouse-pos__ is generated by invocation of the command
  [set-cursor-to-mouse(2)](set-cursor-to-mouse(2)). The variable is set to a value that indicates the
  position of the mouse within a window. The values to the mouse
  intersection are interpreted as follows:-

  __0 - Text area__
  
  >  Intersection with the window text area.

  __1 - Message Line__
  
  >  Intersection with the message line.

  __2 - Mode Line__
  
  >  Intersection with the mode line.

  __3 - Horizontal Separator__
  
  >  Intersection with the horizontal window separator. This value is only
     set if a scroll bar is not present.

  __4 - Up Arrow__
  
  >  Intersection with the scroll bar up-arrow character.

  __5 - Upper Shaft__
  
  >  Intersection with the scroll bar upper shaft (above the scroll box).

  __6 - Scroll Box__
  
  >  Intersection with the scroll bar scroll box.

  __7 - Lower Shaft__
  
  >  Intersection with the scroll bar lower shaft (below the scroll box).

  __8 - Down Arrow__
  
  >  Intersection with the scroll bar down-arrow character.

  __9 - Corner__
  
  >  Intersection with the window corner, that is the character at the
     intersection of the scroll bar (or separator) and the mode line.

  __10 - Menu Line__
  
  >  Intersection with the menu line.

  __255 - Error__
  
  >  The position of the mouse could not be determined. This value should
     not arise, if it does then it is an indication that the window
     structure is probably corrupted. A [delete-other-windows(2)](delete-other-windows(2)) is
     suggested or rapid exit from the editor after a [save-some-buffers(2)](save-some-buffers(2))
     command to save any edits (latter option is preferred).

  __Bit 4 - 2nd Column__
  
  >  Bit 4 (16) is set if 2 character column scroll bar or vertical window
     separator is in effect and the cursor exists in the second column This
     value is bitwise OR'ed with the aforementioned intersection values.


## EXAMPLE


  The following macro can be used to print out the current position of the
  mouse, try binding the macro to the "`mouse-move`" key:

```{.emf}
        define-macro print-mouse-position
            !force set-cursor-to-mouse
            set-variable #l0 &band $mouse-pos 15
            !if &equ #l0 0
                ml-write "Mouse in text window"
            !elif &equ #l0 1
                ml-write "Mouse on message line"
            !elif &equ #l0 2
                ml-write "Mouse on Mode line"
            !elif &and &gre #l0 2 &les #l0 10
                ml-write "Mouse on scroll bar"
            !elif &equ #l0 10
                ml-write "Mouse on corner"
            !elif &equ #l0 11
                ml-write "Mouse on menu line"
            !endif
        !emacro

        global-bind-key print-mouse-position mouse-move

```

  __$mouse-pos__ is utilized by the mouse picking code, found in macro file
  `mouse.emf`.

! 5 $status
## NAME


  $status - Macro command execution status
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$status__ _boolean_  

  _boolean_ `TRUE` (1) | `FALSE` (0)


## DESCRIPTION


  __$status__ contains the return status of the last command executed (`TRUE` or
  `FALSE`). __$status__ is generally used with the [!force](!force(4)) directives in macros.


## NOTES


  This variable can not be set, any attempt to set it will result in an
  error.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example shows how the variable is used within a macro
  construct, it converts all tab characters to their SPACE equivalent.

```{.emf}
        ;
        ; tabs-to-spaces.
        ; Convert all of the tabs to spaces.
        define-macro tabs-to-spaces
            ; Remember line
            set-variable #l0 $window-line
            beginning-of-buffer
            !force search-forward "\t"
            !while $status
                set-variable #l1 $window-acol
                backward-delete-char
                &sub #l1 $window-acol insert-space
                !force search-forward "\t"
            !done
            goto-line #l0
            screen-update
            ml-write "[Converted tabs]"
        !emacro

```

  In this case __$status__ monitors the [search-forward](search-forward(2)) command which is
  searching for a tab character. The command returns a status value of `TRUE`
  if a tab is found, otherwise `FALSE`.

  The __!force__ statement prevents the macro from terminating when a `FALSE`
  condition is detected, if omitted the macro would terminate with an error
  as soon as the `FALSE` status is encountered. The definition of
  [tabs-to-spaces(3)](tabs-to-spaces(3)) can be found in format.emf.

## DESCRIPTION


  __$result__ is used to return the results of several commands:

  [buffer-info(2)](buffer-info(2)) - 
     __$result__ is set to the same output string as printed to the
     message-line by this command.

  [change-font(2)](change-font(2)) -
     __$result__ is used to return the user select font when the windows font
     selection dialog is used (Windows systems only).

  [count-words(2)](count-words(2)) -
     __$result__ is set to the same output string as printed to the
     message-line by this command.

  [file-op(2)](file-op(2)) -
     __$result__ is used to return an error code when the command fails.

  [find-registry(2)](find-registry(2)) -
     __$result__ is used to return the name of a registry child node given the
     parent and index from the user.

  [mark-registry(2)](mark-registry(2)) -
     __$result__ is used to return the full name of the given registry node.

  [replace-string(2)](replace-string(2)), 
  [query-replace-string(2)](query-replace-string(2)) -
     __$result__ is used to return the number of substitutions, the final
     replace mode ('a' for all, 'l' for last or 'q' for query) and the
     replace with string in a list.

  [osd(2)](osd(2)) -
     __$result__ is used to give and return information to osd item commands,
     information depends on the type of __osd__ item.

  [osd-dialog(3)](osd-dialog(3))
  [osd-xdialog(3)](osd-xdialog(3)) -
     __$result__ is used to return the button pressed by the user.

  [shell-command(2)](shell-command(2)) -
     __$result__ is set to the exit status of the __system__ call. The combination
     of __shell-command__ calls and return value checking can be used in a
     variety of ways, for example, to test the existence of a file:

```{.emf}
        set-variable %filename @ml "Enter file name"
        shell-command &cat "test -f " %filename
        !if &equ $result 0
            ml-write "file exists"
        !else
            ml-write "file does not exists"
        !endif

```

  [show-region(2)](show-region(2)) -
     __$result__ is set to the current status of the region when an argument of
     _0_ is given to __show-region__.

  [spell(2)](spell(2)) - 
     __$result__ is used to return information on the current word, the
     information depends on the argument given to __spell__.

  [$file-names(5)]($file-names(5)) -
     __$result__ is set to the absolute path of the __$file-names__ query directory
     when the variable is set.

  For more information see the help pages on referenced commands and
  variables.


## NOTES


  The current value of __$result__ is lost on the next command call which uses
  it. As a call to [create-callback(2)](create-callback(2)) can cause the execution of a macro to
  interrupt another which is waiting for user input, the value of __$result__
  should be copied before getting user input.

! 5 $tab-width
## NAME


  $tab-width - Global tab character width
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$tab-width__ _integer_; Default is `8`  

  -0 < _integer_ <= _n_


## DESCRIPTION


  __$tab-width__ defines the default width of a tab character specified in
  spaces. The default value is used when new files are loaded and created
  and seeds the variable [$buffer-tab-width(5)]($buffer-tab-width(5)).

  Setting tabs to arbitrary widths is possible in MicroEmacs 2009 but you
  must be aware of a subtle difference that it makes to your file and hence
  to your editing. When you start MicroEmacs 2009, the tab width is set to
  the default (usually every 8th column) for the tab character (`CTRL-I`). As
  long as you stay with the default, every time you insert the tab
  character, a CTRL-I get inserted. Hence, you logically have a single
  character which might appear to be several spaces on the screen (or the
  output) depending upon the column location of the tab character. This
  means that to remove the spacing you have to delete a _single_ character --
  the tab character.

  On the other hand, the moment you explicitly set the tab interval (even if
  it is to the default value), MicroEmacs 2009 handles the tab character by
  expanding the character into the required number of spaces to move you to
  the appropriate column. In this case, to remove the spacing you have to
  delete the appropriate number of spaces inserted by M-e to get you to the
  right column.

  The operating mode of the tab expansion is controlled by the [tab(2m)](tab(2m)) mode.


## NOTES


  The November 2004 version of MicroEmacs removed the existing variables
  __$tabwidth__ and __$tabsize__ which were ambiguous. The existing variable scope
  was global which caused problems when moving to buffers with different tab
  width properties. The variables have been replaced with __$tab-width__ and
  [$buffer-tab-width(5)]($buffer-tab-width(5)). The indentation which was previously controlled by
  the tab width has been replaced with [$indent-width(5)]($indent-width(5)) and
  [$buffer-indent-width(5)]($buffer-indent-width(5)).

## NAME


  $buffer-tab-width - Buffer tab character interval
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$buffer-tab-width__ `integer`; Default is [$tab-width(5)]($tab-width(5)).  

  -0 < _integer_ <= _n_


## DESCRIPTION


  __$buffer-tab-width__ defines the width of a tab character in terms of
  displayable spaces, a tab character is typically 8 spaces. A tab character
  appearing in a buffer is rendered with up to __$buffer-tab-width__ spaces to
  take it to the next column boundary of modulo __$buffer-tab-width__.

  Modification of the variable value causes the displayed tab width to
  change to the new value. The macro [tabs-to-spaces(3)](tabs-to-spaces(3)) may be used to
  convert all tabs to spaces.

  When a buffer is created (file loading or creation) then the default value
  is taken from the [$tab-width(5)]($tab-width(5)) variable.


## NOTES


  The indentation of a buffer is controlled by the [$buffer-indent-width(5)]($buffer-indent-width(5))
  and not the __$buffer-tab-width__ when automatic [indent(2)](indent(2)) is enabled.

  The November 2004 version of MicroEmacs removed the existing variables
  __$tabwidth__ and __$tabsize__ which were ambiguous. The existing variable scope
  was global which caused problems when moving to buffers with different tab
  width properties. The variables have been replaced with [$tab-width(5)]($tab-width(5)) and
  __$buffer-tab-width__. The indentation which was previously controlled by the
  tab width has been replaced with [$indent-width(5)]($indent-width(5)) and
  [$buffer-indent-width(5)]($buffer-indent-width(5)).

## NAME


|%tag-file
  %tag-file - Tags file name
|%tag-template
  %tag-template - Tag file search string
|%tag-option
  %tag-option - Tag file search option
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __%tag-file__ "_fileName_"  
  __%tag-template__ "_string_"  
  __%tag-option__ "_string_"  


## DESCRIPTION


  The __%tag-file__ and __%tag-template__ variables must be defined for [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2))
  to work, they define the information required to locate tag references.

  __%tag-file__ is the name of the tag file to be used, usually set to "__tags__".
  __%tag-template__ is a regular expression search string used to identify tags
  in a tag file. For example, a tag usually consists of a name "`%[^\t]`"
  followed by a tab "`\t`" followed by the file name that contains the
  function "`%[^\t]`" followed by another tab, followed by the search string
  and end of line "`%[^\n]\n`", i.e.

```{.emf}
        set-variable %tag-template  "%[^\t]\t%[^\t]\t%[^\n]\n"

```

  This would match a __vi(1)__ tag string definition, as created by the UNIX
  utility __ctags(1)__. The tags file typically contains entries such as:-

      $auto-time    m5var000.5 /^.XI $auto-time - "Automatic buffer"$/
      $buffer-bhook m5var002.5 /^.XI $buffer-bhook - "Buffer macro"$/
      $buffer-ehook m5var002.5 /^.XI $buffer-ehook - "Buffer macro"$/


  The __tag-template__ definition is modified to match the output of the
  __ctags(1)__ utility. The format of the tags file may differ from platform to
  platform, typically the differences are encountered in the line contents
  field which is usually defined as `/ .... /` for a forward search tag and ?
  .... ? for a reverse search tag. Note that a tag's search string typically
  starts with the character '`^`' and ends with '`$`' which indicate the start
  and end of the line. The variable fields are expected to be in
  conventional order of _label_, _filename_ and _lineText_.

  __%tag-option__ is a user defined variable that modifies the behavior of
  [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2)). This is defined as a string, where each character identifies
  an option, when undefined then default behavior is assumed. The options
  are defined as:-

  __m__ - Enable multiple tags support
  
  >  Allows a single tag to be present multiple times in the tag file,
     typically used when a function is defined multiple times. When enabled
     __find-tag__ can be used to loop through all definitions of a given tag.

  __r__ - recursive tags file
  
  >  By default, the __tags__ file is assumed to reside in the current
     directory location. The __r__ option enables an ascending search up the
     directory hierarchy from the current directory position in search of a
     recursively generated tags file.

  __c__ - Continue recursive tag search
  
  >  Used in conjunction with flag __r__; when not specified, the recursive
     searching of a tag stops at the first tag file found, regardless of
     whether the given tag was located in the found tag file. If this flag
     is given and the tag was not found in the first tag file, the
     recursive search continues. This allows local tag files to be created
     and regularly maintained, yet still being able to access a higher
     level tag file when required.

  Modifications to this variable should be made in the _user_.emf file, e.g.
  To enable multi recursive ascent tag searching define:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable %tag-option  "mrc"

```

## NOTES


  Note that GNU Emacs uses it's own tag file format generated by __etags(1)__
  which does not contain the appropriate information to drive the MicroEmacs
  2009 __find-tag__ command.

  The above settings should support the extended version 2 tag file format
  which has an extra tag type field at the end of each line.

! 5 $timestamp
## NAME


  $timestamp - Time stamp string
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$timestamp__ "_string_"; Default is "`<%Y%M%D.%h%m>`"


## DESCRIPTION


  __$timestamp__ defines the file time-stamping string. MicroEmacs 2009 searches
  for, and modifies, the string to the current time and date whenever the
  file is saved (written to disk) and [time(2m)](time(2m)) mode is enabled.

  Time stamp string is defined, by default, as "`<%Y%M%D.%h%m>`". The first
  occurrence of the string in the file is up-dated with the time and date
  information when the buffer is written. The __$timestamp__ string may contain
  any text, and includes the following, magic characters escaped by a
  percentage (``%`') character:-

      `D` - Day.
      `M` - Month.
      `Y` - Year.
      `h` - Hour.
      `m` - Minute.
      `s` - Second.

  The format string may be redefined into any format. The '`%`' character has
  to be delimited by another '`%`' if it is to be used in the text (i.e.
  "`%%`").

  The year component (`%Y`) may be a 2 or 4 digit string, depending whether it
  includes the century. When the time stamping searches for the `%Y` component
  it searches for either variant and replaces appropriately.


## EXAMPLE


  The startup file may define the time stamp required as follows:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable $timestamp "Last Modified : %Y/%M/%D %h:%m:%s"

```

  Time stamping is performed on the string :-

       Last Modified : 90/11/23 10:12:01


  Where the time stamp is modified according to the file (buffer) type then
  the time stamp string may be modified within the buffer hooks. This allows
  different files to utilize different time stamping strings. The following
  example shows how the entry and exit buffer hooks are defined to modify
  the string:

```{.emf}
        0 define-macro bhook-nroff
            set-variable .timestamp $timestamp
            ; Buffer specific time stamp string.
            set-variable $timestamp "[%Y/%M/%D %h:%m:%s]"
        !emacro
        0 define-macro ehook-nroff
            ; Restore the existing time stamp.
            set-variable $timestamp .bhook-nroff.timestamp
        !emacro

```

  On entry to the buffer (buffer becomes current) the buffer hook
  __bhook-nroff__ is executed which stores the current setting and then modifies
  the time stamp string. On exit from the buffer the buffer hook __ehook-nroff__
  is executed restoring the time stamp string.

## NAME


|$window-mode-line
  $window-mode-line - Window mode line position
|$window-scroll-bar
  $window-scroll-bar - Window scroll bar (or separator) position
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$window-mode-line__ _integer_  

  1 <= _integer_ <= [$frame-depth]($frame-depth(5)) - 2  

  __$window-scroll-bar__ _integer_  

  0 <= _integer_ <= [$frame-width]($frame-depth(5)) - 1  


## DESCRIPTION


  __$window-mode-line__ stores the screen line of the current windows mode-line,
  where screen lines are counted from 0 at the top of the screen. Often used
  in conjunction with [set-cursor-to-mouse(2)](set-cursor-to-mouse(2)) and [$mouse-y(5)]($mouse-y(5)) to add more
  complex mouse functionality.

  __$window-scroll-bar__ stores the screen position of the right-hand horizontal
  window separator line or scroll-bar (see [split-window-horizontally(2)](split-window-horizontally(2)) and
  [$scroll-bar(5)]($scroll-bar(5))). A value of greater than [$frame-width(5)]($frame-width(5)) indicates that
  there is no right-hand separator column or scroll bar present. Often used
  in conjunction with [$mouse-x(5)]($mouse-x(5)).


## EXAMPLE


  In the following example the position of the mouse is checked to see if it
  is on the mode line of the window, if so then a different action is taken.

```{.emf}
        set-cursor-to-mouse
        ;   If we are on the mode line then interpret position of
        ;   the cursor on line to control the screen.
        !if &equal $window-mode-line $mouse-y
            !if &less $mouse-x "2"
                menu-main     ; Inform buffer to pop up menu.
            !elif &equal $mouse-x "2"
                delete-window
            !elif &equal $mouse-x "3"
                delete-other-windows
            !elif &equal $mouse-x "4"
                backward-page
            !elif &equal $mouse-x "5"
                forward-page
            !elif &equal $mouse-x "6"
                recenter
            !elif &equal $mouse-x "7"
                undo

! 5 $system
## NAME


  $system - System configuration variable
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$system__ _bitmask_; Default is system dependent


## DESCRIPTION


  The __$system__ is used to define and configure the MicroEmacs environment, it
  is a bit based flag where:-

  __0x001__
  
  >  This bit is set if MicroEmacs is running in Console mode. On UNIX
     systems the default is to use X whenever possible, in which case this
     bit will be clear. If X is not used then a TERMCAP base interface is
     used instead and this bit will be set (see notes below on how to set
     which interface to use). On all other systems this bit will be clear.

  __0x002__
  
  >  If this bit is set then the current system supports definable RGB
     colors allowing any color to be created and used in a [color scheme](add-color(2)).
     This bit cannot be set, typically Windows and UNIX X-Windows systems
     support this.

  __0x004__
  
  >  If this bit is set then the current system supports ANSI colors (8
     colors, black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan & white), bits
     0x002 and 0x004 are mutually exclusive. On UNIX systems if the TERMCAP
     interface is being used then this bit can be changed to (de)select the
     used of color. Many unix terminals do not support color so this should
     be set appropriately. On all other systems this bit cannot be changed
     and MS-DOS is currently the only other system to use ANSI colors.

  __0x008__
  
  >  If this bit is set then the current system supports Extended ANSI
     colors, brighter versions of the 8 ANSI colors doubling the number of
     colors available to 16. On UNIX systems if the TERMCAP interface is
     being used then this bit can be changed to (de)select the used of bold
     with color to create this extended color set for foreground colors.
     But many UNIX terminals do not support this use of color with the bold
     font so this should be set appropriately. On all other systems this
     bit cannot be changed and MS-DOS is currently the only other system to
     support this.

  __0x010__
  
  >  If this bit is set then the current system supports the use of fonts
     (bold, italic, light and underline). Whether these fonts can be
     successfully utilized depends upon the platform and the system font
     being used, for UNIX TERMCAP systems it will also depend on the
     terminal being used. This option is not supported on MS_DOS.

  __0x020__
  
  >  When this bit is set the cursor is always shown in OSD (main menu)
     dialogs, this helps to improve navigation of dialogs ion systems with
     limited colors.

  __0x080__
  
  >  This bit is set if the current system is a UNIX based system such as
     LINUX or HPUX. This bit cannot be altered, its use is within macros.

  __0x100__
  
  >  This bit is set if the current system is a Microsoft based system such
     as DOS or Windows '95. This bit cannot be altered, its use is within
     macros.

  __0x200__
  
  >  If this bit is set then the current system uses the concept of drives
     (i.e. `c:/` on DOS systems). This bit cannot be altered, its use is
     within macros.

  __0x400__
  
  >  If this bit is set then a DOS style `8.3` file naming system should be
     used (i.e. "`BBBBBBBB.XXX`"), otherwise an unlimited file name length is
     used. This effects the backup and auto-save file names generated by
     MicroEmacs, the bit can be altered on systems that support unlimited
     file name length.

  __0x800__
  
  >  If this bit is set then the current system supports and uses
     [ipipe-shell-command(2)](ipipe-shell-command(2)) when required. For systems such as DOS which
     cannot support ipipes, this bit will be clear and cannot be altered.
     For systems which do support ipipes, this bit can be cleared to
     disable their use.

  __0x1000__
  
  >  If this bit set, the then execution of the [tab(2)](tab(2)) command (bound to
     `tab`) always checks and adjusts the indentation of the current line
     when the current buffer has an [indentation](indent(2)) method. If the bit is clear
     then the `tab` may only checks the indentation when the cursor is in
     column zero depending on the setting of bit __0x200000__.

  __0x2000__
  
  >  If this bit is set the main menu Alt hot-key bindings are enabled.
     These are dynamic bindings automatically generated from the main menu.
     Typically the first item in the main menu is "`File`" with a hot key of
     '__F__', with this bit set '`A-f`' will open this menu item. Note that
     global and local key bindings override these. Also see bit __0x4000__.

  __0x4000__
  
  >  If this bit is set the Alt key acts as a [prefix 1](prefix(2)) modifier key. By
     default '`A-n`' is not bound, with this bit set the key is inferred to
     '`esc n`' which is bound to __forward-paragraph__. Note that global, local
     and menu hot-key bindings override these. Also see bit 0x2000.

  __0x8000__
  
  >  If this bit is set the [undo](undo(2)) history is kept after a save allowing the
     [undo(2)](undo(2)) command to back-up changes beyond the last save. When clear
     the undo history is discarded after the buffer is saved.

  __0x10000__
  
  >  Enable box character rendering fix, supported on Win32 and XTerm
     interfaces only. Windows ANSI fonts and many XTerm ISO-8859-1 fonts do
     not have well formed box characters which are used by [osd(2)](osd(2)) and other
     commands to create a better looking interface. When this bit is
     enabled MicroEmacs traps the printing of characters with an ASCII
     value of less than 32 and renders them directly. Following is a table
     of supported characters, other characters in the range of `0x00` to `0x1f`
     not listed are rendered as a space:

            0x08
                Special Character; Backspace

            0x09
                Special Character; Tab

            0x0b
                Box Character; Bottom right

            0x0c
                Box Character; Top right

            0x0e
                Box Character; Bottom left

            0x0f
                Box Character; Center cross

            0x10
                Arrows; Right

            0x11
                Arrows; Left

                Box Character; Horizontal line

            0x15
                Box Character; Left Tee

            0x16
                Box Character; Right Tee

            0x17
                Box Character; Bottom Tee

            0x18
                Box Character; Top Tee

            0x19

            0x1e
                Arrows; Up

            0x1f
                Arrows; Down

  __0x20000__
  
  >  Enables the client server, default is disabled (UNIX and Win32 NT or
     Win95+ platforms only). When enabled a hidden "`*server*`" buffer is
     created which monitors commands written to the server, the socket
     "`/tmp/mesrv`__uid__" on UNIX systems and the command input file
     "__$TEMP__`/me`__$MENAME__`.cmd`" on Win32 systems. Commands can be written out
     using the command [ipipe-write(2)](ipipe-write(2)) while in the "*server*" buffer, the
     command is written to the same socket on UNIX systems and to the
     response file and response file "__$TEMP__`/me`__$MENAME__`.rsp`" on Win32
     systems. This functionality is used by the __-m__ and __-o__ [command-line](me(1))
     options and by the [MicroSoft DevStudio](memsdev(1)) interface.

  __0x40000__
  
  >  Enables the capture of the Alt space key ("`A-space`"), default is
     enabled (Win32 platform only). In the Windows environment the Alt
     Space key is used to activate the main window's pull down menu at the
     top left. if this bit is set MicroEmacs captures this key and executes
     it as normal, thereby disabling this standard windows binding.

  __0x80000__
  
  >  Enables the drawing of visible white spaces, i.e. space, tab and
     new-line characters. When disabled (default) white spaces are drawn
     using spaces ('` `') which means the user cannot distinguish between a
     tab and spaces or determine the last character of the line by merely
     looking at the display. When enabled MicroEmacs uses visible
     characters to draw the white spaces, the characters used are set with
     the variable [$window-chars(5)]($window-chars(5)).

  __0x100000__
  
  >  Enables hiding MicroEmacs generated backup files. On Windows and Dos
     platforms the Hidden file attribute is used to hide the file, whereas
     on UNIX the backup file name is prepended with a '`.`'.

  __0x200000__
  
  >  If this bit set, the then execution of the [tab(2)](tab(2)) command (bound to
     `tab`) checks and adjusts the indentation of the current line when the
     cursor is in column zero and current buffer has an [indentation](indent(2)) method.
     The setting of this bit has no effect if bit __0x1000__ is set. If this
     and bit __0x1000__ are clear then the `tab` will not check the indentation.

  __0x400000__
  
  >  When this bit is set the external clipboard (Windows & XTerm
     platforms) will never be set to empty, if the current yank buffer is
     the empty string the cut buffer will be set to a space (i.e. " ").
     This feature has been added to avoid problems with other software
     (e.g. __exceed(1)__ which can crash if given an empty cut buffer).

  __0x800000__
  
  >  When this bit is set all use of the external clipboard (Windows &
     XTerm platforms) is disabled, this means that MicroEmacs will not
     attempt to retrieve or set the content of the system clipboard.

  __0x1000000__
  
  >  When this bit is set the `-p` or `-P` option was used on the command line
     (see [me(1)](me(1))). This bit can be used by macros to determine how to
     function, see [filetype(3f)](filetype(3f)) for an example of its use.


## EXAMPLE


  The follow example works out the current buffer's backup file name using
  __$system__ to determine the naming system being used by MicroEmacs:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable #l0 &stat "a" $buffer-fname
        ; Is an 8.3 dos style naming system being used?
        !if &band $system 0x400
            !if &not &set #l1 &sin "." #l0
                set-variable #l1 &cat #l0 ".~~~"
            !elif &gre &set #l1 &sub &len #l0 #l1 2
                set-variable #l1 &cat &lef #l0 &sub &len #l0 1 "~"
            !else
                set-variable #l1 &spr "%s%n" #l0 &sub 3 #l1 "~"
            !endif
        !elif $kept-versions
            set-variable #l1 &cat #l0 ".~0~"
        !else
            set-variable #l1 &cat #l0 "~"
        !endif

```

  The following macro can be used to toggle the visible drawing of white
  spaces:

```{.emf}
        define-macro toggle-visible-white-spaces
            set-variable $system &bxor $system 0x80000
            screen-update
        !emacro

```

## NOTES


  Most of the __$system__ functionality can be set using the [$user-setup(3)](user-setup(3))

  By default, on X supporting systems MicroEmacs creates a new X window.
  This feature may be disabled in one of two ways:

  - The environment variable `$TERM` is set to "`vt...`", in this case it is
          assumed that the machine is a server, and the host cannot support X.
  - The `-n` option is used on the command line (see [me(1)](me(1))) to disable the
          windowing interface.

  If X is disabled then the __termcap__ interface is used instead, still
  allowing the use of colors through the ANSI standard, or the use of fonts
  (see bits __0x004__ and __0x008__).

  X provides the following features over and above a __termcap__ based version
  of MicroEmacs 2009:

  - R,G,B style color creator giving access to up to 256 different
          colors for the ultimate hilighting schemes (see bit 0x002 and
          [add-color(2)](add-color(2))).
  - Full mouse support, allowing user definable bindings to every mouse
          event (see [global-bind-key(2)](global-bind-key(2))).
  - Copy from and pasting to X's selection buffer (see [yank(2)](yank(2))).

## SYNOPSIS


  __$window-col__ _integer_ [0 <= _integer_ <= 65535]  
  __$window-line__ _integer_ [1 <= _integer_ <= n]  
  __$window-acol__ _integer_ [0 <= _integer_ <= n]  
  __$window-aline__ _integer_ [1 <= _integer_ <= n]  
  __$window-eline__ _integer_ [1 <= _integer_ <= n]  
  __$window-mark-col__ _integer_ [0 <= _integer_ <= 65535]  
  __$window-mark-line__ _integer_ [1 <= _integer_ <= n]  


## DESCRIPTION


  __$window-col__ is defined as the current position of the cursor in the
  current line in the current window. Column zero is the left hand edge.
  This differs from __$window-acol__ in that TAB and special characters only
  count for 1 character. __$window-col__ is valid in the range 0 - _n_.

  __$window-acol__ is defined as the current column of the cursor in the current
  window. Column zero is the left hand edge. This differs from __$window-col__
  in that tab and special characters may not count for 1 character.

  __$window-line__ is defined as the current buffer line number the cursor is on
  in the current window. Line numbering starts from 1. __$window-line__ is valid
  in the range 1 - _n_.

  __$window-aline__ is identical to __$window-line__ except when the current buffer
  contains narrowed out sections before the current line. In this case
  __$window-line__ will be set to the line number without counting the number of
  lines in the narrow, whereas __$window-aline__ will return the current line
  number including all lines narrowed out before it. When this variable is
  set, the line required may lie in a narrowed out section in which case the
  narrow is automatically removed. See [narrow-buffer(2)](narrow-buffer(2)) for more information
  on narrowing.

  __$window-eline__ is the end line of the window, that is the line number of
  the last line of the buffer showing in the window. This is a useful value
  for mouse operations when the position of the mouse may be tested to
  ensure that the mouse position is within the valid text region of the
  buffer.

  __$window-mark-line__ is the current buffer line number of the mark position
  of [set-mark(2)](set-mark(2)) in the current window. Line numbering starts from 1.
  __$window-mark-line__ is valid in the range 1 - _n_.

  __$window-mark-col__ is the current buffer column of the mark position of
  [set-mark(2)](set-mark(2)) in the current window. Note that this is the actual column
  position in the line which may be different from the window column
  position as TAB and special characters only count as a single character.


## NOTES


  Variable __$window-wcol__ was renamed to __$window-acol__ in June 2000. Variable
  __$window-wline__ was also removed and a new variable __$window-y-scroll__
  introduced at this time. The following macro code can be used to calculate
  the value of the original __$window-wline__ variable:

  __$window-mark-line__ and __$window-mark-col__ first appeared in the 2006 release
  of MicroEmacs.

  The following code retrieves the current line on the screen:
  
```{.emf}
        set-variable #l0 &sub &sub $window-line $window-y-scroll 1

```

! 5 %ftp-flags
## NAME


|%ftp-flags
  %ftp-flags - "Configure the FTP console"
|%http-flags
  %http-flags - "Configure the HTTP console"
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __%ftp-flags__ "[`c`|`s`|`p`]" ; Default is undefined.  
  __%http-flags__ "[`c`|`s`|`p`]" ; Default is undefined.  


## DESCRIPTION


  The __%ftp-flags__ and __%http-flags__ modify the behavior of the editor during
  FTP and HTTP file transfers, respectively. (see [ftp(3)](ftp(3)) and [find-file(2)](find-file(2))).

  By default, the flags are disabled, the facilities outlined below are
  enabled by setting the variable in the user configuration. The flag values
  for both flags are defined as follows:-

  __c__
  
  >  Create a console buffer (`*ftp-console*` for ftp, `*http-console*` for
     http) into which the FTP/HTTP command interactions with the remote
     server are logged.

  __s__
  
  >  Show the console whenever a FTP/HTTP operation is performed. The
     console is popped into the display pane and shows the current
     interaction status.

  __p__
  
  >  Show the download progress within the console window ('`#`' for every
     2Kb downloaded)

  Typically the following flags are enabled in the _user_.emf file:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable %ftp-flags "csp"
        set-variable %http-flags "csp"

```

  Once familiar with this facility the console pop-up becomes inconvenient
  and the flags are typically reduced to:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable %ftp-flags "cp"
        set-variable %http-flags "cp"

```

  This disables the pop-up feature of the console. Enabling the limited flag
  set allows some post mortem debugging to be performed if anything goes
  wrong. The console buffers are manually selected when these flags are set.


## NOTES


  Note that ftp and http facilities are available on UNIX by default, but
  must be compiled in for Windows versions.

## NAME


  $scroll-bar-scheme - Scroll bar color scheme
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$scroll-bar-scheme__ _schemeNum_; Default is `1`


## DESCRIPTION


  Sets the horizontal window scroll bar color scheme, assigning the
  foreground, background and selection colors which are used to render the
  vertical separator / scroll bars (see [add-color-scheme(2)](add-color-scheme(2))). The separator
  is rendered in reverse video, i.e. the foreground color of the color
  scheme is used as the background color, and vice versa.

  The separator is rendered in the standard colors when the associated
  buffer is not active, and in the current color when the buffer is active.

  The scroll-bar is the window separator constructed by
  [split-window-horizontally(2)](split-window-horizontally(2)) or when the scroll bars are enabled via
  [$scroll-bar(5)]($scroll-bar(5)).

  used to render the windows. The characters have fixed indices defined as
  follows:-

  Index 0
 
  >  The active window mode line separator character, This replaces all
     _Index 1_ characters when the window is current. Default is '__=__'.

  Index 1

     replaced by _Index 0_ characters when the window becomes current.
     Default is '__-__'.

  Index 2
 
  >  UNIX based platforms only. The __root__ or __superuser__ indicator character
     that appears on the mode line. Default is '__#__'.

  Index 7
 
  >  Single column vertical scroll bar upper-shaft character. Default is
     '__|__'.

  Index 8
 
  >  Single column vertical scroll box character. Default is '__#__'.

  Index 9
 
  >  Single column vertical scroll bar lower-shaft character. Default is
     '__|__'.

  Index 10

     '__v__'.

  Index 11
 
  >  Single column vertical scroll bar corner character. Default is '__*__'.

  Index 12-13
 
  >  Double column vertical scroll bar split window horizontally character.
     Default is '__==__'.

  Index 14-15
 
  >  Double column vertical scroll bar up-arrow characters. Default is "__^__".

  Index 16-17
 
  >  Double column vertical scroll bar upper-shaft characters. Default is
     "__||__".

  Index 18-19
 
  >  Double column vertical scroll box characters. Default is "__##__".

  Index 20-21
 
  >  Double column vertical scroll bar lower-shaft characters. Default is
     "__||__".

  Index 22-23
 
  >  Double column vertical scroll bar down-arrow characters. Default is
     "__vv__".

  Index 24-25
 
  >  Double column vertical scroll bar corner characters. Default is "__**__".

  Index 26-32
 
  >  Single column horizontal scroll bar. Default is "__|<-#->*__".

  Index 33-46
 
  >  Double column horizontal scroll bar. Default is "__||<<--##-->>**__".

  Index 47
 
  >  Osd title bar blank character. Default is '__ __'.

  Index 48
 
  >  Osd title bar right corner kill character. Default is '__x__'.

  Index 49
 
  >  Osd dialog bottom right corner resize character. Default is '__*__'.

  Index 50-53
 
  >  Osd button characters. 50 & 52 are used for a normal button, default
     is '__ ___Button___ __'. 51 & 53 are used for the current default button,
     default is '__>___Button___<__'.

  Index 54
 
  >  Displayed tab character (used when [$system(5)]($system(5)) bit 0x80000 is set).
     Default is '__>__'.

  Index 55
 
  >  Displayed new-line character (used when [$system(5)]($system(5)) bit 0x80000 is
     set). Default is '__\__'.

  Index 56
 
  >  Displayed space character (used when [$system(5)]($system(5)) bit 0x80000 is set).
     Default is '__.__'.

  Index 57
 
  >  Displayed truncated text to left character (used when the current line
     is scrolled to the right). Default is '__$__'.

  Index 58
 
  >  Displayed truncated text to right character (used when the current
     line is longer than the window width). Default is '__$__'.

  Index 59
 
  >  Inserted end of wrapped line character in an [ipipe-shell-command(2)](ipipe-shell-command(2))
     buffer. Default is '__\__'.


## EXAMPLE


  The __$window-chars__ is typically platform dependent, it's setting is
  determined by the characters available in character set of the hosting
  platform. MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows use an OEM font might use the
  following value:

       "=-#*%=\C^\xB1 \xB1\C_\CD==\C^\C^\xB1\xB1  \xB1\xB1\C_\C_\C[
       \CZ|\CQ\xB1 \xB1\CP\CD||\CQ\CQ\xB1\xB1  \xB1\xB1\CP\CP\C[
       \CZ x*  >\\.$$\\"


  This utilizes character-set specific characters to render some of the
  window components.


## NOTES


  [$scroll-bar(5)]($scroll-bar(5)) allows the scroll box to be rendered in reverse video
   allowing a space to be used for the scroll box.
  
  Use [insert-symbol(3)](insert-symbol(3)) to determine the displayable characters on the
  host platform.
  
  The use of MicroEmacs's extended character set on Windows and XTerm
  platforms can greatly improve the look and usability of MicroEmacs,
  see the Extend Char Set option in the Platform page of [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3))
  and bit 0x10000 of variable [$system(5)]($system(5)).

## SYNOPSIS


  __$fill-bullet__ "_string_"; Default is "`*)].-`"  
  __$fill-bullet-len__ _length_; Default is `5`  

  0 <= _length_ <= [$buffer-fill-col]($fill-col(5))  


## DESCRIPTION


  __$fill-bullet__ contains the set of characters which are classified as bullet
  markers for [fill-paragraph(2)](fill-paragraph(2)). If these characters are encountered in the
  first __$fill-bullet-len__ characters of the paragraph AND the character is
  followed by a `SPACE` or a `tab` character then the user is given the option
  to indent to the right of the bullet.

  __$fill-bullet-len__ determines the maximum depth into the paragraph (in
  characters) the filling routines should search for a bullet character. The
  default value is 15. Note that the paragraph starts at the first non-white
  space character. e.g. to detect "`xviii) `" as a bullet then the bullet
  length must be set to at least 6 to detect the bullet character "`)`".


## EXAMPLE


  Examples of filled bullet paragraphs are shown as follows, based on the
  default __$fill-bullet__ character set.

      a) This is an  example of a  fill-paragraph.  The  closing
           bracket is classified as a bullet character and filling
           optionally takes place to the right of the bullet.

## DESCRIPTION


  __$fill-ignore__ describes a set of characters used by [fill-paragraph(2)](fill-paragraph(2)) which
  disable paragraph filling when they appear at the start of a paragraph. An
  obvious example is an inserted mail message which is usually quoted with
  "`>`" characters. Any attempt to fill the paragraph causes __fill-paragraph__ to
  skip to the end of it.


## EXAMPLE


  This is an example of an ignored paragraph when encountered by

## NAME


  $scroll-bar - Scroll bar configuration
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$scroll-bar__ "_bitmask_"; Default is platform specific


## DESCRIPTION


  __$scroll-bar__ defines the configuration of the scroll bar and/or the
  horizontal window separator for both main text windows and [osd(2)](osd(2)) dialogs.
  The variable is interpreted as a bit mask and defines which components of
  the scroll bar (or separator) should be rendered in a window. The
  characters used to render the scroll bar or separator are defined by
  [$window-chars(5)]($window-chars(5)). The bit mask is defined as follows:-

  __0x001__ - Vertical Scroll Bar Width
  
  >  Bit 0 controls the width of the vertical scroll bar (or separator). A
     value of 0 corresponds to a single column width, a value of 1 is a
     double column width.

  __0x002__ - Upper end cap
  
  >  Bit 1 set indicates that the scroll bar has an upper end cap. This is
     the up arrow character at the top of a scroll bar.

  __0x004__ - Lower end cap
  
  >  Bit 2 set indicates that the scroll bar has a lower end cap. This is
     the down arrow character at the bottom of a scroll bar.

  __0x008__ - Corner
  
  >  Bit 3 set indicates that separate corner character is used at the
     intersection of the mode line and the separator.

  __0x010__ - Scroll Box Enable
  
  >  Bit 4 determines if the scroll bar has a scrolling box, when the bit
     is set each scroll bar will have a scroll box. When clear, scroll bars
     are rendered according to bits 0-3 & 7 only and the main area of the
     bar is left empty.

  __0x020__ - Reverse Video Box
  
  >  Bit 5 when set enables the scroll box to be rendered in reverse video,
     that is the background and foreground/hilight scroll colors are
     interchanged. This bit is typically set on X-Window platforms allowing
     the scroll box to comprise of `SPACE` characters allowing a solid box to
     be rendered in the foreground color.

  >  Bit 5 is only enacted if scroll boxes are enabled.

  __0x040__ - Horizontal Scroll Bar Width
  
  >  Bit 6 controls the width of the horizontal scroll bar, used only by
     [osd(2)](osd(2)). A value of 0 corresponds to a single column width, a value of
     1 is a double column width.

  __0x080__ - Splitter
  
  >  Bit 7 set indicates that the scroll bar has a splitter. This is the
     split bar character at the top of a scroll bar.

  __0x100__ - Enable window Scroll Bars
  
  >  When Bit 8 is clear, scroll bars are not present on windows. If a
     horizontal split has been performed then the window separator is
     rendered plain. This is useful when performance is important, as
     scroll bars require constant up-date.

  __0x200__ - Horizontal Scroll Bar Width
  
  >  Bit 9 enables scroll bars, when the bit is set each window is assigned
     a scroll bar in the right-hand column(s) of the window with a scroll
     box.

## NAME


  $line-scheme - Set the current line color scheme
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$line-scheme__ _schemeNum_; Default is `-1`


## DESCRIPTION


  __$line-scheme__ sets the color scheme to be used for the current line of the
  current window. The given _schemeNum_ can be any scheme number previously
  defined by the function [add-color-scheme(2)](add-color-scheme(2)).

  A line's $line-scheme setting is removed by setting the variable to -1.

  A $line-scheme setting takes precedence over the buffer's color scheme (
  [$buffer-scheme(5)]($buffer-scheme(5))) and the buffer's hilighting scheme (
  [$buffer-hilight(5)]($buffer-hilight(5))).


## EXAMPLE


  [c-hash-eval(3)](c-hash-eval(3)) greys out lines of text by doing:

```{.emf}
        set-variable $line-scheme %lblack

```

  The lines are rest by doing

```{.emf}
        set-variable $line-scheme -1

```

  The [gdb(3)](gdb(3)) interface hilights the current line of source by doing:

```{.emf}
        set-variable $line-scheme %yellow-lblack

```

## NOTES


  Due to line storage restrictions, only 15 different color schemes can be
  used in a buffer at any one time. When the 16th color scheme is used it
  replaces the first color scheme, all lines using the first color scheme
  will be colored using the new color scheme.

! 5 $search-path
## NAME


  $search-path - MicroEmacs search path


## SYNOPSIS


  __$search-path__ _string_  

  _[Microsoft Windows/MS-DOS]_  
  __$search-path__ _<path1>___;___<path2>___;__....__;___<pathn>_  

  _[UNIX]_  
  __$search-path__ _<path1>___:___<path2>___:__....__:___<pathn>_  


## DESCRIPTION


  __$search-path__ is automatically determined by MicroEmacs when it
  initializes. The variable identifies the directory paths which are
  searched to locate editor specific files. The variable may contain
  multiple search paths each separated by the platform path separator
  (semi-colon ('__;__') on Microsoft Windows or MS-DOS environments and a colon
  ('__:__') on UNIX environments). Where multiple search paths are defined then
  they are searched in a left to right order.

  __$search-path__ is determined at run-time and is fixed once the editor
  starts. The value of the search path is determined from a number of
  different sources in a platform specific manner as follows:-

  - Built in pathnames - On UNIX platforms then preset search paths are
        built into the executable i.e. /opt/jasspa, /usr/local/jasspa etc.
  - The users home directory, taken from the `/etc/passwd` under UNIX and
        from the shell environment under Microsoft Windows.
  - The location of the executable, typically only used under Microsoft
        Windows and MS-DOS environments where the concept of standard
        installation locations is vague.
  - The environment variable [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)) which identifies the
        preferred user directory location, overriding any home directory
        location specified by the system.
  - The environment variable [$MEINSTALLPATH(5)]($MEINSTALLPATH(5)) which identifies the
        installation directory of the standard macros overriding any built
        in search path(s).
  - The environment variable [$MEPATH(5)]($MEPATH(5)) which absolutely overrides any
        search paths with a user defined path where [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)) is not
        defined.
  - The command line option __-u__ _user-name_ to [me(1)](me(1)) which overrides the
        user name found by the system.
  - The environment variable [$MENAME(5)]($MENAME(5)) which overrides the user name
        found by the system.

  The search paths are generally ordered from highest priority to lowest
  priority and typically arranged in the order:-

  >  __$search-path=___<user>_:_<company>_:_<me>_

  where _<user>_ represents the users path(s); _<company>_ is the company file
  path(s) (e.g. company wide template files) and _<me>_ path(s) which contain
  the standard MicroEmacs 2009 files.

  This would correspond to a typical directory installation, of user __foo__ on
  UNIX such as:

 `/usr/foo/.jassa          `- User files.  
 `/usr/local/jasspa/company` - Company wide files  
 `/usr/local/jasspa/macros `- MicroEmacs installation directory  


## USAGE


  The current working directory is always checked first for the location of
  any file.

  __$search-path__ is used to locate all macro files, and other files located
  with operators such as [&find(4)](&find(4)).

  Users should not modify this variable directly, the external
  aforementioned environment variables should be used to affect any desired
  changes.


## NOTES


  The search path operation was revised in the MicroEmacs 2004 release and
  operates differently from earlier releases.

! 5 $file-ignore
## NAME


  $file-ignore - File extensions to ignore
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$file-ignore__ "_string_"; Default is ""


## DESCRIPTION


  __$file-ignore__ specifies a space separated list of file endings which the
  file completion is to ignore. This is used by any function which prompts
  the user for a file name, such as [find-file(2)](find-file(2)). A file ending in this case
  is NOT the extension but the last _n_ characters where _n_ is the number of
  characters in the specified ignore file.


## EXAMPLE


  To ignore all files which have the extension "`o`", using:

```{.emf}
        set-variable $file-ignore "o"

```

  would not only ignore "`foo.o`", but also "`foo.oo`", "`foo.po`" and "`foo`" as
  well as any file that ends in an "`o`". What is really required is

```{.emf}
        set-variable $file-ignore ".o"

```

  It is useful to ignore the "`./`" and "`../`" directories so that a directory
  containing one file will auto-complete to that one file. This is achieved
  by using:

```{.emf}
        set-variable $file-ignore "./"

```
 
  To ignore MicroEmacs 2009 backup files ("`~`"), C object files ("`.o`"), "`./`"
  and "`../`" directories try using:

```{.emf}
        set-variable $file-ignore "~ .o ./"

```

## NOTES


  The file completion only completes further than the first non-unique point
  in the current list of possibles if and only if it can ignore all but one
  file, so if the current directory contains:

       ./ ../ foo foo.c foo.c~ foo.o


  using the above ignore list, completing with "" has no effect as "`foo`" and
  "`foo.c`" cannot be ignored; completing with "`foo.`" will however complete to
  "`foo.c`".

! 5 $show-region
## NAME


  $show-region - Enable the hilighting of regions
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$show-region__ _flag_; Default is `1`


## DESCRIPTION


  __$show-region__ enables or disables the current region hilighting, normally
  associated with mouse interaction in a buffer. Region hilighting occurs
  between the _mark_ (see [set-mark(2)](set-mark(2))) and _point_ (current cursor) positions
  within the current buffer. An argument _n_ of 0 disables region hilighting,
  an argument of 1 enables region hilighting between the two positions. If
  it is set to 3 then region hilighting will be enabled and a defined region
  (created using [copy-region(2)](copy-region(2))or [yank(2)](yank(2))) will continue to be hilighted
  until the region is changed.

  A defined region can be redisplayed (if still valid) using the command
  [show-region(2)](show-region(2)). The color of the region hilighting is defined by
  [add-color-scheme(2)](add-color-scheme(2)) and is determined by [$buffer-scheme(5)]($buffer-scheme(5)),
  [$global-scheme(5)]($global-scheme(5)) or [$buffer-hilight(5)]($buffer-hilight(5)).

! 5 $time
## NAME


  $time - The current system time
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$time__ "_string_"


## DESCRIPTION


  __$time__ is a constantly changing variable which is set to the current system
  time. The format of __$time__ is "`YYYYCCCMMDDWhhmmssSSS`", where:-

  __YYYY__
  
  >  The current year (full 4 digits so should be millennium bug free).

  __CCC__
  
  >  Day of the year (0-366).

  __MM__
  
  >  The month of the year (1-12).

  __DD__
  
  >  The day of the month (1-31).

  __W__
  
  >  The day of the week (0-6 Sunday=0).

  __hh__
  
  >  The hour (0-23).

  __mm__
  
  >  The minute (0-59).

  __ss__
  
  >  The second (0-59).

  __SSS__
  
  >  The millisecond (0-999).

  __$time__ can be set to an integer value which is a time offset in seconds,
  for example if the following was executed;-

```{.emf}
        set-variable $time "3600"
        ml-write &cat "$time is " $time
        set-variable $time "0"

```

  The written time would one hour ahead of the system time.


## EXAMPLE


  The following macro times the time taken to execute a user command:-

```{.emf}
        define-macro time
            !force set-variable #l2 @1
            !if &not $status
                set-variable #l2 @ml00 "Time command"
            !endif
            set-variable #l0 $time
            !force execute-line #l2
            set-variable #l1 $time
            set-variable #l2 &add &mid #l0 16 2 &mul 60 &add &mid #l0 14 2 &mul 60 &mid #l0 12 2
            set-variable #l3 &add &mid #l1 16 2 &mul 60 &add &mid #l1 14 2 &mul 60 &mid #l1 12 2
            !if &les &set #l4 &sub &rig #l1 18 &rig #l0 18 0
                set-variable #l2 &add #l2 1
                set-variable #l4 &add 1000 #l4
            !endif
            ml-write &spr "Command took %d sec %d msec" &sub #l3 #l2 #l4
        !emacro

```

  [time(3)](time(3)) is a macro defined in misc.emf.

  [organizer(3)](organizer(3)) uses $time to work out the current month.

! 5 $buffer-names
## NAME


  $buffer-names - Filtered buffer name list


## SYNOPSIS


  __$buffer-names__ _BufferName_


## DESCRIPTION


  __$buffer-names__ must first be set to the required filter string, if the
  variable is evaluated before it is initialized the value will be set to
  "_ABORT_" and the command will fail. The filter takes the form of a [regex](RegularExpressions(2)).

  Once initialized, evaluating __$buffer-names__ returns the name of the next
  buffer which matches the filter until no more buffers are found, in which
  case an empty string is returned.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example prints out the name of all buffers to the massage
  line one at a time. Note that [&set(4)](&set(4)) is used on the [!while(4)](!while(4)) statement
  to avoid evaluating __$buffer-names__ twice per loop.

```{.emf}
        set-variable $buffer-names ".*"
        !while &not &seq &set #l0 $buffer-names ""
            100 ml-write &cat "buffer: " #l0
        !done

```

  The following example is the same except it lists only the buffers which
  are not directory listings

```{.emf}
        set-variable $buffer-names ".*[^/]"
        !while &not &seq &set #l0 $buffer-names ""
            100 ml-write &cat "buffer: " #l0
        !done

```

## NOTES


  The list of buffers is evaluated when the variable is initialized, buffers
  created after the initialization will not be included in the list.

  Deleting buffers which are in the list, before they are evaluated, will
  have undefined effects.

## DESCRIPTION


  __$command-names__ must first be initialized to the required filter string, if
  the variable is evaluated before it is initialized the value will be set
  to "_ABORT_" and the command will fail. The filter takes the form of a
  [regex](RegularExpressions(2)).

  Once initialized, evaluating __$command-names__ returns the name of the next
  command which matches the filter until no more commands are found, in
  which case an empty string is returned.


## EXAMPLE

```

  The following example is an alternative implementation of
  [command-apropos(2)](command-apropos(2)).

```{.emf}
        define-macro alt-commad-apropos
            set-variable #l1 @ml "Apropos string"

## NOTES


  __$command-names__ does not differentiate between built in commands and

## SYNOPSIS


  __$file-names__ _FileName_


## DESCRIPTION


  __$file-names__ must first be initialized to the required filter string, if
  the variable is evaluated before it is initialized the value will be set
  to "_ABORT_" and the command will fail.

  The filter takes the form of a [regex](RegularExpressions(2)). The filter string should also
  contain the path to the required directory, the path many not contain
  wild-cards. If no path is specified the the path of the current buffers
  file name is taken, if the current buffer has no file name then the
  current working directory is used.

  On initialization, [$result(5)]($result(5)) is set to the absolute path of the directory
  being evaluated.

  Once initialized, evaluating __$file-names__ returns the name of the next
  buffer which matches the filter until no more buffers are found, in which
  case an empty string is returned.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example creates a list of all files in the current directory
  to a fixed buffer `"*files*"`. 
  Note that [&set(4)](&set(4)) is used on the [!while(4)](!while(4))
  statement to avoid evaluating __$file-names__ twice per loop.

```{.emf}
        set-variable $file-names ".*"
        !force 0 delete-buffer "*files*"
        1 popup-window "*files*"
        insert-string &spr "Directory listing of %s\n\n" $result
        !while &not &seq &set #l0 $file-names ""
            insert-string &spr "    %s\n" #l0
        !done
        beginning-of-buffer
        -1 buffer-mode "edit"
        1 buffer-mode "view"

```

## NOTES


  Unlike MS-DOS and Windows systems, to match every file a filter of just
  "`*`" is required. A filter of "`*.*`" only matches file names with a '`.`' in
  them.

  The list of files is evaluated when the variable is initialized, files
  created after the initialization will not be included in the list.

  Once initialized, evaluating __$mode-names__ returns the name of the next mode
  which matches the filter until no more modes are found, in which case an
  empty string is returned.

! 5 $find-words
## NAME


  $find-words - Filtered word list


## SYNOPSIS


  __$find-words__ _word_


## DESCRIPTION


  __$find-words__ must first be initialized to the required filter string, if
  the variable is evaluated before it is initialized the value will be set
  to "_ABORT_" and the command will fail.

  The filter string can contain wild-card characters compatible with most
  file systems, namely:-

  __?__
  
  >  Match any character.

  __[abc]__
  
  >  Match character only if it is _a_, _b_ or _c_.

  __[a-d]__
  
  >  Match character only if it is _a_, _b_, _c_ or _d_.

  __[^abc]__
  
  >  Match character only if it is not _a_, _b_ or _c_.

  __*__
  
  >  Match any number of characters.

  Note that these are not the same characters used by [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) mode.

  Once initialized, evaluating __$find-words__ returns the next word found in
  the main spell dictionaries which matches the filter until no more words
  are found, in which case an empty string is returned.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example finds all the words with "_foo_" in it (e.g.
  "_footnote_"), printing them to the massage line one at a time. Note that
  [&set(4)](&set(4)) is used on the [!while(4)](!while(4)) statement to avoid evaluating $find-words
  twice per loop.

```{.emf}
        set-variable $find-words "*foo*"
        !while &not &seq &set #l0 $find-words ""
            100 ml-write &cat "Word: " #l0
        !done

```

## NOTES


  The order of the words is undefined.

  Due to the way words are derived, it is possible to have two or more
  copies of a word in the dictionary. If this is a matching word __$find-words__
  will return the word two or more times.

## DESCRIPTION


  __$variable-names__ must first be initialized to the required filter string,
  if the variable is evaluated before it is initialized the value will be
  set to "_ABORT_" and the command will fail.

  The filter string can contain wild-card characters compatible with most
  file systems, namely:-

  __?__
  
  >  Match any character.

  __[abc]__
  
  >  Match character only if it is _a_, _b_ or _c_.

  __[^abc]__
  
  >  Match character only if it is not _a_, _b_ or _c_.

  __*__
  
  >  Match any number of characters.

  Note that these are not the same characters used by [exact(2m)](exact(2m)) mode.

  Once initialized, evaluating __$variable-names__ returns the name of the next
  variable which matches the filter until no more variables are found, in
  which case an empty string is returned.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example prints out the name of all variables to the massage
  line one at a time. Note that [&set(4)](&set(4)) is used on the [!while(4)](!while(4)) statement
  to avoid evaluating __$variable-names__ twice per loop.

            100 ml-write &cat "variable: " #l0
        !done

```

## NOTES


  The list of variables is evaluated when the variable is initialized,
  variables defined after the initialization will not be included in the
  list. The list can contain the current buffer's buffer variables (See
  [Variables(4)](Variables(4)) for more information on the different types of variables).

  Using [unset-variable(2)](unset-variable(2)) to delete a variable which are in the list, before
  it has be evaluated, will have undefined effects.

## DESCRIPTION


  __$temp-names__ is automatically set to a nonexistent file name in the systems
  temporary file directory. On UNIX systems the temporary directory is fixed
  to "`/tmp/`", on other systems the temporary directory is set by the __$TEMP__
  environment variable.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example uuencodes a given file into a temporary file and
  then inserts this file into the current buffer.

```{.emf}
        set-variable #l0 @ml04 "Uuencode and insert file"
        set-variable #l1 $temp-name

        insert-file #l1
        !force shell-command &cat "rm " #l1

```

## NOTES


  This variable can not be set, any attempt to set it will result in an
  error.

  The returned file name is not guaranteed to be unique between calls, only
  that the file does not currently exist.

## NAME


|$buffer-fmod
  $buffer-fmod - Buffer file modes (or attributes)
|$global-fmod
  $global-fmod - Global file modes (or attributes)
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$buffer-fmod__ _FileMode_  
  __$global-fmod__ _FileMode_  


## DESCRIPTION


  __$buffer-fmod__ is bit based variable setting the buffers file system modes
  or attributes. If the buffer was loaded from an existing file then the
  value of __$buffer-fmod__ is taken directly from the file. But if the buffer
  was created then the buffer inherits the default file modes, __$global-fmod__,
  which is determined from the users umask on UNIX or a default on others.

  The definition of the file mode bits are platform specific and are
  considered independently, as follows:


## UNIX 


  The file modes of Unix are the standard read, write and execute
  permissions for user, group and global. See __chmod(1)__ for a full
  description of their use and effect.

  The variable is displayed in octal.


## Microsoft Windows and DOS 


  On Microsoft platforms each file attribute (see __attrib(1)__) is assigned a
  bit, on windows 95 and NT the new file attributes such as compressed are
  also represented. The bits are assigned as follows

      Bit     Attrib Flag     Attribute
      0x001       R           Read Only
      0x002       H           Hidden
      0x004       S           System
      0x010                   Directory
      0x020       A           Archive
      0x080                   Normal
      0x100                   Temporary
      0x800                   Compressed


## EXAMPLE


  The following example changes the $buffer-fmod so that the file will be
  executable (UNIX only), useful when writing a shell script.

```{.emf}
        set-variable $buffer-fmod 0775

## NAME


|$delay-time
  $delay-time - Mouse time event delay time
|$repeat-time
  $repeat-time - Mouse time event repeat time
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$delay-time__ _milliseconds_; Default is `500`
  __$repeat-time__ _milliseconds_; Default is `25`

  10 <= _milliseconds_ <= t


## DESCRIPTION


  __$delay-time__ sets the time waited between the user picking a mouse button
  and the generation of a `mouse-time-?` key event.

  When user presses the left button (say) a `mouse-pick-1` key event is
  generated, If this key is bound then the command it is bound to is
  executed. If the user then holds down the button for __$delay-time__ or more
  milliseconds then MicroEmacs checks the binding of the special
  `mouse-time-1` key, if this pseudo key is bound then the command it is bound
  to will be executed.

  If the user continues to hold down the button for a further __$repeat-time__
  milliseconds another __mouse-time-1__ key event will be generated. A
  __mouse-time-1__ key event will be generated after every __$repeat-time__
  milliseconds until the user releases the button, at which point a
  `mouse-drop-1` key event is generated.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example implements the vertical scroll-bar up and down
  scrolling arrows for a buffer window:-

```{.emf}
        define-macro mouse-pick-command
            set-cursor-to-mouse
            !if &equ &band $mouse-pos 15 5
                ml-write "Mouse on up-arrow"
                1 scroll-up
                1 global-bind-key scroll-up "mouse-time-1"
            !elif &equ &band $mouse-pos 15 9
                ml-write "Mouse on down-arrow"
                1 scroll-down
                1 global-bind-key scroll-down "mouse-time-1"
            !endif
        !emacro

        define-macro mouse-drop-command
            !force global-unbind-key "mouse-time-1"
        !emacro

        global-bind-key mouse-pick-command "mouse-pick-1"
        global-bind-key mouse-drop-command "mouse-drop-1"

```

! 5 $idle-time
## NAME


  $idle-time - System idle event delay time
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$idle-time__ _milliseconds_; Default is `1000`

  10 <= _milliseconds_ <= t


## DESCRIPTION


  __$idle-time__ sets the time waited between the last user event and the
  generation of a `idle-pick` key event. When user input stops for __$idle-time__
  milliseconds MicroEmacs checks the binding of the special `idle-pick` key,
  if this pseudo key is bound then the command it is bound to will be
  executed. MicroEmacs will then cycle, generating a `idle-pick` every
  __$idle-time__ milliseconds until user activity starts. At this point a
  `idle-drop` key event is generated, if this pseudo key is bound then the
  command it is bound to will be executed.

  This system is useful for things which can be done in the background.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example is taken from `ssaver.emf` and implements a simple
  screen saver:-

```{.emf}
        set-variable %screen-saver 0
        define-macro screen-saver
            !if &not &pinc %screen-saver 1
                !if &seq @cck "idle-pick"
                    ; default is to switch on in 5 minutes time
                    &cond @? @# 300000 create-callback screen-saver
                !else
                    !if &seq @cck "callback"
                        @# create-callback screen-saver
                    !elif @?
                        ; user has suppled argument, install or remove
                        !if &gre @# 0
                            &mul @# 60000 global-bind-key screen-saver "idle-pick"
                        !else
                            !force global-unbind-key "idle-pick"
                        !endif
                        set-variable %screen-saver &sub %screen-saver 1
                        !return
                    !endif
                    set-variable @# $frame-depth
                    !while &dec @# 1
                        2 screen-poke @# 0 $global-scheme &spr "%n" $frame-width " "
                    !done
                    0 screen-poke 0 0 $global-scheme &spr "%n" $frame-width " "
                    -1 show-cursor
                    ; must set this to stop recursion when waiting for a key!
                    set-variable %screen-saver 0
                    set-variable @# @cg
                    set-variable %screen-saver 1
                    1 show-cursor
                    screen-update
                    0 ml-write
                !endif
            !endif
            set-variable %screen-saver &sub %screen-saver 1
        !emacro

```

## NOTES


  Care must be taken to ensure that a recursive loop is not created,
  consider the following example:-

```{.emf}
        define-macro bored
            !if &iseq @mc1 "Are you bored (y/n)? " "nNyY" "y"
                ml-write "Play a silly game!"
            !endif
        !emacro
        global-bind-key bored idle-pick

```

  If this was executed MicroEmacs would very quickly crash! As soon as a
  second past __bored__ would execute, which will prompt the user and wait for
  input. If a second passes without input __bored__ will be executed again and
  again and again until stack memory runs out! To avoid this `idle-pick`
  should be unbound before waiting for user input, i.e.:-

```{.emf}
        define-macro bored
            global-unbind-key idle-pick
            !if &iseq @mc1 "Are you bored (y/n)? " "nNyY" "y"
                ml-write "Play a silly game!"
            !endif
            global-bind-key bored idle-pick
        !emacro
        global-bind-key bored idle-pick

```

! 5 $mouse
## NAME


  $mouse - Mouse configuration variable
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$mouse__ _bitmask_; Default is system dependent


## DESCRIPTION


  The __$mouse__ is used to define and configure the MicroEmacs mouse support,
  it is a bit based flag where:-

  __0x00f__
  
  >  Defines the number of button the mouse has, only values 1, 2 & 3 are
     useful. By default MicroEmacs uses the system information to determine
     the number of buttons on the mouse, this is not fool proof so the user
     can set these bits to the appropriate number if the initial value is
     incorrect.

  __0x010__
  
  >  If set the mouse is enabled, if clear the mouse will not function. On
     systems which do not support mice (such as UNIX Termcap) this bit will
     be clear and can not be altered.

  __0x020__
  
  >  If set the buttons are reversed, i.e. the left button becomes the
     right and vice versa. By default this bit is clear.

  __0xf0000__
  
  >  Defines the current mouse icon to used, valid values are as follows:

            0x00000 - Set mouse to default icon.
            0x10000 - Set mouse to arrow icon.
            0x20000 - Set mouse to text I-beam icon.
            0x30000 - Set mouse to crosshair icon.
            0x40000 - Set mouse to the grab icon.
            0x50000 - Set mouse to the wait icon.
            0x60000 - Set mouse to the stop icon.

  >  This feature is not supported on some systems and on others some icons
     are not obvious due to platform limitations.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example checks that the mouse is currently available, if
  not, it aborts.

```{.emf}
        !if &not &band $mouse 0x10
            ml-write "[Mouse support is not currently available]"
            !abort
        !endif

```

## NOTES


  The mouse can be easily configured using [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)).

! 5 $kept-versions
## NAME


  $kept-versions - Number of backups to be kept
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$kept-versions__ _integer_; Default is 0

  0 <= _integer_ <= n


## DESCRIPTION


  __$kept-versions__ allows the user to specify the number of backup versions
  that are required for each file. For file "`XXXX`", each backup version is
  renamed to "`XXXX.~?~`", where `?` is the backup number. If __$kept-versions__ is
  set to 0 this feature is disabled and the default single backup file is
  created.

  The most recent backup will always be `.~0~` and the last version will be
  `.~n~` where `n` is __$kept-versions__ - 1. when the file is next saved the `.~0~`
  backup file is moved to `.~1~`, `.~1~` to `.~2~` etc, backup `.~n~` is removed.
  Evidently if __$kept-versions__ it set to a large number this can effect
  performance.


## RESTRICTIONS


  __$kept-versions__ may only be used when DOS file name restrictions are not
  enabled. This means that some systems (such as DOS) cannot use this
  functionality, see [$system(5)]($system(5)) for more information. Backup files are only
  created when buffer mode [backup(2m)](backup(2m)) is enabled.


## NOTES


  This feature is not supported when writing ftp files, a single backup file
  is created when backup files are enabled.

!! me-id: m5var075
! 5 $buffer-indent
## NAME


  $buffer-indent - Current buffer indentation scheme.
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$buffer-indent__ _indentNum_; Default is `0`  

  0 <= _indentNum_ <= 255


## DESCRIPTION


  __$buffer-indent__ sets the current buffers indentation scheme. _indentNum_ is
  the identity of the indentation scheme, as defined by [indent(2)](indent(2)), which is
  typically the same value as the buffers hilighting scheme number (see
  [$buffer-hilight(5)]($buffer-hilight(5))).

  The default setting is 0 which specifies no indentation scheme is present.
  When non-zero, the value identifies the indentation scheme.

  A buffer assigned an indentation method, MicroEmacs performs automatic
  line re-styling, by moving the left indentation, according to the defined
  indentation method. The `tab` key is typically disabled. This behavior can
  be altered using bit `0x1000` of the [$system(5)]($system(5)) variable, which can be
  changed using [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)).

  The use of tab characters to create the required indentation is determined
  by the setting of the buffers [tab(2m)](tab(2m)) mode. If the mode is disabled tab
  characters are used wherever possible, otherwise spaces are always used.


## NOTES


  The commands [restyle-region(3)](restyle-region(3)) and [restyle-buffer(3)](restyle-buffer(3)) use the indentation
  method when defined.

  The buffer indentation scheme is typically assigned in the _fhook_ macro,
  see [Language Templates](languageTemplates(2)).


## EXAMPLE


  The following example sets up an indentation scheme for a buffer within
  the _fhook_ macro.

```{.emf}
        !if &sequal .hilight.foo "ERROR"
            set-variable .hilight.foo &pinc .hilight.next 1
        !endif

        ....

        ; Define the indentation scheme
        0 indent  .hilight.foo 2 10
        indent .hilight.foo n "then" 4
        indent .hilight.foo s "else" -4
        indent .hilight.foo o "endif" -4

        ....

        ; File hook - called when new file is loaded.
        define-macro fhook-foo
            ; if arg is 0 this is a new file so add template
            !if &not @#
                etfinsrt "foo"
            !endif
            ; Assign the hilighting
            set-variable $buffer-hilight .hilight.foo
            ; Assign the buffer indentation
            set-variable $buffer-indent .hilight.foo
            ; Set the abbreviation file
            buffer-abbrev-file "foo"
            ; Temporary comment to make sure that it works.
            ml-write "Loaded a foo file"
        !emacro

```

  This provides an indentation of the form:-

      if condition
      then
             XXXX
      else
            if condition
            then
                XXXX
            endif
      endif

## NAME


|$MENAME
  $MENAME - MicroEmacs user name
|$LOGNAME
  $LOGNAME - System user name (UNIX)
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$MENAME__ _string_  

  __$LOGNAME__ _string_


## DESCRIPTION


  __$MENAME__ is an environment variable which may be used to initialize the
  MicroEmacs 2009 environment for a given user. At start-up, if __$MENAME__ is
  defined then the user's configuration and history file "`name`_.erf_" is
  located and read, where `name` is the variable value. The environment
  variable is used to initialise the [$user-name(5)]($user-name(5)) variable.

  Where the user name has been specified on the command line using the __-u__
  option to [me(1)](me(1)) then the environment variable is ignored and __-u__ option
  takes precedence.

  The user configuration and session file has many uses, see [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3))
  and [read-session(3)](read-session(3)) for more information.


## Microsoft Windows Environments 


  Within Microsoft Windows environments, if _login_ is enabled then the users
  login name is automatically used as the first choice login name. No
  environment variables need to be set. If login is not enabled then one of
  the aforementioned methods should be used.


## Microsoft Windoes 


  In Microsoft Windows environments, __$LOGNAME__ is sometimes defined.


## NOTES


  The three variables must be defined before start-up for them to have any
  effect.

## DESCRIPTION


  __$recent-keys__ is a system variable that displays the last 100 keys entered
  into the system in reverse order. This variable is typically used to solve
  keyboard mapping problems when keys are not bound etc. allowing a visual
  inspection of the input into the editor.

  The variable may only be set to the empty string (_""_), emptying the list.

## DESCRIPTION


  If the __%http-proxy-addr__ variable is set all HTTP file loading requests,
  using commands like [find-file(2)](find-file(2)), are sent via the given proxy server.
  __%http-proxy-port__ should be set to the proxy servers port number,
  defaulting to `80` if not set. These variables are typically set in your
  `<user>.emf` setup file, e.g.:

```{.emf}
        set-variable %http-proxy-addr "proxy.foobar.com"
        set-variable %http-proxy-port "8080"

! 5 $trunc-scheme
## NAME


  $trunc-scheme - Truncation color scheme.
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$trunc-scheme__ _schemeNum_; Default is `0`


## DESCRIPTION


  __$trunc-scheme__ sets the color scheme used when drawing a line truncation
  indicator. The left truncation character (usually a '`$`' char) drawn at the
  start of the line indicates that the line has been scrolled to the right
  and therefore the start of the line has been truncated. A right truncation
  char (also usually a '`$`') drawn at the end of the line indicates the
  remainder of the line is too long to fit onto the width of the window so
  the end has been truncated and the indicator drawn.

  The _schemeNum_ selected must be a color scheme defined with
  [add-color-scheme(2)](add-color-scheme(2)), which identifies the foreground and background color
  schemes. A hilight scheme can define its own truncation color scheme, see
  [hilight(2)](hilight(2)) for more information.


## NOTES


  The truncation characters used are set by the [$window-chars(5)]($window-chars(5)) variable.

|$window-xcl-scroll
  $window-xcl-sroll - Current window current line X scroll

$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$window-x-sroll__ _integer_  
  __$window-xcl-sroll__ _integer_  

  0 <= _integer_ <= 65535  

  __$window-y-sroll__ _integer_  

  0 <= _integer_ <= n  


## DESCRIPTION


  __$window-x-sroll__ defines the horizontal scroll position in the current
  window for all lines except the current line, __$window-xcl-sroll__ defines
  the scroll position for the current line. The variables set how many
  characters are scrolled off the left hand edge of the current window, the
  variables are indirectly set by commands such as [scroll-left(2)](scroll-left(2)),
  [forward-char(2)](forward-char(2)) etc.

  __$window-y-sroll__ defines the vertical scroll position in the current
  window. It sets the number of lines are scroll up off the top of the
  current window, it is indirectly set by commands such as [scroll-up(2)](scroll-up(2)),
  [forward-line(2)](forward-line(2)) etc.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example first stores the current window's buffer position
  and the window layout. The middle '`...`' section could be replaced with
  macro code performing any number of operations before the last section
  which restores the initial position:

```{.emf}
            set-variable #l0 $window-line
            set-variable #l1 $window-col
            set-variable #l2 $window-xcl-scroll
            set-variable #l3 $window-x-scroll
            set-variable #l4 $window-y-scroll
                .
                .
                .
            set-variable $window-line #l0
            set-variable $window-col #l1
            set-variable $window-xcl-scroll #l2
            set-variable $window-x-scroll #l3
            set-variable $window-y-scroll #l4

```

## NOTES


  If these variables are set by the user or a macro the value is validated
  against the [$scroll(5)]($scroll(5)) method and the current cursor position which may
  lead to the variable being reset if found to be invalid. For example, if
  the current line is 10 when the __$window-y-scroll__ is set to 20 the variable
  will be reset to 0 as a value of 20 will mean the current line is not
  displayed in the current window.

! 5 $MEBACKUPSUB
## NAME


  $buffer-backup - Buffer backup file name
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$buffer-backup__ _FileName_


## DESCRIPTION


  __$buffer-backup__ is automatically set to the file name the current buffer's
  file would be backed up to if required. If the current buffer has no file
  name the variable will be set to "".

  The value depends on whether DOS compliant file names are being used (see
  [$system(5)]($system(5))), whether multiple backups are being kept (see
  [$kept-versions(5)]($kept-versions(5))) and the setting of the environment variables
  __$MEBACKUPPATH__ and __$MEBACKUPSUB__. The variable does not take into
  consideration the current setting of the buffer's [backup(2m)](backup(2m)) mode which
  determine whether a backup will be made.

  The environment variable __$MEBACKUPPATH__ can be used to change the location
  of the backup files, it can also be used to prepend the backup filename
  with a string. __$MEBACKUPPATH__ can specify an absolute path (e.g.
  "`c:/temp/mebackup/`") or a relative path (e.g. "`mebackup/`" which will move
  all backup files into a sub-directory automatically in the files
  directory).

  The trailing '`/`' is important as the file name is simple appended, i.e. is
  creating a backup for "c:/foo/bar.txt" and __$MEBACKUPPATH__ is set the
  "backup" the backup file name will be "c:/foo/backupbar.txt".

  The environment variable __$MEBACKUPSUB__ can be used to substitute strings
  within the backup filename for another. The format of the value is a list
  of __sed(1)__ string substitutions, i.e.

      $MEBACKUPSUB="s/from1/to1/ s/from2/to2/ s/fr..."


  The 3 divide characters do not have to be '/'s, they can be any character
  as long as they are the same, e.g. "sXfrom1Xto1X". When define MicroEmacs
  performs a simple search for string "`from1`" (i.e. no regex support) and
  replaces any match with the string "to1" etc.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example compares the differences between the current version
  and the bucked up version using the [diff(3)](diff(3)) macro. The __diff-changes__ macro
  is defined in `tools.emf`.

```{.emf}
        define-macro diff-changes
            !if &seq $buffer-fname ""
                ml-write "[Current buffer has no file name]"
                !abort
            !endif
            !if &bmod "edit"
                !if &iseq @mc1 "Save buffer first [y/n]? " "nNyY" "y"
                    save-buffer
                !endif
            !endif
            ; get the real file name - this only has effect on unix, copes with symbolic links
            set-variable #l0 &stat "a" $buffer-fname
            ; get the backup name
            set-variable #l1 $buffer-backup
            diff #l1 #l0
        !emacro

```

## NOTES


  The variable __$buffer-backup__ can not be set, any attempt to set it will
  result in an error.

  On Windows and DOS platforms if the __$MEBACKUPPATH__ and __$MEBACKUPSUB__
  variables are used all remaining '`:`' characters are changed to '`/`'s as
  these are illegal in the middle of a filename.

## NAME


  $version - MicroEmacs version date-code
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$version__ "_YYYYMMDD_"    - Full Release  
  __$version__ "_YYYYMMDDbN_"  - Beta Release  
  


## DESCRIPTION


  __$version__ is a system variable which is defined as the MicroEmacs build
  date code. This value is fixed at compile time and cannot be changed. The
  variable may be used in macros to identify incompatibility issues.


## EXAMPLE


  Given a macro that only operates with a MicroEmacs executable built on or
  after 1st August 2001 then this macro should check that `$version` is not
  less than `20010801`. The check may be performed as follows:

```{.emf}
        !if &les $version "20010801"
            ml-write "[Error: MicroEmacs executable is incompatible]"
            !abort
        !endif

```

## NOTES


  This variable was introduced in 2001-08-01, evaluating this variable on an
  earlier version of MicroEmacs would return the string "`ERROR`" unless an
  environment variable $version has been defined. "`ERROR`" evaluates to `0`
  hence the test still operates correctly.

  In 2024 with version "20091224" the variable was extended to introduce 
  beta-releases with the string  "b1" or "b2" at the end, for instance
  "20091224b1". 
  
  Please note that since 2021 the four numbers at the beginning does not give
  the release year, but the version year. There is this MicroEmacs 2009 version
  and an other, at this time not yet released, MicroEmacs 2024 version.
  
  This variable is used in the macro file `me.emf` to check for any macro -
  executable incompatibility issues.

! 5 $window-flags
## NAME


  $window-flags - Current window setup flags
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$window-flags__ _bitmask_; Default is `0`


## DESCRIPTION


  The __$window-flags__ variable is used to set or get various behavioural
  characteristic settings of the current window, it is a bit based flag
  where:

  __0x001__
  
  >  If set the width of the window is locked, calls to
     [resize-all-windows(2)](resize-all-windows(2)) will maintained the width of this window
     whenever possible.

  __0x002__
  
  >  If set the depth of the window is locked, calls to
     [resize-all-windows(2)](resize-all-windows(2)) will maintained the depth of this window
     whenever possible.

  __0x004__
  
  >  If set the buffer being displayed by the window is locked, the user
     can still manually change the buffer being displayed (by using
     commands like [find-buffer(2)](find-buffer(2))) but commands that pop-up buffers (such
     as [help(2)](help(2)) or [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2))) will not use this window.

  __0x008__
  
  >  When set the command [compare-windows(2)](compare-windows(2)) will ignore this window.

  __0x010__
  
  >  When set the commands like [previous-window(2)](previous-window(2)) and [next-window(2)](next-window(2)) will
     skip this window unless the numeric argument given to the command is
     used to override the flag setting.

  __0x020__
  
  >  When set the command [delete-other-windows(2)](delete-other-windows(2)) will not delete this
     window unless the numeric argument given to the command is used to
     override the flag setting.

  __0x040__
  
  >  When set the command [delete-window(2)](delete-window(2)) will not delete this window
     unless the numeric argument given to the command is used to override
     the flag setting.

  __0x080__
  
  >  When set the window cannot be split using either the
     [split-window-horizontally(2)](split-window-horizontally(2)) or [split-window-vertically(2)](split-window-vertically(2)) commands.

  __0x100__
  
  >  If not set the window cannot be deleted if it is the only window
     without this bit set. This more esoteric feature is utilized by the
     toolbar, all toolbar windows have this bit set which means that the
     main user window cannot be delete.


## NOTES


  The $window-flags setting is not preserved during a window splitting
  operation (i.e. using a command like [split-window-vertically(2)](split-window-vertically(2))) as the
  persistence of these settings can lead to unexpected behaviour.

  The toolbar uses bit 0x1000 to indicate that the window is displaying a
  toolbar tool, this bit should not be used by users and its value should be
  maintained.

! 5 $line-flags
## NAME


  $line-flags - Current buffer line flags
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$line-flags__ _bitmask_; No default


## DESCRIPTION


  The __$line-flags__ variable is used to retrieve or define the behavioral
  settings of the current line in the buffer. This variable is a bit flag,
  the length of the bit flag is variable. In smaller builds of MicroEmacs
  where features have been disabled then the field is only 8 bits wide, in a
  normal build then the full 16 bits are present.

  __0x0001__
  
  >  The line has changed as a result of an edit and has not been
     re-displayed. The flag is cleared when the change has been displayed.
     This bit is read only.

  __0x0002__
  
  >  The line contains an alpha mark defined by [set-alpha-mark(2)](set-alpha-mark(2)). This bit
     is read only.

  __0x0004__
  
  >  The line contains a narrow region, set by [narrow-buffer(2)](narrow-buffer(2)). This bit
     is read only.

  __0x0008__
  
  >  The line contains some other type of anchor. This bit is read only.

  __0x0010__
  
  >  The line should be saved without a new-line or nil termination
     character.

  __0x0020__
  
  >  The line is a mark-up line used for annotation and should not be saved
     on a write operation. This bit permits lines in a buffer to be
     inserted for display or annotation purposes which are automatically
     discarded when the buffer is written to file. Mark-up lines are
     sometimes used by the buffer folding and collapsing to annotate folds.

  __0x0040__
  
  >  The line is protected. A protected line may be deleted or edited
     however it is not possible to split or join a protected line with any
     other line. This is used by the folding or collapse mechanisms to
     protect [narrrow](narrow-buffer(2)) regions from editing operations.

  __0x0080-0x0800__
  
  >  User defined. Users may use the upper most bits from left to right.
     JASSPA may use more bits in future releases which shall be consumed
     from the lower bits, right to left.

  __0xf000__
  
  >  The shifted [$line-scheme(5)]($line-scheme(5)) setting. A value of zero indicates that
     there is no line scheme in effect on the line.

  Where a bit flag is defined as read only then an attempt by the user to
  set a read-only bit then the bit setting is ignored, any remaining
  writable bits are set as requested.

! 5 $user-name
## NAME


  $user-name - MicroEmacs user name
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$user-name__


## DESCRIPTION


  __$user-name__ is the name of the MicroEmacs user. The name is used for
  identifying  user configuration  files  such  as  _$user-name___.emf__ and
  _$user-name___.erf__, the start-up [user](UserProfiles(2)) macro file and [erf(8)](erf(8)) registry file
  that contains saved user preferences.

  The __$user-name__ is determined as follows, in order of precedence:

  - The [me(1)](me(1)) command line option __-u__ _username_.
  - The environment variable [MENAME(5)]($MENAME(5)) (alternatively via `$LOGNAME` on
        Microsoft Windows platforms ONLY).
  - The name determined from the system. On UNIX then the `/etc/passwd`
        entry is used, on MicroSoft Windows then the login name is used.
  - When no other name is located then `user` is used (MS-DOS and
        Microsoft Windows environments running without a login mechanism).

  For most conventional _login_ systems then the correct login name is
  retrieved and it is not necessary to over-ride the name, unless a special
  configuration of MicroEmacs is being used.


## NOTES


  The user should not attempt to write to __$user-name__, the variable should be
  controlled through the aforementioned techniques.

  __$user-name__ was first introduced into MicroEmacs in the 2004 release.

! 5 $user-path
## NAME


  $user-path - MicroEmacs user directory
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$user-path__


## DESCRIPTION


  __$user-path__ is the name of the MicroEmacs user directory where user
  configuration files such as [$user-name]($user-name(5))__.emf__, [$user-name]($user-name(5))__.erf__ and personal
  spelling dictionaries are stored. This is an absolute directory path and
  is always terminated with a directory separator character '`/`'.

  The value of the variable is determined when the editor is started as
  follows:

  - The environment variable [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)) is defined, the __$user-path__
        is set to this value. If the environment $MEUSERPATH is defined
        without a trailing '/' then it is automatically added.
  - The environment variable [$MEPATH(5)]($MEPATH(5)) is defined and [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)) is
        undefined. The first directory in the $MEPATH variable is used as
        the $user-path directory.
  - The directory is determined from the system:
     __UNIX__: the home directory from `/etc/passwd` entry is used and appended
     with `.jasspa` i.e. `$HOME/.jasspa`, if the sub-directory [$user-name]($user-name(5)) is
     detected in this directory then it is used instead
     (`$HOME/.jasspa/$user-name`).  
     __Microsoft Windows__: the user application data directory is obtained
     from the system and appended with `jasspa` i.e. `$APPDATA/jasspa`. If the
     sub-directory [$user-name]($user-name(5)) is detected in this directory then it is used
     instead (`$APPDATA/jasspa/$user-name`).  
     __MS-DOS__ and older versions of __Microsoft__ __Windows__ without _Internet_
     _Explorer_ _4.0_ then a sub-directory [$user-name]($user-name(5)) of the program directory
     [$progname(5)]($progname(5)) is used.

  For most conventional _login_ systems then the correct user path is
  retrieved and it is not necessary to over-ride the pathname, unless a
  special configuration of MicroEmacs is being used. Where the user
  directory is to be manually specified then [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)) is the preferred
  method.


## NOTES


  The user should not attempt to write to __$user-path__, the variable should be
  controlled through the aforementioned techniques.

  __$MEUSERPATH__ _<path>_  


## DESCRIPTION


  These environment variables control the run-time search paths for
  MicroEmacs and affect the operation of [$search-path(5)]($search-path(5)) and [$user-path(5)]($user-path(5)),
  the macro search path and user macro directory respectively.

  __$MEINSTALLPATH__ is an environment variable that overrides any internally
  defined search path for MicroEmacs system macros and defines the root
  directory(s) of the MicroEmacs system macros. The presence of the
  environment variable affects [$search-path(5)]($search-path(5)).

  The environment variable __$MEINSTALLPATH__ is ignored if __$MEPATH__ is defined.
  The search path is always included after any user path defined by
  [$user-name(5)]($user-name(5)).

  __$MEUSERPATH__ is an environment variable that defines the users private
  directory where user configuration files such as [$user-name]($user-name(5))__.emf__,
  [$user-name]($user-name(5)).erf and personal spelling dictionaries are stored. This is an
  absolute directory path. The environment variable sets the MicroEmacs
  variable [$user-name(5)]($user-name(5)).

  __$MEPATH__ is an environment variable that may be used to define the absolute
  search path for MicroEmacs macro files and affects the setting of
  __$search-path__. The path should include the system macros location(s) and
  should include the user directory location [$user-path(5)]($user-path(5)) as the first path
  when the environment variable [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)) is not defined. If
  __$MEUSERPATH__ is defined then this path name appears before the __$MEPATH__
  variable to define the user directory location. __$MEPATH__ is not searching,
  so ALL all directories to be searched must be included in the path
  specification.

  [$MEUSERPATH(5)]($MEUSERPATH(5)) is the preferred method used to defined the user directory.


## Search Paths 


  MicroEmacs needs to know the installation directory location(s) of its
  macro files when it executes, this includes both user defined and system
  macros. MicroEmacs performs a searching operation of well-known directory
  locations where it may expect to find these macros at start up, the
  locations that it has found are saved in macro variables [$user-path(5)]($user-path(5)) and
  [$search-path(5)]($search-path(5)) and are used to subsequently locate files thereafter. The
  environment variables defined here allow that default search process to be
  modified by the user or system administrator.

  Directories are specified as _searching_ if a search operation is performed.
  The following sub-directories of a base directory are searched for the
  existence of subdirectories:

  > _._ - root directory.  
    [$user-name]($user-name(5)) - private user directory.  
    _company_ - company files.   
    _macros_ - JASSPA standard macros.  
    _spelling_ - spelling dictionaries.  

  MicroEmacs performs a searching operation on some directories to locate
  information. Generally, if the directory exists then it is included in the
  search path, otherwise it is excluded. Any subdirectories that are found
  are added in the order presented above. The [$search-path]($search-path(5)) is ONLY evaluated
  at start-up therefore directories created after MicroEmacs is running are
  not detected until the editor is closed down and re-started.


## UNIX 


  The defined search paths for UNIX are defined as follows:-

  Default install directories:-

  >  _/opt/jasspa_ - searching (SunOS, HP-UX, AIX and IRIX only)  
     _/usr/share/jasspa_ - searching  
     _/usr/local/share/jasspa_ - searching (BSD systems only)  
     _/usr/local/jasspa_ - searching  

  The default user location is defined as follows.

  >  _$(passwd-home)/.jasspa_ - searching

  MicroEmacs searches for user defined configuration files in this directory
  and will write new user configuration files to this directory. The
  behaviour of the search may be over-ridden by setting some environment
  variables.

  `$MEUSERPATH` - not searching
  
  >  Specified as a single pathname and redefines the _$user-path_ where user
     macros are placed, this overrides the _$(passwd-home)/.jasspa_ directory
     location.

  `$MEINSTALLPATH` - searching
  
  >  Specified as multiple pathname components and overrides the default
     install directory location (i.e. `/usr/local/jasspa`, etc. Typically
     used when the system macro directory has been install in another
     location that is not included in the default search path. This does
     not affect the user directory location.

  `$MEPATH` - not searching
  
  >  Overrides the _$(passwd-home)/.jasspa_ and default search paths
     (including `$MEINSTALLPATH`), MicroEmacs will use this directory as the
     search path. The user directory is assumed to be the FIRST directory
     path in the string unless the `$MEUSERPATH` environment variable is
     defined which specifies the user path.


## Microsoft Windows 


  The defined search paths for WINDOWS are defined as follows:-

  >   Default search locations:-

  >  _Executable directory location_ - searching

  The default user location is defined as follows. MicroEmacs searches for
  user defined configuration files in this directory and will write new user
  configuration files to this directory.

  >   _$APPDATA\jasspa_ - not searching

  If the system does not define a user application data location (__Win95__ and
  __Win32s__) then a directory [$user-name]($user-name(5)) or the executable location is used.

  The behaviour may be over-ridden by setting the environment variables as
  follows:

  `$MEUSERPATH` - not searching
  
  >  Specified as a single pathname and redefines the users home directory,
     this overrides the _$APPDATA\jasspa_ directory location.

  `$MEINSTALLPATH` - searching
  
  >  Specified as multiple pathname components and overrides the default
     install directory location. Typically used when the macro directory
     has been install in another location that is not in the same directory
     as the executable. This does not affect the user directory location.

  `$MEPATH` - not searching
  
  >  Overrides the _$APPDATA\jasspa_ and default search paths. MicroEmacs
     will use the FIRST directory path as the [$user-path]($user-path(5)) unless `$MEUSERPATH`
     is defined.


## MS-DOS 


  MS-DOS does not include a concept of a user name or user directory.

  >  Default search locations:-

  >  _Executable directory location_ - searching

  If a sub-directory exists at the executable location with name [$user-name]($user-name(5))
  then this is used as [$user-path]($user-path(5)), otherwise the execution directory
  location is used.

  The behaviour may be over-ridden using the environment variables.

  `$MEUSERPATH` - not searching
  
  >  Specified as a single pathname and redefines the [$user-path]($user-path(5)) overriding
     the _executable_ directory location.

  `$MEINSTALLPATH` - searching
  
  >  Specified as multiple pathname components and overrides the default
     executable directory location. Typically used when the macro directory
     has been installed at a different location that is not in the same
     directory as the executable. This does not affect the user directory
     location.

  `$MEPATH` - not searching
  
  >  Overrides the _Executable..._ and default search paths (including
     `$MEINSTALLPATH`). MicroEmacs will use FIRST directory path as the
    [$user-path]($user-path(5)) unless $MEUSERPATH is defined.

## NAME


|$indent-width
  $indent-width - Global indentation width in characters
|$buffer-indent-width
  $buffer-indent-width - Buffer indentation width in characters
$a


## SYNOPSIS


  __$indent-width__  
  __$buffer-indent-width__  


## DESCRIPTION


  __$indent-width__ defines the default indentation width assumed by the editor,
  this defines the number of characters the [indent(2)](indent(2)) command should use for
  indenting text. Once the value is set then all new buffers that are
  subsequently created assume an indent value of __$indent-width__. The default
  value when omitted is 4 characters.

  __$buffer-indent-width__ specifies the indent to use in a buffer, the value of
  __$indent-width__ is used as a default when the buffer is created.
  Modification of the __$buffer-indent-width__ value causes the buffer
  indentation width to be modified. The value is typically set by the
  __fhook-xxx__ macro when initializing a buffer using the [Language Templates](languageTemplates(2)).


## NOTES


  __$buffer-indent-width__ and __$indent-width__ were introduced into MicroEmacs in
  November 2004.

## NAME


  $mode-chars - Mode characters


## SYNOPSIS


  __$mode-chars__


## DESCRIPTION


  __$mode-chars__ is a read-only variable that returns a string that contains
  all of the buffer mode characters. The variable is typically used in the
  macros to determine the integer value of a buffer mode, the string is
  defined as follows:

       AaBbcYzdDeEfHIJkMnNOPQrSTtU12345678VW


  The index into the string matches [$show-modes(5)]($show-modes(5)).

! 5 $quiet
## NAME


  $quiet - Quiet mode control variable


## SYNOPSIS


  __$quiet__


## DESCRIPTION


  __$quiet__ is variable that controls the audible and visual warnings. When the
  variable is set to 0 then quiet mode is disabled, when set to 1 then quiet
  mode is enabled.

  When quiet mode is enabled, visual warnings are given instead of the
  default audible warning. This mode can only be globally changed, an error
  will occur if an attempt is made to change the mode for a buffer.

  The default state is on, so users of MicroEmacs can relax in the knowledge
  that they will not annoy other people when things go wrong.

  When disabled the system bell is rung when required, otherwise the usual
  visual warning is the "[BELL]" string, printed on the bottom right hand
  side.

## NAME


  eaf - MicroEmacs abbreviation file format


## SYNOPSIS


  _<pattern> <insertionString>_  
  _<pattern> <insertionString>_  
  _<pattern> <insertionString>_  
  _<pattern> <insertionString>_  


## DESCRIPTION


  The MicroEmacs 2009 abbreviation file, typically given the extension __.eaf__,
  defines a set of shorthand expansion strings which are used by the command
  [expand-abbrev(2)](expand-abbrev(2)). [buffer-abbrev-file(2)](buffer-abbrev-file(2)) defines the abbreviation file.

  The abbreviation file line based, with one abbreviation per line, with no
  intervening blank lines. Each line comprises of two columns, the first
  column _<pattern>_ identifies the source pattern to be expanded, the second
  column _<insertionString>_ defines the replacement text. The two text
  columns are separated by a space character.

  When [expand-abbrev(2)](expand-abbrev(2)) is invoked and the expansion _<pattern>_ is
  recognized, then _<pattern>_ is deleted from the buffer and replaced with
  _<insertionString>_.

  The fields are defined as follows:-

  _<pattern>_
  
  >  The source pattern to be expanded. The data commences in text column 0
     and spans to the first white space character (`SPACE` or `tab`). The
     pattern may not include any white space characters.

  _<insertionString>_
  
  >  The replacement string exists from the first non-white space character
     following the _<pattern>_ to the end of the line. The replacement string
     may include special tokens, delimited by a backslash ('`\`') character
     which are interpreted as follows:-

  >   __\B__ Move cursor backwards
  
  > >   A positioning control. Allows the cursor to be moved backwards 1
        character.

  >   __\d__ Delete `tab` backwards
  
  > >   Back tab. Deletes a tab character backwards.

  >   __\m"__<string>" Macro execution
  
  > >   Takes the remainder of the line as a keyboard macro definition.
        The macro string is generated using [insert-macro(2)](insert-macro(2)) and must be
        contained in double quotes. When invoked the keyboard macro is
        executed and the appropriate text is inserted into a buffer. This
        is typically only used for more complex operations.

  >   __\p__ Position
  
  > >   The resultant position of the cursor following the expansion. If
        the cursor position is not specified, the cursor is placed at the
        end of the expansion string by default.

  >   __\r__ Carriage Return (Newline)
  
  > >   A newline in the replacement text. Note while [indent(2m)](indent(2m)) is
        enabled a sequence a single "\r" retains the indent on the next
        line, however a sequence of two "\r\r" characters does not retain
        the tab position and returns the cursor to the start of the second
        line. If blank lines are required retaining tab positioning then a
        keyboard macro string should be used instead. (see "\m" above).

  >   __\t__ Tab
  
  > >   A tab character in the replacement text.


## EXAMPLE


  The following example provides abbreviations for the 'C' programming
  language, found in file __c.eaf__. All cursor positions in the examples are
  shown by __<@>__.

      #i "#include <\p>\r"
      #d "#define \p"
      if "if(\p)\r{\r\r}\r"
      ef "else if(\p)\r{\r\r}\r"
      el "else\r{\r\p\r}\r"
      wh "while(\p)\r{\r\r}\r"
      sw "switch(\p)\r{\rcase :\rdefault :\r}\r"


  Given that the abbreviation file has been declared then expansion of:

      #d<@>       =>      #define <@>
 
      if<@>       =>      if(<@>)
                             {
 
                             }
 
      sw<@>       =>      switch(<@>)
                             {
                             case :
                             default :
                             }


  Note, in all of the examples, the abbreviation replacement strings specify
  a resultant cursor position, typically where the next edit will take
  place.

  The macros may alternatively be defined using keyboard macros. The
  aforementioned macros could have been re-written with the following
  definitions which are equivalent:-

      #i \m"#include <\CX\CAP>\CM\CXaP\CX)"
      #d \m"#define \CX)"
      if \m"if(\CX\CAP)\CM{\CM}\CXaP\CX)"
      ef \m"else if(\CX\CAP)\CM{\CM\CM}\CM\CXaP\CX)"
      el \m"else\CM{\CM\CX\CAP\CM}\CM\CXaP\CX)"
      wh \m"while(\CX\CAP)\CM{\CM\CM}\CM\CXaP\CX)"
      sw \m"switch(\CX\CAP)\CM{\CMcase :\CMdefault:\CM}\CM\CXaP\CX)"


  Within a macro, the cursor positioning is generally achieved by setting a
  mark where the resultant cursor is to be positioned (see [set-mark(2)](set-mark(2))),
  when the macro is finished then an [exchange-point-and-mark(2)](exchange-point-and-mark(2)) is initiated
  to move the cursor to the correct position; alternatively a sequence of
  cursor movements may be used.

  The "\B" and "\d" are typically used for positioning the cursor on
  subsequent lines. "\d" is the inverse of "\t". Consider the following
  Pascal definition for an _else_, _begin_ and _end_ sequence:-

       el "else\rbegin\r\t\p;\r\dend;"


  with [indent(2m)](indent(2m)) mode enabled generates:-

                 else
                 begin
                     <@>;
                 end;


  Similarly the "\B" is typically used when [indent(2m)](indent(2m)) is enabled, but when
  the tab spacing is known. Consider the following example used in the
  MicroEmacs 2009 __.emf__ files to define a help entry. In this case the indent
  is known to be 5 characters. Hence to move the cursor back 5 characters
  then a sequence of __\B__'s are used:- 

      !h "def .. \rSEE ALSO\r     <cross references>\r\B\B\B\B!ehelp"


  the expansion in this case is:-

      define-help "<@>"
 
      ...
 
      SEE ALSO
              <cross references>
      !ehelp


## FILES


  The default abbreviation files are located in the MicroEmacs 2009 _home_
  directory.

  User's may specify their own abbreviation files by shadowing the _home_
  directory file with their own file located in a personal MicroEmacs 2009
  directory. See [$user-path(5)]($user-path(5)).

! 8 etf
## NAME


  etf - MicroEmacs template file format


## SYNOPSIS


  _<Free Form Text>_


## DESCRIPTION


  The MicroEmacs 2009 template file, typically given the extension __.etf__, is
  a file template for a new file and defines common text that is
  automatically included when a new file is created.

  The file inclusion is usually performed by macro [etfinsrt(3)](etfinsrt(3)), called from
  the [File Hooks](fileHooks(2)). The template file has no specific format, although
  __etfinsrt__ replaces key strings with relevant information.


## EXAMPLE


  The template file is inserted with the file hooks. If a file hook is
  called with an argument of `0` then the buffer has been created and the
  template file is inserted.

```{.emf}
        define-macro fhook-c
            ; if arg is 0 this is a new file so add template
            !if &not @#
                ; Is it an include h file or a c file?
                !if &seq &mid $buffer-bname &rsin "." $buffer-bname 1 "h"
                    etfinsrt "h"
                !else
                    etfinsrt "c"
                !endif
            !endif
            1 buffer-mode "time"
            .
            .
        !emacro

```
  See [etfinsrt(3)](etfinsrt(3)) for more information on how the template file is located
  and inserted into the buffer.

  The default MicroEmacs 2009 'C' mode template is defined as follows, but
  may be replaced with any other text:-

## SYNOPSIS


## DESCRIPTION


  The MicroEmacs 2009 macro files are ASCII text files, given the file
  extension __.emf__. A number of special macro files exist as follows:-

  __me.emf__
  
  >  The start-up macro file. This file is the first macro file to be
     invoked and is used to bootstrap MicroEmacs 2009 into the correct
     configuration.

  __hk___<name>___.emf__
  
  >  Macro files prefixed with __hk__ generally denote [File Hook](fileHooks(2)) macro files
     which are automatically invoked when known file types are loaded.

  _<logname>___.emf__
  
  >  The users start-up configuration file, typically used to configure the
     environment with the users preferences.

  _*___term.emf__
  
  >  Platform specific configuration files, used to configure the
     environment for a specific platform.

  Macro files may be any name, the more prominent macro files are:-

  __color.emf__
  
  >  Color definitions for the buffers.

  __mouse.emf__
  
  >  Mouse interaction macros.

  __osd.emf__
  
  >  OSD Menu configuration file.


## FILES


  The default start-up file __me.emf__ is located in the MicroEmacs 2009 _home_
  directory [$user-path(5)]($user-path(5)).

  User's may create their own start-up and files in their local MicroEmacs
  2009 directory. The users start-up file is called [$user-name]($user-name(5))__.emf__, and may
  be used to execute other macro files defined by the user.

## NAME


  erf - MicroEmacs registry file


## SYNOPSIS


  _; Comment to the end of the line_  
  _<command>_ ::= __"___<identifier>___"__ [ __=__ __"___<string>___"__ ][ __{__ _<command>_ __}__ ] *  


## DESCRIPTION


  MicroEmacs 2009 registry files are ASCII text files, given the file
  extension __.erf__. The registry file is a simple syntax that allows an
  _identifier_ to be associated with a _string_. The _identifiers_ are unique and
  allow a _string_ value to be found when a search for a _identifier_ is made.
  The _string_ component is optional.

  The syntax allows the _identifier_'s to be hierarchically nested, children
  of the _identifier_ node are enclosed in a set of curly braces __{__ ... __}__. The
  enclosure itself comprises a number of _identifiers_, which may have their
  own enclosures, and so on.

  The backslash character ``\`' is the escape character, the following
  sequences of escape character are recognized:-

      `\\` - Literal backslash
      `\"` - Double quote (used within a quoted string)
      `\n` - New line character.
      `\t` - Tab character.

  The semi-colon character ``;`' introduces a comment which exists to the end
  of the line.


## EXAMPLE


  The following is an example of a registry file:-

      ; -!- erf -!-
      ; Comment on this line
      "dos"
      {
             "file-ignore" = "~ ./ .o"
             "font" = "85"
             "mail-dir" = "c:/mail/"
             "mail-send" = "echo from \"%f\" file \"%o\""
             "mail-src" = "c:/mail/jon"
             "nested"="value"
             {
                 "foo"="bar"
             }
      }


  The history file _username.erf_ is a good example of the use of the
  registry. This file retains historical session information in The history
  registry file is automatically written at the end of a editing session
  when the editor is closed down (or may be saved explicitly using
  [save-session(3)](save-session(3))).

  Every user should have their own personal history file in their personal
  MicroEmacs directory. The history file is located from the MicroEmacs 2009
  search path defined by [$user-path(5)]($user-path(5)), and is named by the variable
  [$user-name(5)]($user-name(5)).


## NOTES


  - The registry files are not currently written with a backup.
  - Special care should be taken when editing registry files when they
    are loaded into MicroEmacs. It is recommended that the registry file
    is not loaded as a registry item when editing the registry text
    file.

  To edit the history registry file within MicroEmacs then the following
  sequence of steps should be followed:-

  - Save the current session [save-session(3)](save-session(3)).
  - Load the history registry file _username_.erf.
  - Edit the file.
  - Save edits back to the file.
  - Re-install the history [read-session(3)](read-session(3)). This flushes the current
    session and restores it from the file. The new edits should now be
    in the registry.
  - Examine the loaded registry using [list-registry(2)](list-registry(2)).

## NAME


  ehf - MicroEmacs help file


## SYNOPSIS


  __!___<helpTag>_  
  _<Text Description>_  
  ...  
  __|___<helpId>_  
  _<Text Description Line>_  
  ...  
  __$___?_  
  ...  
  _<Text Description>_  
  __!___<helpTag>_  
  __!___<helpTag>_  
  _<Text Description>_  
  ...  


## DESCRIPTION


  The on-line help information is retained in the file __me.ehf__, this is an
  ASCII text file which holds all of the on-line help information. The help
  file comprises of formatted text _<Text Description>_ which is literally
  displayed to the user when help information is requested. Each text
  description is delimited into pages with a __!___<helpTag>_ which identifies the
  block of text with a help label.

  The __!___<helpTag>_ is placed before the text description and is identified by
  a exclamation mark (`__!__') placed at the beginning of the line. The
  _<helpTag>_ is the identifying name used by the help system and takes the
  following form:

      `LSSNNNN...`

  Where:

  __L__
  
  >  Is the length of the "`NNNN...`" name which must be matched, a value of
     '` `' indicates that the whole name must be matched, otherwise the value
     must be in the range '`1`' - '`9`' indicating the number of characters to
     be match.

  __SS__
  
  >  Is the section number of the page, the first character should be a
     numeric (i.e. '`3`' for a macro) and the second is an optional section
     letter. A value of '` `' indicates no section number and/or letter.

  __NNNN...__
  
  >  The page name, the length is unlimited but must be on one line.

  Multiple _<helpTag>_'s may be associated with a common text description by
  proceeding a block of text with multiple tags, each on a separate line,
  with no intervening non-tag lines (i.e. lines that do not commence with
  __!__).

  The _<Text Description>_ that follows is the text associated with the tag.
  When the help system is invoked with the tag then the text is displayed.
  There are 2 types of internal command lines, lines starting with a '`|`'
  indicate that the following line should only be displayed if the requested
  help page is _<helpId>_, where _<helpId>_ is the the name used in the
  _<helpTag>_. This is a useful mechanism for pages with multiple _<helpTag>_s.

  Lines which contain just "`$?`" are MicroEmacs command lines where `?` can be:

  `a`
  
  >  For a command help page display any global key bindings, for variables
     display its current value.

  MicroEmacs uses a special hilighting scheme to control color schemes and
  hyper-text links, the special embedded tags all start with and escape
  character (0x1b or '`^[`') and are defined as follows:

  `^[c?`
  
  >  Tag used to change color where `?` can be:
   
            A  white, used for main text.
            B  red, used for underlining.
            C  green, used for italic font.
            D  cyan, used for bold font.
            E  light yellow, used for a header.
            F  light red, used for and image link.

  `^[s?`
  
  >  Tag used to change hilighting scheme where `?` can be:
  
            A  Normal ehf hilight.
            B  MicroEmacs macro (or emf) hilighting.
  
  >  Note that other tags can only be used in the normal ehf hilighting
     scheme.

  `^[ls<link>^[lm<name>^[le`
  
  >  Used to create hyper-links, `<link>` is the help link name which can be
     omitted if it is the same as `<name>`. `<name>` should not contain any
     other tags, it is automatically displayed in the magenta color scheme.


## NOTES


  When the help system is invoked for the first time, __me.ehf__ is loaded into
  internal memory and fragmented into labeled pages using the _<helpTag>_
  information. Hence, any edits made to __me.emf__ are not visible in the help
  system until the next session.

  Macros and alike may add additional help information to the internal help
  database at run-time using the [define-help(2)](define-help(2)) command.

  The help hilighting is applied to the help buffer from the hilighting
  macro's defined in __hkhelp.emf__. The hilighting is NOT part of the help
  file.

  Special hilighting keys may be included in __me.ehf__ provided that they are
  interpreted by the help hilighting defined in __hkehf.emf__.

  _<Text Description>_ lines cannot commence with __!__, __|__ or __$__ in the first
  column.


## EXAMPLE


  The following help entry defines the help for [global-mode(2)](global-mode(2)),
  [add-global-mode(3)](add-global-mode(3)) and [delete-global-mode(3)](delete-global-mode(3)). It uses most features
  mentioned, namely multiple link names, color and scheme changes and
  several hyper-text links:

      ! 3 add-global-mode
      ! 3 delete-global-mode

            ^[cDglobal-mode^[cA changes the state of one of the hereditary
            global modes. A buffer's modes are initialized to the global
            modes when first created. This command is very useful in changing
            some of the default behavior such as case sensitive searching (see
            the example below). See ^[ls^[lmOperating Modes^[le for a full list
            and description of modes. Also see ^[ls^[lmbuffer-mode(2)^[le for a
            full description of the use of the argument ^[cCn^[cA.

            The ^[ls^[lminfo(2)^[le command gives a list of the current global
            and buffer modes.

            ^[cDadd-global-mode^[cA and ^[cDdelete-global-mode^[cA are macros
            defined in me3_8.emf which use global-mode to add or remove a global
            mode. They are defined for backward compatibility and for ease of
            use; they are simple macros, add-global-mode is defined as follows:
      ^[sB
                define-macro add-global-mode
                    ; Has the require mode been given as an argument, if so add it
                    !force 1 global-mode @1
                    !if &not $status
                        ; No - use 1 global-mode to add a mode
                        !nma 1 global-mode
                    !endif
                !emacro

            default:

            Globally adding ^[ls^[lmbinary(2m)^[le and ^[ls^[lmcrypt(2m)^[le
            modes is strongly discouraged as any file loaded would be assigned
            these modes. Instead the use of commands ^[ls^[lmfind-bfile(3)^[le
            and ^[ls^[lmfind-cfile(3)^[le are recommended.

## PLATFORM


  __Microsoft Windows environments only__


## DESCRIPTION


  __me32.ini__ is the Microsoft Windows configuration file, located in the
  windows directory (typically __C:\Windows__ or __C:\WINNT__), the __me32.ini__ file is
  primarily used to counteract the deficiencies of Windows shell environment
  (as compared with UNIX) with respect to the initialization of environment
  variables. The __me32.ini__ file is comparable to the UNIX _.Xdefaults_ and
  _.profile_ files.

  The configuration file is split into two sections, a __Defaults__ section,
  which defines system settings and a __User__ section which define settings on
  a per user basis. Both sections allow environment variables to be defined
  for export. The _defaults_ section is executed first and then the _user_
  section which matches the users name. The format of both sections is
  identical.


## Section Keywords 


  The keywords identified in each section are defined as follows:-

  __mepath__
  
  >  Equivalent to the setting of the variable [$MEPATH(5)]($MEPATH(5)) to define the
     directory (or folder) location of the MicroEmacs 2009 default
     configuration files. If the assignment string is empty then any
     previous value is removed.

  __meinstallpath__
  
  >  Equivalent of setting the environment variable [$MEINSTALLPATH(5)]($MEINSTALLPATH(5)) to
     define the directory (or folder) location of the macros directory. If
     the assignment string is empty then any previous value is removed.

  __mename__
  
  >  The MicroEmacs [$user-name(5)]($user-name(5)) to use rather than the login name. If the
     assignment string is empty then any previous value is removed.

  __meuserpath__
  
  >  The value of [$user-path(5)]($user-path(5)). If the assignment string is empty then any
     previous value is removed.

  __geometry__=_<width>___x___<depth>_+_<xoffset>_+_<yoffset>_
  
  >  The geometry of the window the width and height are specified in
     character, the position of the window is specified as an offset. If
     the assignment string is empty then any previous preset value is
     removed.

  All other variables (except those commencing with `msdev` which are reserved
  for [memsdev(1)](memsdev(1))) are pushed into the environment as environment variables
  which are made during the editing session.


## Location Section 


  The location section, labeled __[Location]__, identifies the location of
  MicroEmacs 2009, and is typically used by other components to find and
  launch MicroEmacs. The section includes the following keys:-

  __exe__
  
  >  The absolute pathname to the MicroEmacs 2009 executable image.
     External programs such as [memsdev(1)](memsdev(1)) may use this entry to find the
     executable. This section may be omitted.


## Defaults Section 


  The default section, labeled __[MeYYMMDD]__ or __[Defaults]__ define the global
  variable settings for all users. The dated form is searched for first, the
  date corresponds to the specific version of MicroEmacs as displayed by
  [about(2)](about(2)). When omitted then the [Defaults] section is used. Either, or
  both sections may be omitted.


## User Section 


  The __User Section__ is executed after the __Defaults Section__. The __User Section__
  uses the [$user-name(5)]($user-name(5)) which is defined as follows:-

  - The environment variable [$MENAME(5)]($MENAME(5))
  - The _login name_ under Windows '95 or NT. If the _login name_ is defined
        then the variable [$user-name(5)]($user-name(5)) is set to this value.
  - The environment variable [$LOGNAME(5)]($LOGNAME(5)) if the _login name_ cannot be
        located.

  A single user section is executed that corresponds to the user. If the
  system does not use a login system then a __mename__ entry may be placed in
  the defaults section to force a name.

  A __mename__ entry appearing in the _user_ section is used to change the login
  name to a more sensible name when the user login and MicroEmacs user files
  use different names.


## EXAMPLE


  The following is an example of the __me32.ini__ file, there is no login and a
  user _John Doe_ defines his MicroEmacs user name:

       ; External locater for the executable
       [Location]
       exe=c:\Program Files\JASSPA\MicroEmacs\me32.exe
       ;
       ; Default global section
       [Defaults]
       ; mepath
       ; The location of the MicroEmacs common files.
       meinstallpath=d:\jasspa
       mename=john
       ;
       ; User John Doe
       [john]
       ; meuserpath - The location of the users MicroEmacs directory.
       meuserpath=d:\jasspa\john
       ; Define some environment variables.
       INFOPATH=c:\info


  Note that multiple users share the same __me32.ini__ file, each user may
  include their own configuration settings which may be interrogated in the
  configuration files. In the following example a user _John Doe_ with login
  name of _johndoe_ uses private configuration files called _john_:

       ; External locater for the executable
       [Location]
       exe=c:\Program Files\JASSPA\MicroEmacs\me32.exe
       ;
       ; Defaults for RC4 Release
       [Me040201]
       meinstallpath=d:\jasspa_rc4
       ;
       ; Default global section
       [Defaults]
       ; mepath
       ; The location of the MicroEmacs common files.
       meinstallpath=d:\jasspa
       ; Define some environment variables.
       INFOPATH=c:\info
       ;
       ; User John Doe
       [johndoe]
       ; meuserpath - The location of the users MicroEmacs directory.
       meuserpath=d:\jasspa\john
       ; mename - Use "john" instead of "johndoe"
       mename=john
       ; Define startup screen size.
       geometry=110x50+70+30
       ;
       ; User Jane Doe
       [janedoe]
       meuserpath=d:\jasspa\janedoe

## NAME


  .Xdefaults - UNIX Window Manager defaults file


## SYNOPSIS


  __MicroEmacs.font:__ _font_  
  __MicroEmacs.geometry:__ _char-width___x___char-height_ [__+-__]_xoffset_ [__+-__]_yoffset_  
  __MicroEmacs.name:__ _name_  
  __MicroEmacs.iconname:__ _name_  


## PLATFORM


  __UNIX environments only__


## DESCRIPTION


  __.Xdefaults__ is the UNIX X-Windows configuration file that permits some of
  the X-Windows start up settings to be configured. The file is typically
  loaded into the X database when the Window Manager starts and the values
  are read from the database by MicroEmacs at start up, over-riding any
  internal defaults.

  The __.Xdefaults__ file is used by other applications and MicroEmacs may be
  added to the end of any existing file.

  The values interpreted by MicroEmacs are defined as follows:

  __MicroEmacs.font:__ _font_
  
  >  Specifies the font to use.

  __MicroEmacs.geometry:__ _char-width___x___char-height_ [__+-__]_xoffset_ [__+-__]_yoffset_
  
  >  The geometry of the X-Window at start-up. _char-width_ and _char-height_
     define the width and depth of the frame specified in characters of the
     current font. _xoffset_ and _yoffset_ specify the position of the wind
     with respect to the top left of the screen, defaults are used when
     specified as 0.

  __MicroEmacs.name:__ _name_
  
  >  Over-rides the name prefix used in the X-Window title bar, by default
     this is specified as _MicroEmacs_.

  __MicroEmacs.iconname:__ _name_
  
  >  Over-rides the name prefix used in a X-Window iconic display, by
     default this is specified as _MicroEmacs_.


## EXAMPLE


  The following is an example of the __.Xdefaults__ file:-

      !######################################################################
      !#                                                                    #
      !# Defaults for MicroEmacs startup                                    #
      !#                                                                    #
      !######################################################################
      !# MicroEmacs.font: <fontname>
      !# Set the default font.
      MicroEmacs.font: -*-lucidatypewriter-medium-r-*-*-*-*-*-*-m-*-*-*
      !# MicroEmacs.font: -*-clean-medium-r-*-*-*-130-*-*-*-*-*-*

      !# MicroEmacs.geometry: <char-width>x<char-height> {+/-}<xoffset> {+-}<yoffset>
      !# Set up the default screen size and position.
      !# 102x65 characters please, 30 pixels from top left
      MicroEmacs.geometry: 102x65 30 30

      !# MicroEmacs.name: <name>
      !# The name displayed in the title bar format is <name>: <file>
      MicroEmacs.name: JASSPAs MicroEmacs

      !# MicroEmacs: <icon-name>
      !# The name displayed when MicroEmacs is iconized
      MicroEmacs.iconname: JASSPAs MicroEmacs


## NOTES


  The __.Xdefaults__ file is typically read once at login and and any changes to
  the files are not enacted until the Window Manager is re-started or a new
  login session commences.

  The settings in the __.Xdefaults__ may be subsequently overridden by the
  settings defined in [user-setup(3)](user-setup(3)).

## DESCRIPTION


  MicroEmacs 2009 session files are ASCII text files that retain all the
  buffer context for a previous editing session.

  Every user has their own personal session file in their personal
  MicroEmacs directory. The session file is located from the MicroEmacs 2009
  search path defined by [$user-path(5)]($user-path(5)), and is named by the variable
  [$user-name(5)]($user-name(5)).

  >  Recognized by GNU and MicroEmacs. Denotes a C++ programming type file,
     may be used in __.c__, __.def__ and __.h__ files.


## DESCRIPTION


  The __C__ and __C++__ file type templates offer the most sophisticated editing
  features within the MicroEmacs 2009 environment.

  __General Editing__
  
  >  On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
     the file. [time(2m)](time(2m)) is by default enabled, allowing the modification
     time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

  __Hilighting__
  
  >  The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
     preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
     language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

  __Auto Layout__
  
  >  The C-Mode indentation mode of [indent(2)](indent(2)) performs automatic layout of
     the text.

  >  [restyle-region(3)](restyle-region(3)) and [restyle-buffer(3)](restyle-buffer(3)) are available to reformat
     (re-layout) selected sections of the buffer, or the whole buffer,
     respectively.

  >  Comments may be formatted using `esc o`, which reformats the comments
     according to the current fill paragraph. If a comment commences with
     `/***...` then the comment is automatically formatted to a box. If the
     comment commentces with `/**` then the comment is assumed to be a _Java_
     _Doc_ comment.

  __Tags__
  
  >  A C-tags file may be generated within the editor using the __Tools__ -> C
     Tools -> __Create Tag File__. [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2)) takes the user to the file using
     the tag information.

  >  On invoking the tag generator then the user is presented with a dialog
     box which specifies the generation option of the tags file. The base
     directory of the tags file search and tagging options may be specified
     to locate all of the definitions within the code space.

  >  The __tags__ file is extremely useful where the user is dealing with
     inherited source code spread over multiple directories. Generation of
     a recursive tag file with all searching options enabled allows labels
     to be located extremely rapidly (certainly faster than IDE
     environments).

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the C and C++ files. The folds occur
     about braces __{__...__}__ located on the left-hand margin. [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3))
     (un)folds all regions in the file, [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) (un)folds the
     current region. Note that folding does not operate on K&R style code.

  >  The __Tools__ -> __C Tools__ menu allows `#define`'s to be evaluated within the
     buffer. Where the state of a `#if` is established to be false (using the
     `#define` information) then the disabled region of code is grayed out
     indicating which regions of the code are active.

  __Navigation via Item List__

  >  Item listing is available and the key constructs of the file may be listed
     using  the [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command.

  __Abreviations__

  >  The installation comes with a default abbreviation file for C and C++ file editing
     which can be used by writing short abbreviations like "_for_", "_if_" or "_wh_" (while) - 
     for C and C++ code functions. The list of abbreviations can be used as well interactively in the GUI
     version of MicroEmacs using the  [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) command.

  __Working Environment__
 
  >  [compile(3)](compile(3)) may be invoked to rebuild the source, the user is prompted
     to save any files.

  >  [rcs-file(2)](rcs-file(2)) is automatically invoked if an RCS file is detected, the
     normal check-in/out operations may be performed through the editor.

  __Short Cuts__
  
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __C-c C-c__ - Comment out the current line.  
     __C-c C-d__ - Uncomment the current line.  
     __C-c C-e__ - Comment to the end of the line with stars (*).  
     __A-C-i__ - Restyle the current region.  
     __esc q__ - Format a comment.  
     __esc o__ - Format a comment.  
     __f2__ - (un)fold the current region  
     __f3__ - (un)fold all regions  
     __f6__ - List items.  
     __esc f6__ - Close list items window.  

  __Additional Commands__
  
  >  A number of additional commands are available as follows:-

  >  [c-slashify(3)](c-slashify(3)) - Append backslash to end of lines of region.  
     [c-deslashify(3)](c-deslashify(3)) - Remove backslash to end of lines of region.  
     [c-to-cpp-convert(3)](c-to-cpp-convert(3)) - Convert a C file to C++ file.
     [c-hash-eval(3)](c-hash-eval(3)) - Evaluate C/C++ #defines.  
     [c-hash-del(3)](c-hash-del(3)) - Remove C/C++ #define evaluation.  
     [c-hash-set-define(3)](c-hash-set-define(3)) - Set a C/C++ #define.  
     [c-hash-unset-define(3)](c-hash-unset-define(3)) - Unset a C/C++ #define.  

  __Executing, Formatting and Linting__
  
  > __%fhook-c-exec__ - The command to execute the current C file, default on Unix systems
      is set to _"LANG=en_US gcc -Wall -std=c99 %f -o %b 2>&1 &&  ./%b"_ where _%f_ represents the file name and _%b_ the
      basename of the current file on Windows the slash is replaced with a backslash
            
  > __%fhook-c-format__ - The command to format current C file, default is set to 
      _"astyle %f"_ or _"clang-format %f -- -std=c99"_ in dependence what is installed 
      on the current system, again _%f_ represents the file name of the currently edited file.

  > __%fhook-c-lint__ - The command to check/lint the current C file, default is set to
      _"LANG=en_US gcc -Wall -x c -fsyntax-only %f"_ or _"clang-tidy %f -- -std=c99"_ if the latter
      is installed on the system. Again _%f_ represents the currently edited file name.

  > __%fhook-cpp-exec__ - The command to execute the current C++ file, default on Unix systems
      is set to _"LANG=en_US g++ -Wall -std=c++17 %f -o %b 2>&1 && ./%b"_ where _%f_ represents the file name and _%b_ the
      basename of the current file on Windows the slash is replaced with a backslash
            
  > __%fhook-cpp-format__ - The command to format current C++ file, default is set to 
      _"astyle %f"_ or _"clang-format %f --std=c++17"_ in dependence what is installed 
      on the current system, again _%f_ represents the file name of the currently edited file.

  > __%fhook-c++-lint__ - The command to check/lint the current C++ file, default is set to
      _"g++ -Wall -x c++ -fsyntax-only %f"_ or _"clang-tidy %f -- -std=c++17"_ if the latter
      is installed on the system. Again _%f_ represents the currently edited file name.
  
  > The setting assume that the mentioned compilers or tools are available via the _PATH_
    environment variable. On Windows you must insert here either the complete _PATH_ to the 
    executables or add the folder where these files are to the _PATH_ variable. 
    
  > These global variables should be changed if necessary usually within your _USERNAME.emf_ 
    or _myc.emf_ and _mycpp.emf_ files. 

## NOTES


  If the default language is C++, rather than 'C' the order of the file
  hooks should be over-ridden in the users local setup, using:-

```{.emf}
        add-file-hook ".c "                                  fhook-c
        add-file-hook ".cc .cpp .hpp .rc .h .def .l .y .i"   fhook-cpp

```

  This defaults all __.h__ and __.def__ files etc. to be C++ rather than C.

  The hilighting is typically extended using a file __myc.emf__ (or __mycpp.emf__)
  i.e. to include the usual extended types of __int32__ etc, __myc.emf__ might be
  defined as:-

```{.emf}
        hilight .hilight.c 1 "uint8"    .scheme.type
        hilight .hilight.c 1 "int8"     .scheme.type
        hilight .hilight.c 1 "uint16"   .scheme.type
        hilight .hilight.c 1 "int16"    .scheme.type
        hilight .hilight.c 1 "uint32"   .scheme.type
        hilight .hilight.c 1 "int32"    .scheme.type
        hilight .hilight.c 1 "float32"  .scheme.type
        hilight .hilight.c 1 "float64"  .scheme.type

```

## BUGS


  The 'C' and 'C++' templates have been throughly used, there are no known
  issues with the templates.

  The __.rc__ hilighting is a little bogus and should not really be mapped onto
  __.cpp__. Do not attept to re-style.

## DESCRIPTION


  The __emf__ file type template handles the hilighting of the MicroEmacs 2009
  macro files.

  __General Editing__
  
  >  On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
     the file. [time(2m)](time(2m)) is by default enabled, allowing the modification
     time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

  __Hilighting__
  
  >  The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logical, comments,
     strings and characters of the language to be differentiated and
     rendered in different colors.

  __Auto Layout__
  
  >  The [indentation mechanism](indent(2)) is enabled which performs performs automatic
     layout of the text. [restyle-region(3)](restyle-region(3)) and [restyle-buffer(3)](restyle-buffer(3)) are

     the whole buffer, respectively.

  __Tags__
  
  >  A C-tags file may be generated within the editor using the __Tools__ ->
     __Emf-Tools__ -> __Create Tag File__. [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2)) takes the user to the file
     using the tag information.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the __emf__ files. The folds occur about
     __define-macro__ and __!emacro__ text located on the left-hand margin.

  > - [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)) - (un)folds  all regions in the file, 
    - [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) - (un)folds the current region. 

  __Navigation via Item List__

## SYNOPSIS


  txt, doc - Plain text document file
 

## FILES


  __hkdoc.emf__ - Plain text hook definition


## EXTENSIONS


  __.txt__ - ASCII plain text file  
  __.doc__ - ASCII plain text document file


## DESCRIPTION


  The __doc__ file type template handles the hilighting and text formating of a
  plain text file. Within the text document justification and word wrapping
  are typically enabled. The template allows the user to format text as
  left, right, center or no justification.

  __Auto Layout__
  
  >  The automatic layout of the text is restricted to justification and
     wrapping and the detection of bulleted lists. [fill-bullet(5)]($fill-bullet(5)) may be
     used to determine the character set used for bullet points, on
     encountering a bullet the left-hand justification might be modified.

  __Formatting rules__
  
  >  The default mode of operation is automatic mode which attempts to
     retain the document style whenever a paragraph is re-formatted. This
     allows rapid entry of text into a reasonable format with no special
     formating character embedded in the text.

  >  The automatic formatting rules used by [fill-paragraph(2)](fill-paragraph(2)) in an
     automatic text mode are defined as follows:-

  >  Text on column 0
   
  > >   Text appearing in the first column is always assumed to be left
        justified, and non-wrapping, provided that the text does not
        extend to the [buffer fill column]($fill-col(5)). This is typically used for
        headers and addresses.

  >  Text on right edge
   
  > >   Text ending at the right edge (the [$buffer-fill-col(5)]($buffer-fill-col(5))), which
        commences from more that 50% of the page width is assumed to be
        right justified, non-wrapping. Typically used for addresses.

  >  Text centered

  > >   Text which is centered on the page is assumed to be centered, this
        is non-wrapping.

  >  Indented

  > >   All other text, not covered by the cases above is assumed to be
        available for filling. In this case the text is filled by the
        paragraph and left/right justification is applied, the fill
        default may be changed with [$buffer-fill-mode(5)]($buffer-fill-mode(5)) and changed with
        [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)).

  __Short Cuts__
  
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __C-c C-h__ - Help information on current mode.  
     __C-c C-s__ - Spell the buffer.  
     __C-c C-b__ - Fill both; perform left and right justification on the
                   margins.  
     __C-c C-b__ - Fill center; center the text on the current line.  
     __C-c C-l__ - Fill left; fill the text on the paragraph (ragged right
                   edge).  
     __C-c C-r__ - Fill right; place text on right margin.  
     __C-c C-o__ - Reduce a paragraph to a single line.  
     __C-c a__ - Move to automatic formatting mode (default).  
     __C-c l__ - Change mode to left formating  
     __C-c r__ - Change mode to right formating  
     __C-c r__ - Change mode to both formating  
     __C-c c__ - Change mode to center formating  
     __C-c n__ - Change mode to no formating  


## NOTES


  To move text to a word processor then it is advised that all paragraphs
  are reduced to single lines, leading white space should be deleted (any
  possibly blank lines) and then import to the word processor. This saves
  considerable time as the word processor styles may be applied without
  handling spaces and band end of line characters.


## MAGIC STRINGS


  __-!- document -!-__
  
  >  MicroEmacs specific tag, recognizes the file as a plain text document.
     No hilighting of the document is performed.

  __-!- document; sectioned -!-__
  
  >  MicroEmacs specific tag, recognizes the file as a document that
     contains sections. A crude section hilighting is enabled as follows:-

  >  Lines commencing with __>__ are assumed to be comments, typically used at
     the head of the document .

             > -!- document; sectioned -!-
             >
             > Author:       My Self
             > Created:      11/11/97
             > Modified:     <211197.1003>
             > Location:     /xx/yy/zz.doc


  >  All lines commencing with start (`*`) are assumed to be bullet lists.
     Bullet is hilighted.

  >  All lines commencing with `[a-zA-Z])` or `[0-9])` are assumed to be minor
     sections. The section number is hilighted. e.g.:

             a) text
             1) text


  >  All text in single or double quotes is hilighted, assumed to be
     literal text. and are hilighted i.e. This is a __"double quote"__ or __'a'__
     single quote.

  >  Lines commencing with underscore (`_`) are hilighted to the end.
     typically used as demarcation breaks or for section underlining

  __-!- Document; pseudo-code -!-__
  
  >  The document contains pseudo code, and the pseudo code is hilighted.
     The pseudo-code tokens are defined as follows:-

  >   __//__ introduces a comment to the end of the line.

  >  Command words comprise:-
   
            BEGIN, BREAK, CASE, CLEAR, CONTINUE, DO, DONE, ELIF, ELSE, END,
            ENDIF, FOR, FUNCTION, GOTO, IF, ONEVENT, ONINTERRUPT, PROCEDURE,
            REPEAT, RETURN, SET, SWITCH, THEN, TO, UNTIL, WHILE,

  >  Pseudo logical operators include
   
            AND, FALSE, MOD, NOT, OR, TRUE, XOR,

  __-!- document; sectioned; pseudo-code -!-__
  
  >  A combination of both of the above.


## BUGS


  The automatic mode sometimes mistakes an indented paragraph for a centered
  paragraph. This only typically occurs when the first line of the paragraph
  is not filled to the right. When the formatting error occurs, simply pad
  the line out so that it extends past the fill column and re-apply the
  formatting.

  Unfortunately there is nothing that can be done to alleviate this problem,
  but it occurs infrequently.

  The __f90__ file type templates provide simple hilighting of Fortran 77 and
  Fortran 90 files, the template provides minimal hilighting of both
  language syntaxes, which are overloaded into the same file.

  The major difference between the file types, apart from the new reserved
  words, is the comments. In Fortran 90 comments are introduced with __!__,
  while the other types use a __c__ in column 0.


  __General Editing__
  
  >  On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into

     layout of the text. [restyle-region(3)](restyle-region(3)) and [restyle-buffer(3)](restyle-buffer(3)) are
     available to reformat (re-layout) selected sections of the buffer, or
     the whole buffer, respectively.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the __f90__ files. The folds occur about
     __function__, __subroutine__, __program__,  and __end__ text located on the left-hand margin.

  > - [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)) - (un)folds  all regions in the file, 
    - [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) - (un)folds the current region. 

  __Navigation via Item List__

  >  The Fortan mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying
     an outline of the functions, subroutine, module and program definitions
     of the Fortran file for easy  navigation using the [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command.

     like   _"if"_  _"wh"_ (while), or _"fu"_ (function) - and then pressing
     the key-binding for the  [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3)) command.  
     The  list  of  abbreviations  can be used  interactively  in the GUI version of
     MicroEmacs using the [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) command.

  __Short Cuts__
  
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __C-c C-c__ - Comment out the current line.  
     __C-c C-d__ - Uncomment the current line.  
     __C-c esc esc __- Command complete.  
     __f2__ - (un)fold the current region  
     __f3__ - (un)fold all regions  
     __f6__ - Display the item list.
     __esc f6__ - Hide the item list.

  __Executing, Formatting and Linting__

  > __%fhook-fortran-exec__ - The command to execute the current Fortran file, 
      default on Unix systems  is set to _"gfortran %f -o %b && ./%b"_ where 
      _%f_ represents the file name and _%b_ the basename of the current file
      on Windows the slash is replaced with a backslash
            
  > __%fhook-fortran-format__ - The command to format current Fortran file,
      default is set to _"fprettify %f"_ if the program is installed. 
      On a Unix system you might install it using the Python package manager
      like this: _"pip3 install fprettify --user"_. If fprettify is not available
      the command [restyle-buffer(3)](restyle-buffer(3)) will be used instead.

  > __%fhook-fortran-lint__ - The command to check/lint the current Fortran file, 
       default is set to _"gfortran -fsyntax-only %f"_ where _%f_ represents
       the file name.
  
  > The setting assume that the Gnu Fortran compiler and the `fprettify` formatter
    is available via the _PATH_ environment variable. 
    On Windows you must insert here either the complete _PATH_ to the 
    `gfortran` executable or add the folder where this file is to the _PATH_ variable.

  > These global variables should be changed if necessary usually within your _USERNAME.emf_ 
    or the _myfortran.emf_ file. 


## BUGS


  The Fortran hilight file is in it's infancy and a number of it's tokens
  may be misplaced.

## DESCRIPTION


  The __pascal__ file type template provides simple hilighting of Pascal files,
  the template provides minimal hilighting.

  __Abbreviations__

  >  The  installation  comes with a default  abbreviation  file for Pascal file
     editing which  can  be  used  by  writing  short   abbreviations like
     "_fo_" (for), "_if_", "_el_" (else), "_pr_" (procedure)  or "_wr_" (writeln) - and then 
     pressing the key-binding  for the [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3)) command.

  >  The  list  of  abbreviations  can be used  interactively in the GUI version of
     MicroEmacs using the [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) command.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the Pascal files. The folds occur
     about  __type__, __function__ or __procedure__ keywords and a closing _end;_, all at the
     beginning of a line. 

  > - [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)) (un)folds all regions in the file, 
    - [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) (un)folds the current region. 

  __Navigation via Item List__

  >  The Pascal mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying an outline
     of the functions, procedures, records, objects and classes of the V file for easy navigation using the 
     [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command. 

  __Working Environment__
  
  >  [compile(3)](compile(3)) may be invoked to rebuild the source, the user is prompted
     to save any files.

     __A-C-i__ - Restyle the current region.  
     __esc q__ - Format a comment.  
     __esc o__ - Format a comment.  
     __f2__ - (Un)fold the current region.  
     __f3__ - (Un)fold all regions.  
     __f6__ - Display the item list.
     __esc f6__ - Hide the item list.

  __Executing, Formatting and Linting__
  
  > __%fhook-pascal-exec__ - The command to execute the current Pascal file, default on Unix systems
            is set to _"fpc %f && ./%b"_ where _%f_ represents the file name and _%b_ the
            basename of the current file on Windows the slash is replaced with a backslash
            
  > __%fhook-pascal-format__ - The command to format current Pascal file, default  
            is set to _"ptop %f temp.pas && cp temp.pas %f"_ on a Unix system
            where _%f_ represents the file name, on Windows the _cp_ command is
            replaced with _copy_
  > __%fhook-pascal-lint__ - The command to check/lint the current Pascal file, 
            default is set to _"fpc -Cn %f"_ where _%f_ represents the file name.
  
  > The setting assume that the Free Pascal compiler and the `ptop` formatter is available via the PATH
    environment variable. On Windows you must insert here either the complete PATH to the 
    `fpc` executable or add the folder where this file is to the PATH variable.

  > These global variables should be changed if necessary usually within your _USERNAME.emf_ 
    or the _mypascal.emf_ file.

  MicroEmacs 2009 recognizes the magic string on the first line of the
  file used to locate the executable. The shell files may be extension
  less and are still recognized. Note that this is the typical method of
  identifying shell files and will recognize other files not mentioned
  above i.e. __bash__ shells.


## DESCRIPTION


  The __shell__ file type template provides simple hilighting of the shell
  files.  It offers as well folding and support for displaying and outline
  of the functions of the shell script for easy navigation using the 
  [item-list(3)](item-list(3))  command and expanding abbreviations either via short 
  strings using the [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3)) command and visual
  inserting abbreviations using the [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) macro.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the Shell files. The folds occur about the
     function keyword and closing braces `function...{...}` located on the
     left-hand margin. The following commands are supported to show and hide
     the function bodies. 
     
  >  [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)) -  (un)folds all regions in the file,  
     [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) - (un)folds the current region.

  __List Items__

  >  Item listing is available and the key constructs of the file may be listed
     using  the [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command.

  __Abreviations__

  >  The installation comes with a default abbreviation file for shell editing
     which can be used by writing short abbreviations like "_for_", "_if_" or "_fun_" - 
     for a Bourne shell or Z-shell function - and then pressing the key-binding for
     the [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3))  command. The list
     of abbreviations can be used interactively in the GUI version of MicroEmacs
     using the  [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) command.

  __Short Cuts__
        
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __C-c C-c__ - Comment out the current line.  
     __C-c C-d__ - Uncomment the current line.  
     __C-c C-e__ - Comment to the end of the line with stars (*).  
     __A-C-i__   - Restyle the current region.  
     __esc q__   - Format a comment.  
     __esc o__   - Format a comment.  
     __f2__      - (un)fold the current region  
     __f3__      - (un)fold all regions
     __f6__      - show the item-list outline
     __Esc f6__  - hide the item-list outline

## NOTES

  The file hook is implemented in the  __shell.emf__  file, the  abbreviations
  are placed within  the __shell.eaf__ file, the template for the initialization
  of the new file is defined in the  __shell.etf__ file. To add your own
  abbreviations or your own template copy these files to your  config folder 
  and edit them within this folder.

## BUGS


  Functions  defined without using the function  keyword can't currenly folded
  and as well do not appear in the item-list outline.

  There is a heavy bias towards Bourne, Korn and Zsh shells. The author is
  not a csh shell user so has probably missed a lot of csh features.

  java - Java programming language templates


## FILES


  __hkjava.emf__ - Java programming language hook definition  
  __java.eaf__ - Java programming language abbreviatione file  
  __java.etf__ - Java programming language template file


## EXTENSIONS


  __.java__, __.jav__ - Java


## DESCRIPTION


  The __java__ file type templates share much with the [c(9)](c(9)) template
  definitions, utilising the electric 'C' features for automatic layout of
  text.

  __General Editing__
  
  >  On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
     the file. [time(2m)](time(2m)) is by default enabled, allowing the modification
     time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

  __Hilighting__
  
  >  The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
     preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
     language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

  __Auto Layout__
  
  >  The C-Mode [indent(2)](indent(2)) performs automatic layout of the text.

  >  [restyle-region(3)](restyle-region(3)) and [restyle-buffer(3)](restyle-buffer(3)) are available to reformat
     (re-layout) selected sections of the buffer, or the whole buffer,
     respectively.

  >  Comments may be formatted using `esc o`, which reformats the comments
     according to the current fill paragraph. If a comment commences with
     `/***...` then the comment is automatically formatted to a box.

  __Abreviations__

  >  The installation comes with a default abbreviation file for Java editing
     which can be used by writing short abbreviations like "_fo_", "_if_" or "_cl_" (class) 
     for Java classes functions. The list of abbreviations can be used as well interactively in the GUI
     version of MicroEmacs using the  [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) command.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the Java files. The folds occur
     about braces __{__...__}__ located on the left-hand margin. [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3))
     (un)folds all regions in the file, [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) (un)folds the
     current region. Note that folding does not operate on K&R style code,
     with the trailing open brace.

  __Tags__
  
  >  A c-tags file may be generated within the editor using the __Tools__ ->
     __Java-Tools__ -> __Create Tag File__. [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2)) takes the user to the file
     using the tag information.

  >  On invoking the tag generator then the user is presented with a dialog
     box which specifies the generation option of the tags file. The base
     directory of the tags file search and tagging options may be specified
     to locate all of the definitions within the code space.

  >  The __tags__ file is extremely useful where the user is dealing with
     inherited source code spread over multiple directories. Generation of
     a recursive tag file with all searching options enabled allows labels
     to be located extremely rapidly (certainly faster than IDE
     environments).

  __Working Environment__
  
  >  [compile(3)](compile(3)) may be invoked to rebuild the source, the user is prompted
     to save any files.

  >  [rcs-file(2)](rcs-file(2)) is automatically invoked if an RCS file is detected, the
     normal check-in/out operations may be performed through the editor.

  __Short Cuts__
  
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __C-c C-c__ - Comment out the current line.  
     __C-c C-d__ - Uncomment the current line.  
     __C-c C-e__ - Comment to the end of the line with stars (*).  
     __A-C-i__ - Restyle the current region.  
     __esc q__ - Format a comment.  
     __esc o__ - Format a comment.  
     __f2__ - (un)fold the current region  
     __f3__ - (un)fold all regions
     __f6__      - show the item-list outline
     __Esc f6__  - hide the item-list outline


## NOTES


  The hilighting is typically extended using a file __myjava.emf__

  >  The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
     preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
     language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

  __Auto Layout__
  
  >  The [indentation mechanism](indent(2)) is enabled which performs automatic layout
     of the text. [restyle-region(3)](restyle-region(3)) and [restyle-buffer(3)](restyle-buffer(3)) are available to
     reformat (re-layout) selected sections of the buffer, or the whole
     buffer, respectively.

  __Tags__
  
  >  A Tcl-tags file may be generated within the editor using the __Tools__ ->
     __Tcl-Tools__ -> __Create Tag File__. [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2)) takes the user to the file
     using the tag information.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the Tclfiles. The folds occur
     about procedures or class defintions located on the left-hand margin. 
     [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)) (un)folds all regions in the file, 
     [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) (un)folds the current region. 
     Note that folding does not operate on K&R style code.

  __Navigation via Item List__

  >  Item listing is available and the key constructs of the file may be listed
     using  the [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command.

  __Abreviations__

  >  The installation comes with a default abbreviation file for Tcl editing
     which can be used by writing short abbreviations like "_for_", "_if_" or "_proc_" - 
     for Tcl functions. More extended abbreviations are "_main_" for an Tcl
     application outline or "_oocl_" for an _oo::class_ template. The short strings
     are then replaced by pressing the key-binding for the [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3))
     command. The list of abbreviations can be used as well interactively in the GUI
     version of MicroEmacs using the  [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) command.

  __Short Cuts__
  
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __C-c C-c__ - Comment out the current line.  
     __C-c C-d__ - Uncomment the current line.  
     __C-c C-e__ - Comment to the end of the line with stars (*).  
     __A-C-i__ - Restyle the current region.  
     __f2__ - (un)fold the current region  
     __f3__ - (un)fold all regions  
     __f6__      - show the item-list outline
     __Esc f6__  - hide the item-list outline

  > __%fhook-tcl-exec__ - The command to execute the current Tcl file, default on Unix systems
            is set to _"tclsh %f"_ where _%f_ represents the file name of 
            the current script
            
  > __%fhook-tcl-format__ - The command to format current Tcl file, default  
            is set to _"tclfmt --in-place %f"_  where _%f_ represents the file name.
            The _tclfmt_ program can be installed using the _pip3_ package manager like this:
            _`pip3 install tclint --user`_
            
  > __%fhook-tcl-lint__ - The command to check/lint the current Tcl file, 
            default is set to _"tclint %f"_ where _%f_ represents the file name.
            The _tclint_ program can be installed using the _pip3_ package manager like this:
            _`pip3 install tclint --user`_
  
  > The setting assume that the _tclsh_, the _tclint_ and the _tclfmt_ programs are available via the
    PATH environment variable. On Windows you must insert here either the complete PATH to the 
    executables or add the folder where this file is to the PATH variable.

  > These global variables should be changed if necessary usually within your _USERNAME.emf_ 
    or the _mytcl.emf_ file.

  man - UNIX Manual page


## FILES


  __hkman.emf__ - UNIX manual page hook definition


## EXTENSIONS


  __.man__ - UNIX manual page file


## DESCRIPTION


  The __man__ provides the hilighting of UNIX manual pages, generally acquired
  through the [man(3)](man(3)) command, via a pipe. _man_ references within the
  displayed manual page may be accessed using the mouse in a hypertext
  fashion.

  __Hilighting__
  
  >  The hilighting commands recognize the manual page _bold_ and _underline_
     character sequences and transpose these into the appropriate character
     hilighting. The hilighting sequences are generally unpleasant because
     they also remove the characters for display.

  >  The multitude of different platforms causes problems as different
     vendors produce different character sequences for _bold_/_italic_ text,
     hence on some platforms it may be necessary to add additional
     hilighting rules to cater for any local variations.

  __Short Cuts__
  
  >  Selecting a link node within the manual page using the mouse (i.e. a
     reference to another manual page) then MicroEmacs 2009 attempts to
     find the manual page in the text and invokes [man(3)](man(3)) to render the
     page. This provides a crude hyper text mechanism simply using the
     manual page information itself.
   
  >  The [man-clean(3)](man-clean(3)) command can be used to remove all of the
     hilighting characters from the current manual page. This is the
     typical method of reducing a manual page to plain text.

## DESCRIPTION


  The __perl__ file type template provides the hilighting, indentation and tools
  definitions for a perl file.

  File recognition is performed using the standard file extension __.pl__, __.pm__
  or by the magic string.

  __General Editing__
  
  >  On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
     the file. [time(2m)](time(2m)) is by default enabled, allowing the modification
     time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

     buffer, respectively.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within perl files. The folds occur about
     _sub_...__}__ located on the left-hand margin. [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)) (un)folds all
     regions in the file, [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) (un)folds the current region.

  __Navigation via Item List__

  >  The MicroEmacs macro mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying
     an outline of the subroutines of the Perl file for easy 
     navigation using the [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command.

  __Abbreviations__

  >  The  installation  comes with a default  abbreviation  file for Perl file editing
     which  can  be  used  by  writing  short   abbreviations like   "_wh_" (while), 
     "_if_" (if), or "_sub_" (subroutine) - and then pressing  the key-binding for the  
     [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3)) command.  
     The  list  of  abbreviations  can be used  interactively  in the GUI version of
     MicroEmacs using the [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) command.

  __Tags__
  
  >  A C-tags file may be generated within the editor using the __Tools__ ->
     __Perl-Tools__ -> __Generate Tag File__. [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2)) takes the user to the file
     using the tag information.

  __Short Cuts__
  
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __C-c C-c__ - Comment out the current line.  
     __C-c C-d__ - Uncomment the current line.  
     __C-c esc esc __- Command complete.  
     __A-C-i__ - Restyle the current region.  
     __f2__ - (un)fold the current region  
     __f3__ - (un)fold all regions  
     __f6__ - List items.  
     __esc f6__ - Close list items window.  

  __Debugging__
  
  >  Debugging a perl script can be done inside MicroEmacs by using the
     [perldb(3)](perldb(3)) command.

  __Executing, Formatting and Linting__
  
  > __%fhook-perl-exec__ - The command to execute the current Perl file, default on Unix systems
      is set to _"perl %f"_ where _%f_ represents the file name of the current script.
            
  > __%fhook-perl-format__ - The command to format current Perl file, default is set to 
     _"perltidy -b %f"_  where _%f_ represents the file name.  The _perltidy_ program can 
     be installed usually using the standard package manager or using the cpan utility of Perl.
            
  > __%fhook-perl-lint__ - The command to check/lint the current Perl file, default is set to 
     _"perl -Mstrict -cw %f"_ where _%f_ represents the file name.
     If the program _perlcritic_ is available it is used instead using the following command line:
    _`perlcritic --nocolor --verbose \"%%f:%%l:%%c: %%m\\n\" %f`_
  
  > The setting assume that the _perl_, the _perltidy_ and the _perlcritic_ programs are available
    via the PATH environment variable. On Windows you must insert here either the complete PATH
    to the executables or add the folder where this file is to the PATH variable.

  > These global variables should be changed if necessary usually within your _USERNAME.emf_ 
    or the _myperl.emf_ file. 

## BUGS


  The flexibility of the perl language does cause some hilighting anomalies
  from time to time, typically with unbalanced quote characters. Most of the
  common exceptions have been caught, however there are a few syntax
  sequences that involve quotation marks that can cause problems.

  __<html>__
  
  >  MicroEmacs 2009 recognizes the magic string on any of the first 4
     lines of the file. The HTML files may be extension-less and are still
     recognized.


## DESCRIPTION


  The __html__ file type template provides simple hilighting of HTML files.
  Additionally, MicroEmacs 2009 is capable of rendering simple HTML files
  (without graphic content) into the current buffer and follow the hyper
  text links. The JASSPA HTML documentation may be viewed in this way.

  __General Editing__
  
  >  HTML files may be edited or processed and rendered into the buffer.
     The __Use Author Mode__ option in the [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)) dialog determines
     the edit mode on loading a HTML file; when set to '`N`' the page is
     rendered, '`Y`' and the raw HTML file is presented. The default state is
     '`Y`'.

  __Hilighting__
  
  >  The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
     preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
     language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

  __Navigation via Item List__

  >  The MicroEmacs macro mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying
     an outline of the headers of the HTML file for easy 
     navigation using the [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command.

  __Abbreviations__

  >  The  installation  comes with a default  abbreviation  file for HTML file editing
     which  can  be  used  by  writing  short   abbreviations for tags and attributes.
     The  list  of  abbreviations  can be used  interactively  in the GUI version of
     MicroEmacs using the [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) command.

  __Short Cuts__
  
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __C-c C-h__ - Help information.  
     __C-c C-a__ - Toggle the HTML author status.  
     __html-spell-check-word__ - spell check the current word.  
     __f6__ - List items.  
     __esc f6__ - Close list items window.  

  __Rendered Mode__
  
  >  In the non-author mode, the HTML file is extracted and rendered to the
     buffer. The hypertext links may be followed by selecting them with the
     mouse or using the `<RETURN>` key.

  >  The rendered mode is typically used to check HTML text after it has
     been authored from the editor. The rendered mode only caters for
     regular HTML 2.0 text. It does not handle tables or frames etc. (use a
     browser).

  >  Toggling between rendered and authoring mode, then the buffer should
     be killed as the translation is only performed when the file is read.

  >  The non-author mode can be permanently enabled by setting the Use
     Author Mode option in the [buffer-setup(3)](buffer-setup(3)) dialog to '`N`'. When set to N
     any HTML files loaded are automatically processed, and rendered
     according to their HTML content.


## NOTES


  The [print](print-buffer(2)) driver may be used to generate HTML from the contents of the
  buffer. Select the printer destination as _buffer_, and _HTML_ as the driver.
  The buffer being printed is converted to HTML and dumped in the print
  buffer.

  __.hts__ and __.htp__ are computer generated extended HTML files used in the
  MicroEmacs 2009 documentation system.

  None reported.

## DESCRIPTION


  The __nroff__ file type templates handle UNIX n/troff type files.

  __General Editing__
  
  >  On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
     the file. [time(2m)](time(2m)) is by default enabled, allowing the modification
     time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

  __Hilighting__
  
  >  The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
     preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
     language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

  __Tags__
  
  >  A C-tags file may be generated within the editor using the __Tools__ ->
     __Nroff-Tools__ -> __Create Tag File__. [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2)) takes the user to the file
     using the tag information. The tags are generated using the __.XI__
     keyword, this may not be standard for all nroff pages.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the C and C++ files. The folds occur
     about sections __.S__[__HS__]...__.S__[__HS__] located on the left-hand margin.
     [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)) (un)folds all regions in the file, [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3))
     (un)folds the current region. Note that folding does not operate on
     K&R style code.

  __Tools__
  
  >  The nroff buffer provides a facility to toggle the hilighting of the
     buffer on and off. If font change inserts are used (__\fB__, __\fR__, etc),
     then the enclosed __bold__ and _italic_ regions are hilighted, hiding the
     escape sequences. This allows the nroff text to be viewed in a more
     representative rendered format.

  >  The local buffer command __aman__ invokes, the following command sequence
     (defined in `hkman`) to render a nroff __man__ file into a buffer window;-

             soelim <file> | tbl -TX | neqn | nroff -man | col -x


  >  The command __tex2nr__ attempts to convert a [latex(9)](latex(9)) file into an nroff
     file. The _latex_ escape sequences are converted into their nroff
     equivalents. The command is only made available when an Nroff file is
     loaded (as the command is defined in the `hknroff.emf` file).

  __Short Cuts__
  
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __C-c C-s__ - Insert a font size escape character __\S0__.  
     __C-c C-r__ - Insert a roman font escape character __\fR__.  
     __C-c C-b__ - Insert a bold font escape character __\fB__.  
     __C-c C-i__ - Insert a italic font escape character __\fI__.  
     __C-c C-c__ - Insert a courier font escape character __\fC__.  
     __C-c C-p__ - Insert a previous font escape character __\fP__.  
     __esc o__, __esc q__ - [fill-paragraph(2)](fill-paragraph(2)) fills paragraph to next `.XX` command.  
     __C-c b__ - Bold region by inserting __\fB__ .. __\fR__.  
     __C-c c__ - Courier region by inserting __\fC__ .. __\fR__.  
     __C-c c__ - Italic region by inserting __\fI__ .. __\fR__.  
     __C-c C-h__ - Toggle hilighting on/off.  
     __C-c C-&__ - Adds nroff padding __\f&__ about words.  
     __C-x C-&__ - Removes nroff padding __\f&__ about words.  
     __esc h__ - Nroff help.  

     __f2__ - (un)fold the current region  
     __f3__ - (un)fold all regions  


## BUGS


  The nroff language template is heavily biased towards the __man__ macros only
  and includes all of the extension macros used for generating the JASSPA
  hypertext documentation.

  The template in the current form has been used entirely by JASSPA in
  generating all of the documentation (__HTML__, __Winhelp__, __ehf__, __PostScript__) used
  by MicroEmacs 2009. It does not include all of the troff/nroff keywords,
  or keywords for any of the standard macro packages.

  The JASSPA documentation preparation tools are proprietary and have not
  been made publicly available.

  `$INFOPATH`/dir. The default search paths on different platforms are:-

       `c:/info` - MS-DOS and MS-Windows (all).
       `/usr/local/info` - All UNIX platforms.


## DESCRIPTION


  The GNU _info_ files are handled by the command [info(3)](info(3)) which starts the
  info reader. This reads the initial info file `dir` and initializes the _info_
  file traversal. Where the _info_ directory is not in the aforementioned
  locations then the `$INFOPATH` environment variable should specify the base
  directory.

  The standard _info_ navigation keys are in effect within the _info_ buffers.
  The _mouse_ may also be used to select the next info page.


## BUGS


  There is no support within MicroEmacs 2009 to regenerate the _info_ tags and
  indexes.

## DESCRIPTION


  The standard assembler file extensions __.s__ and __.asm__ are by default not
  bound to any hook functions as they are platform specific. The user should
  define a default binding for the assembler file types as appropriate to
  the current platform and assembler development. i.e. for the Windows
  environment the [x86(9)](x86(9)) file type would be conditionally bound to the file
  e.g.

```{.emf}

     extension-less and are still recognized.


## DESCRIPTION


  The __python__ file type template provides simple hilighting of Python files,
  the template provides minimal hilighting.

  File recognition is performed using the standard file extension __.py__, or by
  the magic string.

  The Python file hook offers as well folding and support for displaying an outline
  of the functions and classes of the Python script for easy navigation using the 
  [item-list(3)](item-list(3))  command and expanding abbreviations either via short strings using
  the [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3)) command and visually  inserting abbreviations using the
  [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) macro.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the Python files. The folds occur about the
     __def__ or  __class__  keywords  located on the   left-hand  margin.  The following
     commands are supported to show and hide  the function bodies. 
     
  >  [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3))     -  (un)folds all regions in the file,  
     [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) - (un)folds the current region.

  __List Items__

  >  Item listing is available and the key constructs of the file may be listed
     using  the [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command.

  __Abreviations__

  >  The installation comes with a default abbreviation file for Python editing
     which can be used by writing short abbreviations like "_for_", "_if_" or "_def_" - 
     for Python functions. More extended abbreviations are "_main_" for an Python
     application outline or "_class_" for a Python class template. The short strings
     are then replaced by pressing the key-binding for the [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3))
     command. The list of abbreviations can be used as well interactively in the GUI
     version of MicroEmacs using the  [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) command.

  __Short Cuts__
        
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __C-c C-c__ - Comment out the current line.  
     __C-c C-d__ - Uncomment the current line.  
     __C-c C-e__ - Comment to the end of the line with stars (*).  
     __A-C-i__   - Restyle the current region.  
     __esc q__   - Format a comment.  
     __esc o__   - Format a comment.  
     __f2__      - (un)fold the current region  
     __f3__      - (un)fold all regions
     __f6__      - show the item-list outline
     __Esc f6__  - hide the item-list outline

  __Executing, Formatting and Linting__
  
  > __%fhook-python-exec__ - The command to execute the current Python file, default on Unix systems
      is set to _"python3 %f"_ where _%f_ represents the file name of the current script.
            
  > __%fhook-python-format__ - The command to format current Python file, default is set to
     _"ruff format %f"_  or _"yapf -i %f"_ or _"black -q %f"_ if one of these tools is available, 
     where again _%f_ represents the file name.
     If you have installed them as Python packages, you should this variable to _"python -m ruff"_
     for instance.
            
  > __%fhook-python-lint__ - The command to check/lint the current Python file, default is set to 
     _"ruff check %f"_  or _"pylint %f"_ if one of these tools is available _%f_ represents the file name.
     If you have installed them as Python packages, you should this variable to _"python -m pylint"_
     for instance.
  
  > The setting assume that the _python3_, the _ruff_ or the _yapf_ programs are available
    via the _PATH_ environment variable. On Windows you must insert here either the complete
    file path to the executables or add the folder where this file is to the _PATH_ variable.

  > These global variables should be changed if necessary usually within your _USERNAME.emf_ 
    or the _mypython.emf_ file. Here an example to use ruff as Python package based on a local
    install of Python into a virtual environment.
    
```{.emf}
        set-variable %fhook-python-exec "/home/username/venv/bin/python3 %f"
        set-variable %fhook-python-lint "/home/username/venv/bin/python3 -m ruff check %f"
        set-variable %fhook-python-format "/home/username/venv/bin/python3 -m ruff format %f"
```

## BUGS


  There would appear to be too much applied hilighting in this file, it
  could probably do with rationalizing.

## DESCRIPTION


  The __ruby__ file type template provides simple highlighting of Ruby files.

  __General Editing__
  
  >  On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
     the file. [time(2m)](time(2m)) is by default enabled, allowing the modification
     time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

  __Highlighting__
  
  >  The highlighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
     preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
     language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled, the folds occur about __module__ and __class__
     definitions located on the left-hand margin. [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)) (un)folds
     all regions in the file, [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) (un)folds the current
     region.

  __List Items__
  
  >  Item listing is available and the key constructs of the file may be
     listed in the _item-list_.

  __Indentation__
  
  >  Automatic indentation is provided, including a buffer re-style.

  __Short Cuts__
  
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __esc h__ - Key binding help information.  
     __C-c C-c__ - Comment out the current line.  
     __C-c C-d__ - Uncomment the current line.  
     __C-c C-e__ - Comment to the end of the line with hash (#).  
     __C-c C-o__ - Format a comment  
     __f2__ - (un)fold the current region  
     __f3__ - (un)fold all regions  
     __f6__ - List items.  
     __esc f6__ - Close list items window.


## BUGS


  In line redirection (i.e. `<< EOL`) can cause rendering and indent
  anomalies.

  The block documentation remains under indent control, this should be
  disabled.

  __Abreviations__

  >  The installation comes with a default abbreviation file for Ada file editing
     which can be used by writing short abbreviations like "_fo_" (for), "_if_" or "_wh_" (while) - 
     for Ada code. The list of abbreviations can be used as well interactively in the GUI
     version of MicroEmacs using the  [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) command.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled, the folds occur about __module__ and __class__
     definitions located on the left-hand margin. [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)) (un)folds
     all regions in the file, [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) (un)folds the current
     region.

  __Navigation via Item Lists__
  
  >  Item listing is available and the key constructs of the file such as
     procedures, functions and types may be listed in the _item-list_.

  __Working Environment__
  
  >  [compile(3)](compile(3)) may be invoked to rebuild the source, the user is prompted
     to save any files.

  __Short Cuts__
  
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __esc h__ - Key binding help information.  
     __C-c C-c__ - Comment out the current line.  
     __C-c C-d__ - Uncomment the current line.  
     __C-c C-e__ - Comment to the end of the line with hash (#).  
     __C-c C-o__ - Format a comment
     __f2__ - (un)fold the current region  
     __f3__ - (un)fold all regions  
     __f6__ - List items.  
     __esc f6__ - Close list items window.

  __Executing, Formatting and Linting__
  
  > __%fhook-ada-exec__ - The command to execute the current Ada file, default
       is set to _"gnatmake %f && ./%b" _ where %f represents the file name, on
       Windows the slash for the execution is replaced with a back-slash
  > __%fhook-ada-format__ - The command to format current Ada file, default  
       is set to _"gnatpp %f"_ where %f represents the file name  
  > __%fhook-ada-lint__ - The command to check/lint the current Ada file, 
       default is set to _"gcc -c -x ada -fsyntax-only  -gnats -gnatef %f"_ 
  
  > The setting assume that the _Ada_ compiler is available via the _PATH_
    environment variable. On Windows you must insert here either the complete 
    _PATH_ to the  _`gnatmake`_ and _`gcc`_ executable or add the folder where this file is to the
    _PATH_ variable.

  > These global variables should be changed if necessary usually within your _USERNAME.emf_ 
    or the _myada.emf_ file. 

## NOTES


  The highlighting and item listing is typically extended using a file __myada.emf__.

! 9 jst
## SYNOPSIS


  jst - JASSPA Structured Text


## FILES


  __hkjst.emf__ - Jasspa structured text file hook definition.


## DESCRIPTION


  JASSPA Structured Text (__jst__) is an ASCII text format which includes some
  reserved text constructs that allow quite complex word processor type
  documents to be constructed with the minimal amount of additional
  annotation and which remains readable in its raw ASCII form. The
  motivation for doing this is to quickly construct documents and notes for
  publication whilst editing within MicroEmacs.

  __JST__ is a richer mark-up than the simpler [doc(9)](doc(9)) file type.

  The main requirements of JST are:

  - Easy to remember.
  - Easily readable and can be highlighted well in MicroEmacs.
  - Well defined, i.e. not ambiguous so formating errors can be
        generated.
  - Extendable.
  - May be automatically reformatted.
  - Handle things like figure references and internal anchor and
        references.
  - Html and LaTeX output, possibly rtf and text.

  The syntax definition used by JST is defined in the next section.

  The JST template extensions include a number of converters that will
  syntax check the text and then format and export the text to a new
  presentation format that may be imported into a word processor or used
  directly in the generated form.


## BASIC SYNTAX


  The syntax of JST reserves basic character sequences which may be
  unambiguously interpreted into document styling. The basic syntax set
  allows a simple formatted document to be produced with the minimal amount
  of work from the author.

  JST supports more advanced extensions which allow tables and hypertext
  tags to be defined, these are discussed in the __Advanced__ __Syntax__ section
  later.


## Quoting 


  To ensure that all characters may be input as typed then there is no
  single escape character. The character sequence __&[___<char>___]__ may be used to
  escape a character _<char>_. Our experience is that escaping is not usually
  necessary.


## Basic Styling 


  The basic character styling is performed with a pair of escape characters
  at the start and end of a string sequence. The style end token does not
  have to appear on the same line as the start token and an error is
  reported if the sequence is not closed properly. Composite styles may be
  built buy combining the different tokens by inclusion of a new style
  within another style block. Where styles are nested then they should be
  closed in the reverse order that they were opened.

  `""Raw Text""`
  
  >  A pair of double quotes surrounding a text block is treated as
     verbatim and is not subject to escaping, that is the character format
     characters are not translated.

  __**Bold Text**__
  
  >  A pair of star characters denote a emboldened text region.

  _//Italic Text//_
  
  >  A forward slash pair denotes an italic text region.

  __`__Underline Text__`__
 
  >   A underscore pair denotes an underlined region.

  `@@Mono Text@@`
  
  >  A pair of at symbols denotes a fixed text region rendered in a fixed
     width font.

  ``Superscript Text``
  
  >  A pair of grave accents denotes superscript text region.

  ,,Subscript Text,,
  
  >  A pair of commas denotes a subscript text region.

  Styles may be nested i.e. `//Italic **Bold Italic** Italic Again//` To get
  raw text with a double quote use: `""raw with a &["]" in it""`


## Styling Paragraphs and Blocks 


  Blocks of text may be demarked by a single token at the start of the line.
  A exclamation mark '`!`' at the start of a paragraph may be followed by one
  or more style letters to enable the style for the paragraph, for
  consistency with the in-line tokens then double characters may be used.

      !* As an example this baragraph is bold as it started with a '!*'.


  produces

  >   __As an example this baragraph is bold as it started with a '!*'.__

  The exclamation mark may be followed by multiple different styles which
  are applied together. e.g.

      !"@ This paragraph  started with '!"@' so it is quoted and mono-spaced
      style, i.e. @@, "" or ** is ignored.


  You can enable a style over a block of text by using a '`!`' style
  definition with no further text to the right. The block is terminated by a
  '`!end!`' or '`>end>`' tag on its own line. It is recommended that you insert
  a blank line before and after the '`!end!`' definition so that it does not
  affect the filling of the following paragraph.

      !end!


  Paragraphs may be associated with a literal block of text from a different
  programming language. These are introduced with a '`>type>`' tag and end
  with a '`>end>`' tag. The tag types that are currently supported include:

      `emf   ` - JASSPA MicroEmacs Macro file.
      `pseudo` - Pseudo code block.
      `bnf   ` - BNF block.
      `c     ` - ANSI C code block.
      `cpp   ` - C++ code block.
      `perl  ` - Perl code block.
      `tcl   ` - TCL code block.
      `shell ` - UNIX shell block.
      `java  ` - Java code block.
      `ini   ` - MS-DOS/Windows .ini code block
      `php   ` - PHP code block.
      `make  ` - Makefile fragment.

  The aforementioned blocks support syntax language highlighting and
  indentation. As an example:

             Some example 'C' code:
             >c>
             /* This is C code */
             int main (int argc, char *argv[])
             {
                 printf ("Hello World\n");
                 return 0;
             }
             >end>


## Justification of Paragraphs and Blocks 


  A paragraph is a block of text delimited by an empty line, by default all
  paragraphs are left justified. Where the layout of the paragraph is
  literal and should not be re-formatted then the paragraph should be
  proceeded by a '`>`' symbol e.g.

       > This paragraph will not be reformatted
       because it starts with a '>', the
       output will respect the position of the new lines.


  Paragraphs may be center justified with a leading '`>c`' e.g.

       >c This is centered text


  With centered text then the indentation of the '`>c`' centers the text from
  the indent position. e.g.

                 >c Note the initial indent level is important
                 as the text is
                 centered w.r.t. the remainder.
 

  Text may be right justified with a leading '`>r`'.


## Indentation 


  Indentation is implicitly defined by the indentation of the first line of
  the paragraph, each paragraph is effectively independent with respect to
  determining the indentation level.

  The indentation level is defined to be the the column of the first
  non-white-space character of the first line divided by the _Indent_ _Width_
  (see indent-setup) rounded up. For example this the first non-white of
  this paragraph is the 'F' at column 4, with an indent width of 4 (the
  default) this is a an indent level of 1.

  A line starting with 6 spaces so it has an indent level of 2 (6/4 == 1.5
  which is rounded up to 2). Rounding up allows item lists to work with
  little effort, without introducing ambiguity, for example.

  The indentation of a code fragment or literal text block are determined by
  the indentation of the initial style tag, for example:

             >"@"
             >c>
             int myVariable ;
             >end>
      >end>


  The code block is indented from the left paragraph by the starting block
  indent.


## Headings 


  Headings may be defined and commence with a equals ('`=`') character as the
  first character of the line. The number of equals determines the heading
  level.

      = Top Level Heading
      == Sub-heading
      === Sub-sub-heading


  The position of the heading may be controlled and may be left, centered or
  right justified using `l`, `c` or `r` respectively. Left justified is the
  default when not defined.

      =c Centered Top Level Heading
      ==r Right justified sub-heading


## Item Lists 


  Items lists are bullet or number lists of items which are introduced by a
  _formatChar___.__ to start the list, subsequent list items are introduced with a
  period '__.__' character only or optionally with the bullet character. Where
  _formatChar_ identifies the type of list as follows:

      `*`  - bullet list.
      `1`  - Numeric item list.
      `a`  - Lowercase alphabetic list.
      `A`  - Uppercase alphabetic list.
      `i`  - Roman numeral list.
      `I`  - Upper case Roman numeral list.
      `:.` - Text item list.

  Indentation and sub-paragraphs are supported within the paragraph. e.g.

          1. Start or a numbered list.

             Sub-paragraph of numbered list.

          2. 2nd item in numbered list
 
             *. Contained bullet list.

              . 2nd item of bullet list.

          . 3rd item in numbered list.


  The text item, or definition, requires some further explanation. This
  allows a definition item to be defined (e.g. glossary of terms at start of
  document or note points within a document). These are defined at column 0
  e.g.

      :. MyDefinition

            Description of the term.


## ADVANCED SYNTAX


  This section defiens the advanced syntax extensions of JST which allow
  more complex documents to be generated. These extensions may be used to
  author more complex documents for export.


## Tables 


  Quite complex tables may be supported through JST. A table is introduced
  with the closing square brace '__]__ character at the start of the line which
  define the ghlobal properties and dimensions of the table. Each entry in
  the table is introduced by '__]__ and is followed by the assigned content.

  The initial table definition has the syntax

      ]crh <# columns> <# rows>


  Where '__c__' and '__r__' are optional and center or right justify the table, '__h__'
  hides the table lines i.e. no border. The dimensions of the table then
  follow.

  A simple definition of a 3x2 table might be defined as:

      ] 3 2

      ] Row 1 col 1 content.

      ] Row 1 col 2 content.
 
      ] Row 1 col 3 content.

      ] Row 2 col 1 content.

      ] Row 2 col 2 content.
 
      ] Row 2 col 3 content.


  The content may include

      `*.` Use item lists
      `. ` Like this
      `!c` Center text
      `!r` Right justify text
      _also embedded images, see later._

  Columns and rows may be joined both horizontally and vertically by
  specifying the join in the cell definition. '__]>'__ performs a horizontal
  cell join of two cells, a single '__>__' should be added for each
  additional cell so '__]>>__' joins 3 cells horizontally. A vertical join
  is similarly specified with '__]v__'.

      ] 3 3

      ]>> Single top row with 3 columns joined content.

      ]v 2 rows joined in the first column content.

      ]> 2nd row 2nd and 3rd column joined content.

      ] 3rd row 2nd column content.

      ] 3rd row 3rd column content.


## Special Characters and Symbols 


  Special characters are introduced with '__&[___special___]__' and are defined as
  follows:

  `&[nl]` or `&[new-line]`
  
  >  Newline.

  `&[np]` or `&[new-page]`
  
  >  New page. This is not supported in HTML or text.

  `&[nf]` or `&[new-file]`
  
  >  New file, the effect is dependent on the output format:

  >  __html __
   
  > >   Starts a new html file, typical use of this is when the first file
        contains the TOC with links to the subsequent files.

  >  __latex __
    
  > >   Just starts a new page, i.e. same as [[np]].

  >  __rtf __
   
  > >   Just starts a new page, i.e. same as [[np]].

  >  __text __
   
  > >    Ignored.

  `&[toc]`
  
  >  Inserts an automatically generated table of contents.

  `---`
  
  >  Inserts a horizontal line. This must be the only text on the line.


## Tags and Hyperlinks 


  Most of the more complex formatting is performed with tags. The general
  format of a tag is defined as:

  >  __&[___<tag-id><options> <args>___]__

  If a argument contains a space or a '__]__' then it must be quoted, e.g.:

      &[c this-is-okay]
      &[c "this is okay"]
      &[c "this [\"is\"] okay"]


  A tag may support numerous options, the order of the options is not
  important but the order of their arguments is as specified in the docs,
  not the order given with the tag therefore __&[idw <image> <depth> <width>]__
  is still __&[iwd <image> <depth> <width>]__. The text that actually appears in
  any generated document should not appear in a tag as the spelling check
  should skip the contents of a tag. This means that a link should take the
  HTML form of encasing the text label with start and end tags rather than
  being in the tag itself. One exception would be the setting of a variable.

  __Comment Tag __
  
  >  Inserts a comment.

  >  __&[c__ _<0+args>___]__

  >  There may be any number of arguments, the whole tag is ignored. As the
     comment ends with a ']' and ']' char in the comment must be quoted,
     i.e.:

            &[c this is a comment with a "]" "char[23]" in it]


  __Anchor Tag __
  
  >  Internal document reference.

  >  __&[a__ _<name>___]__

  >   An anchor tag can be placed anywhere and referenced by a link .

  __Foreground and Background Color Tag __
  
  >  Modifies the color of the text foreground and background.

  >  __&[f__ _<color>___]__ .... __&[/f]__

  >  Sets the current foreground color where _<color>_ is either a direct
     HTML format color definition (e.g. "`#ff0000`" for __red__) or a previously
     defined color name.

  >  __&[b__ _<color>___]__ .... __&[/b]__

  >  Sets similarly sets the current background color.

  >  A number of options are supported by the color tag as follows:

  >  __&[fs__ _<name>_ _<color>___]__
   
  > >    Define color '<name>' to be '<color>', the <name> may be
         references in the f/b color references.

  >  __&[fd__ _<color>___]__
   
  > >    Sets the default foreground color to <color>.

  >  __&[bd__ _<color>___]__
   
  > >    Sets the default background color to <color>.

  __Link Tag __
  
  >  Link to another part of the document or URL.

  >  __&[l__ _<url>___]__ .... __&[/l]__

  >  Creates a hyperlink with the text with '`....`' going to the _<url>_, The
     format of the url uses the standard HTML syntax, a link starting with
     a hash '`#`' is assumed to be local and a warning will be issued if the
     corresponding anchor point is not found. An error is generated if the
     __&[/l]__ is missing.

  >  Urls appearing in the text like '`http://www.jasspa.com`' are
     automatically turned into links. To avoid this quote the string, i.e.
     ""http://www.jasspa.com""

  __Image Tag __
  
  >  Insert an image in the document.

  >  __&[i__ _<image-name>___]__

  >  Inserts an image _<image-name>_, for example __&[i me.png]__

  >  Additional options allow the depth and width of the image to be
     specified:

  >  __&[idw__ _<image-name> <depth> <width>___]__

  >  Where option __d__ specifies the depth of image and __w__ specifies the width
     of the image. e.g. `&[iw test.jpg 60]`. The size is given in pixels and
     the conversion variable '_image-ppi_' is used to convert is a physical
     paper size. The width may also be specified as a percentage, e.g. __50%__.

  __Use Tag __
  
  >  Insert a file at the current point.
   
          &[u <file-name>]

  >  Inserts _<file-name>_ into the current location and processes it as if
     part of the original docuement. e.g. `&[u` `insert.jst]` inserts the file
     _insert.jst_ at the current position in the file.

  __Variable Tag __
  
  >  Insert a variable.

  >  __&[v__ _<variable-name>___]__

  >  Inserts the current value of variable _<variable-name>_, variable names
     may only contain alphanumeric characters and '`-`'.

  >  The variable supports a set of simple options that allow the variable
     value to be manipulated prior to insertion e.g. for handling numbers
     etc. The option syntax is defined as follows:

  >  __&[vdinrs__ _<variable-name>_ _<value>_ _<increment>_ _<reference-name>___]__

  >  __d__
            Define the reference <reference-name> for the current value.

  >  __i__
            Pre-increment the variable value by <increment> prior to
            insertion.

  >  __n__
            Do not insert the variable value.

  >  __r__
            Insert the <reference-name> value.

  >  __s __
            Set the value to <value> first.

  >  As an example, consider the following sequence to implement figure
     labels and reference them:

            &[vsn figure 0]

            &[i figure1.jpg]
            Figure &[vid figure 1 figA] - my first figure

            some more text

            &[i figure2.jpg]
            Figure &[vid figure 1 figB] - my second figure

            To see  **figure &[vr figure  figA]** //my first  figure// and **figure
            &[vr figure figB]** //my second figure//.

            To see  **figure &[vr figure  figA]** //my first  figure// and **figure
            &[vr figure figB]** //my second figure//.


  >  An undefined variable has a value of "`ERROR`", it can be defined by
     using either option '__s__' or '__i__' in which case the value is `0`, i.e. the
     following can be used

  >  `= Chapter 1: Will be 1 at the top of the doc`

  >  A set of special variables are automatically defined:

  >  __title __
            The document title.

  >  __author __
            The author

  >  __image-ppi __
            Image pixels per inch resolution setting, this is the resolution
            of the generated document in inches.

  __Output Dump Tag __
  
  >  Dump output text.

  >  __&[o__ _<out-type> <raw-text>___]__

  >  Dumps _<raw-text>_ into the output if the target output type is
     _<out-type>_, where _<out-type>_ can be __all__, __html__, __latex__, __rtf__ and __text__.

  __Dump Tag __
  
  >  Dumps the tag for processing.

  >  __[d__ _<out-type> <text>___]__

  >  This command is similar to Output Dump Tag except this is done first
     so the _<text>_ is processed, this can be used to define output specific
     formatting, e.g. (note that the \ at the end of the line is used here
     to show that the content should be placed on a single line).

            &[d html "&[vsn large-font-start \"..html def..\"] \
                      &[vsn large-font-end \"..html def..\"]"]
            &[d latex "&[vsn large-font-start \"..latex def..\"] \
                       &[vsn large-font-end \"..latex def..\"]"]
            &[d text "&[vsn large-font-start \"\"]&[vsn large-font-end \"\"]"]


  >  so in the main body of the text:

            &[v large-font-start] Large Text &[v large-font-end]


  >  This is a complex concept and is beyond most users requirements, but
     making this kind of thing possible means that users should be able to
     do whatever they need to.


## TEMPLATE


  The template supports highlighting and indention including commands for
  exporting JST to another format:

  __jst-to-htm __
  
  >  Export the JST definition to an HTML file with __.htm__ extension.

  __jst-to-html __
  
  >  Export the JST definition to an HTML file with __.htm__ extension.

  __jst-to-rtf __
  
  >  Export the JST definition to an RTF file, for this export then the
     file name is __.rtf__ but the content is HTML. __Word(1)__ and __StarOffice(1)__
     know how to convert this when imported.

  __jst-to-latex __
  
  >  Convert to a LaTeX file format.


## FILES


  JST is controlled by the macro files `hkjst.emf` which contains the basic
  template. `jstutl.emf` includes the utilities used for conversion to other
  formats.


## INTERNAL FORMAT


  __JST__ uses an internal neutral format which is used in the conversion
  process, this allows different back end output format drivers to be
  written against the neutral format without dealing with the input syntax.
  This intermediate format is not visible to the user and does not exist in
  the output. The internal format is defined as follows:

  __\bF?__....__\bf?__
  
  >  Font style change where __?__ is __B__,__I__,__U__,__M__,__p__,__b__).

  __\bDD\bDF___<color>___\bDB___<color>___\bdD__....__\bDd__
  
  >  Foreground or background color change where _<color>_ = hexadecimal
     value `RRGGBB`. Note that __\bDF___<c>_ or __\bDB___<c>_ may be be omitted.

  __\bIT___<image-name>___\biT__
  
  >  Insert an image without scaling.

  __\bIT___<image-name>___\bID___<depth>___\biD\bIW___<width>___\biW\biT__
  
  >  Insert an image with scaling.

  __\bTA___<anchor-name>___\btA__

  >  A variable name (temporary).

  __\bSF__
  
  >  Start new file.

  __\bSL__
  
  >  Start new line.

  __\bSP__
  
  >  Start new page.

  __\bSN__
  
  >  No-text symbol.

  __\bST__
  
  >  Insert the table of content (temporary)

  __\bPI__
  
  >  Indent level.

  __\bPT__
  
  >  Indent tab level (used only in generated TOC).

  __\bPB__....__\bpB__
  
  >  Paragraph - justification both.

  __\bPC__....__\bpC__
  
  >  Paragraph - justification center.

  __\bPF__....__\bpF__

## SYNOPSIS


  r - R Language File.


## FILES


  __hkr.emf__ - R language file hook definition  
  __r.etf__   - R template file  
  __r.eaf__   - R abbreviation file

## EXTENSIONS

## MAGIC STRINGS


  __^#![ \t]*/.*env[ \t]+Rscript__
  
  >  MicroEmacs 2009 recognizes the magic string on the first line of the
     file used to locate the executable. The R files may be
     extension-less and are still recognized.


## DESCRIPTION


  The __R__ file type template provides simple hilighting of R files,
  the template provides minimal hilighting.

  File recognition is performed using the standard file extension __.r__, or __.R__ or by
  the magic string.

  The R file hook offers as well folding and support for displaying an outline
  of the functions of the R script for easy navigation using the [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command
  and expanding abbreviations either via short strings using the 
  [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3)) command and visually inserting abbreviations
  using the [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) macro.

  __Abbreviations__

  >  The installation comes with a default abbreviation file for R editing
     which can be used by writing short abbreviations like "_for_", "_if_" or "_func_" - 
     for R functions. More extended abbreviations are "_main_" for an Rscript
     application outline or "_openr_" and "_openw_" for reading and writing text files.
     The short strings  are then replaced by pressing the key-binding for the 
     [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3))  command.
     The list of abbreviations can be used as well interactively in the GUI version 
     of MicroEmacs using the  [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) command.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the R files. The folds occur about the
     function definitions  located on the   left-hand  margin using the smaller-minus
     assignment operator. 
     The following  commands are supported to show and hide  the function bodies. 
     
  >  [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3))     - (un)folds all regions in the file,  
     [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) - (un)folds the current region.

  __Navigation via Item List__

  >  The R mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying an outline
     of the functions and classes of the R file for easy navigation using the 
     [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command.

  __Short Cuts__
        
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __C-c C-c__ - Comment out the current line.  
     __C-c C-d__ - Uncomment the current line.  
     __C-c C-e__ - Comment to the end of the line with stars (*).  
     __A-C-i__   - Restyle the current region.  
     __esc q__   - Format a comment.  
     __esc o__   - Format a comment.  
     __f2__      - (un)fold the current region  
     __f3__      - (un)fold all regions
     __f6__      - show the item-list outline
     __Esc f6__  - hide the item-list outline

## BUGS


  There would appear to be too much applied highlighting in this file, it
  could probably do with rationalizing.

## DESCRIPTION


  The __go__ file type templates share much with the [c(9)](c(9)) template
  definitions, utilising the electric 'C' features for automatic layout of
  text.

  __General Editing__
  
  >  On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
     the file. [time(2m)](time(2m)) is by default enabled, allowing the modification
     time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

  __Hilighting__
  
  >  The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
     preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
     language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

  __Auto Layout__
  
  >  The C-Mode [indent(2)](indent(2)) performs automatic layout of the text.

  >  [restyle-region(3)](restyle-region(3)) and [restyle-buffer(3)](restyle-buffer(3)) are available to reformat
     (re-layout) selected sections of the buffer, or the whole buffer,
     respectively.

  >  Comments may be formatted using `esc o`, which reformats the comments
     according to the current fill paragraph. If a comment commences with
     `/***...` then the comment is automatically formatted to a box.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the Go files. The folds occur
     about the __func__ keyword and a closing curly brace, both at the
     beginning of a line. 

  > - [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)) (un)folds all regions in the file, 
    - [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) (un)folds the current region. 

  __Navigation via Item List__

  >  The Go mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying an outline
     of the functions and classes of the Go file for easy navigation using the 
     [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command.

  __Abbreviations__

     "_if_", "_elif_" or "_type_" - and then pressing the key-binding for the 
     [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3)) command.  
     The  list  of  abbreviations  can be used  interactively  in the GUI version of
     MicroEmacs using the [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) command.

  __Working Environment__
  
  >  [compile(3)](compile(3)) may be invoked to rebuild the source, the user is prompted
     to save any files.

  __Short Cuts__
  
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __C-c C-c__ - Comment out the current line.  
     __C-c C-d__ - Uncomment the current line.  
     __C-c C-e__ - Comment to the end of the line with stars (*).  
     __A-C-i__ - Restyle the current region.  
     __esc q__ - Format a comment.  
     __esc o__ - Format a comment.  
     __f2__ - (Un)fold the current region.  
     __f3__ - (Un)fold all regions.  
     __f6__ - Display the item list.
     __esc f6__ - Hide the item list.

  __Executing, Formatting and Linting__
  
  > __%fhook-go-exec__ - The command to execute the current Go file, default
       is set to _"go run %f"_ where %f represents the file name  
  > __%fhook-go-format__ - The command to format current Go file, default  
       is set to _"go fmt -w %f"_ where %f represents the file name  
  > __%fhook-go-lint__ - The command to check/lint the current Go file, 
       default is set to _"go vet %f"_ 
  
  > The setting assume that the _Go_ compiler is available via the _PATH_
    environment variable. On Windows you must insert here either the complete 
    _PATH_ to the  _`go`_ executable or add the folder where this file is to the
    _PATH_ variable.

  > These global variables should be changed if necessary usually within your _USERNAME.emf_ 
    or the _mygo.emf_ file. 

## NOTES


  The hilighting is typically extended using a file __mygo.emf__

    or the _mydart.emf_ file. 
  
## NOTES


  The hilighting is typically extended using a file __mydart.emf__ located
  within the users configuration folder, usually _~/.jasspa_.

## SYNOPSIS


  c3 - C3 programming language templates
  __%fhook-c3-exec__  
  __%fhook-c3-format__  
  __%fhook-c3-lint__  


## FILES


  __hkc3.emf__ - C3 programming language hook definition  
  __c3.etf__ - C3 programming language template file  
  __c3.eaf__ - C3 programming language abbreviation file


## EXTENSIONS


  __.c3__ - C3


## DESCRIPTION


  The __c3__ file type templates share much with the [c(9)](c(9)) template
  definitions, utilising the electric 'C' features for automatic layout of
  text.

  __General Editing__
  
  >  On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
     the file. [time(2m)](time(2m)) is by default enabled, allowing the modification
     time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

  __Hilighting__
  
  >  The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
     preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
     language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

  __Auto Layout__
  
  >  The C-Mode [indent(2)](indent(2)) performs automatic layout of the text.

  >  [restyle-region(3)](restyle-region(3)) and [restyle-buffer(3)](restyle-buffer(3)) are available to reformat
     (re-layout) selected sections of the buffer, or the whole buffer,
     respectively.

  >  Comments may be formatted using `esc o`, which reformats the comments
     according to the current fill paragraph. If a comment commences with
     `/***...` then the comment is automatically formatted to a box.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the Go files. The folds occur
     about the __fn__ keyword and a closing curly brace, both at the
     beginning of a line. 
     
  > - [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)) (un)folds all regions in the file, 
  > - [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) (un)folds the current region. 

  __Navigation via Item List__

  >  The C3 mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying an outline
     of the functions and classes of the C3 file for easy navigation using the 
     [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command.

  __Abbreviations__

  >  The  installation  comes with a default  abbreviation  file for C3 file
     editing which  can  be  used  by  writing  short   abbreviations like
     "_for_", "_if_", "_elif_" or "_class_" - and then pressing the key-binding
     for the [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3)) command.  
     The  list  of  abbreviations  can be used  interactively  in the GUI version of
     MicroEmacs using the [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) command.

  __Working Environment__
  
  >  [compile(3)](compile(3)) may be invoked to rebuild the source, the user is prompted
     to save any files.

  __Short Cuts__
  
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __C-c C-c__ - Comment out the current line.  
     __C-c C-d__ - Uncomment the current line.  
     __C-c C-e__ - Comment to the end of the line with stars (*).  
     __A-C-i__ - Restyle the current region.  
     __esc q__ - Format a comment.  
     __esc o__ - Format a comment.  
     __f2__ - (Un)fold the current region.  
     __f3__ - (Un)fold all regions.  
     __f6__ - Display the item list.
     __esc f6__ - Hide the item list.

  __Executing, Formatting and Linting__
  
  > __%fhook-c3-exec__ - The command to execute the current C3 file, default
       is set to _"c3c compile-run %f --"_ where %f represents the file name.
  > __%fhook-c3-format__ - The command to format current C3 file, default  
       is set to _"astyle --indent-spaces=2 %f"_ if _astyle_ is installed.
  > __%fhook-c3-lint__ - The command to check/lint the current C3 file, 
       default is set to _"c3c compile %f -o %b"_ 
  
  > The setting assume that the _c3c_ compiler is available via the _PATH_
    environment variable. On Windows you must insert here either the complete _PATH_ to the 
    _c3c_ executable or add the folder where this file is in to the _PATH_ variable.


  > These global variables should be changed if necessary usually within your _USERNAME.emf_ 
    or the _myc3.emf_ file. 

## NOTES


  The hilighting is typically extended using a file __myc3.emf__. Executing, linting and
  formatting of C3 files can be achieved by setting the variables:
  
```{.emf}
     set-variable %fhook-c3-format "astyle --indent=spaces=2 %f" ; if astyle is available
     set-variable %fhook-c3-lint   "c3c compile %f -o %b"
     set-variable %fhook-c3-exec   "c3c compile-run %f --"
```

  __Navigation via Item List__

  >  The V mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying an outline
     of the functions and classes of the V file for easy navigation using the 
     [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command. 
     Public functions are highlighted with color in the item list.

  __Abbreviations__

  >  The  installation  comes with a default  abbreviation  file for V file
     editing which  can  be  used  by  writing  short   abbreviations like
     "_for_", "_if_", "_elif_", "_str" (public structure)  or "_type_" - and then 
     pressing the key-binding  for the [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3)) command.
     The  list  of  abbreviations  can be used  interactively  in the GUI version of
     MicroEmacs using the [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) command.

  __Executing, Formatting and Linting__
  
  > __%fhook-v-exec__ - The command to execute the current V file, default
       is set to _"v crun %f"_ where %f represents the file name  
  > __%fhook-v-format__ - The command to format current V file, default  
       is set to _"v fmt -w %f"_ where %f represents the file name  
  > __%fhook-v-lint__ - The command to check/lint the current V file, 
       default is set to _"v vet %f"_ 
  
  > The setting assume that the _V_ compiler is available via the _PATH_
    environment variable. On Windows you must insert here either the complete 
    _PATH_ to the  _`v`_ executable or add the folder where this file is to the
    _PATH_ variable.

  > These global variables should be changed if necessary usually within your _USERNAME.emf_ 
    or the _myv.emf_ file. 

## NOTES


  The hilighting is typically extended using a file __myv.emf__. As this language
  shares the same extensions as [Verilog(9)](verilog(9)) files you might be adding the add the 
  following line to your user emf file.
  
     add-file-hook ".v" fhook-v
  
  As an alternative you can add the following first line to your V-files so that
  they are automatically recognized as V language files and not as Verilog files.

## DESCRIPTION


  The __js__ file type templates share much with the [c(9)](c(9)) template definitions,
  utilising the electric 'C' features for automatic layout of text.

  __General Editing__
  
  >  On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
     the file. [time(2m)](time(2m)) is by default enabled, allowing the modification
     time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

  __Hilighting__
  
  >  The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logicals,
     function or class definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
     language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

  __Auto Layout__
  
  >  The C-Mode [indent(2)](indent(2)) performs automatic layout of the text.

  >  [restyle-region(3)](restyle-region(3)) and [restyle-buffer(3)](restyle-buffer(3)) are available to reformat
     (re-layout) selected sections of the buffer, or the whole buffer,
     respectively.

  >  Comments may be formatted using `esc o`, which reformats the comments
     according to the current fill paragraph. If a comment commences with
     `/***...` then the comment is automatically formatted to a box.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the Javascript files. The folds occur
     about the __functionn__ keyword and a closing curly brace, both at the
     beginning of a line. 

  > - [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)) (un)folds all regions in the file, 
    - [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) (un)folds the current region. 

  __Navigation via Item List__

  >  The Javascript mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying an outline
     of the functions and classes of the Javascript file for easy navigation using the 
     [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command. 

  __Abbreviations__

  >  The  installation  comes with a default  abbreviation  file for V file
     editing which  can  be  used  by  writing  short   abbreviations like
     "_for_", "_if_", "_elif_", "_func_"   or "_class_" - and then 
     pressing the key-binding  for the [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3)) command.
     The  list  of  abbreviations  can be used  interactively  in the GUI version of
     MicroEmacs using the [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) command.

  __Tags__
  
  >  A C-tags file may be generated within the editor using the __Tools__ ->
     __Javascript-Tools__ -> __Generate Tag File__. [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2)) takes the user to the file
     using the tag information.

  __Short Cuts__
  
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __C-c C-c__ - Comment out the current line.

  __dot.eaf__   - Graphviz dot abbreviation file

## EXTENSIONS


  __.dot__ - Graphviz dot file  


## DESCRIPTION


  The Graphviz __dot__ file type macro file provides simple hilighting of dot files,
  abbreviations to fastly insert specific text snippetss and item-list and folding 
  for subgraphs.

  File recognition is performed using the standard file extension __.dot__.


  __Abbreviations__

  >  The installation comes with a default abbreviation file for Dot file editing
     which can be used by writing short abbreviations like _"gr"_ (graph) , _"dg"_ 
     (digraph), _"sg"_ (subgraph) or _"nd"_ (node). 
     The short strings  are then replaced by pressing the key-binding for the 
     [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3)) command.
     The list of abbreviations can be used as well interactively in the GUI version 
     of MicroEmacs using the  [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) command.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the Dot files. The folds occur about the
     subgraph opening brace and and the closing curly brace of this subgraph. 
     The subgraph keyword and the closing curly brace should be both the first
     none whitespace character on their line.

     The following commands are supported to show and hide  the subgraph bodies. 
     
  >  [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3))     - (un)folds all regions in the file,  
     [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) - (un)folds the current region.

  __Navigation via Item List__

  >  The Dot mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying an outline
     of the subgraphs of the current Dot graph of the Dot file for easy navigation
      using the  [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command.

  __Short Cuts__
        
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __C-c C-c__ - Comment out the current line.  
     __C-c C-d__ - Uncomment the current line.  
     __C-c C-e__ - Comment to the end of the line with stars (*).  
     __A-C-i__   - Restyle the current region.  
     __esc q__   - Format a comment.  
     __esc o__   - Format a comment.  
     __f2__      - (un)fold the current region  
     __f3__      - (un)fold all regions
     __f6__      - show the item-list outline
     __Esc f6__  - hide the item-list outline

## BUGS

  None known, so far.

## DESCRIPTION


  __General Editing__
  
  >  On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
     the file. [time(2m)](time(2m)) is by default enabled, allowing the modification
     time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

  __Hilighting__
  
  >  The hilighting features allow keywords, variables, logicals,
     function or struct definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
     language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

  __Auto Layout__
  
  >  [restyle-region(3)](restyle-region(3)) and [restyle-buffer(3)](restyle-buffer(3)) are available to reformat
     (re-layout) selected sections of the buffer, or the whole buffer,
     respectively.

  >  Comments may be formatted using `esc o`, which reformats the comments
     according to the current fill paragraph.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the Julia files. The folds occur
     about the __function__, __struct__, or __macro__ keywords and a closing 
     __end__ keyword, all at the  beginning of a line. 

  > - [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)) (un)folds all regions in the file, 
    - [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) (un)folds the current region. 

  __Navigation via Item List__

  >  The Julia mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying an outline
     of the functions and classes of the Julia file for easy navigation using the 
     [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command. 

  __Abbreviations__

  >  The  installation  comes with a default  abbreviation  file for V file
     editing which  can  be  used  by  writing  short   abbreviations like
     "_fo_" (for), "_if_", "_ei_" (elsif), "_func_" (functon)  or "_openr_" (read a file) - 
     and then pressing the key-binding  for the [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3)) command.

  >  The hilighting features allow functions, logicals, comments,
     strings and characters of the language to be differentiated and
     rendered in different colors.

  __Auto Layout__
  
  >  The [indentation mechanism](indent(2)) is enabled which performs performs automatic
     layout of the text. [restyle-region(3)](restyle-region(3)) and [restyle-buffer(3)](restyle-buffer(3)) are
     available to reformat (re-layout) selected sections of the buffer, or
     the whole buffer, respectively.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the __lua__ files. The folds occur about
     __function__ definitions and their __end__ text located on the left-hand margin.

  > - [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)) - (un)folds  all regions in the file, 
    - [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) - (un)folds the current region. 

  __Navigation via Item List__

     an outline of the functions definitions
     of the Lua file for easy  navigation using the [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command.

  __Abbreviations__

  >  The  installation  comes with a default  abbreviation  file for Lua
     file  editing  which  can  be  used  by  writing  short   abbreviations
     like   _"if"_  _"wh"_ (while), or _"fu"_ (function) - and then pressing
     the key-binding for the  [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3)) command.  
     The  list  of  abbreviations  can be used  interactively  in the GUI version of
     MicroEmacs using the [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) command.

  __Tags__
  
  >  A C-tags file may be generated within the editor using the __Tools__ ->
     __Lua-Tools__ -> __Generate Tag File__. [find-tag(2)](find-tag(2)) takes the user to the file
     using the tag information.

      default is set to _"lua %f"_ where _%f_ represents the file name,
            
  > __%fhook-lua-format__ - The command to format current Lua file,
      default is set to _"luafmt"_ if this tool is installed or "restyle-buffer" 
      using MicroEmacs indentation to properly indent the current file.

  > __%fhook-lua-lint__ - The command to check/lint the current Lua file, 
       default is set to _"luac -p %f"_ where _%f_ represents
       the file name.
  
  > The setting assume that the Lua interpreter is available via the _PATH_ environment variable.

## DESCRIPTION


  The __PowerShell__ file hook provides simple hilighting of PowerShell
  files, folding, item listing, abbreviations and indentation support.

  __General Editing__
  
  >  On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
     the file. [time(2m)](time(2m)) is by default enabled, allowing the modification
     time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

  __Hilighting__
  
  >  The hilighting features allow functions, keywords, comments,
     strings and characters of the language to be differentiated and
     rendered in different colors.

  __Auto Layout__
  
  >  The [indentation mechanism](indent(2)) is enabled which performs performs automatic
     layout of the text. [restyle-region(3)](restyle-region(3)) and [restyle-buffer(3)](restyle-buffer(3)) are
     available to reformat (re-layout) selected sections of the buffer, or
     the whole buffer, respectively.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the __PowerShell__ files. The folds occur about
     __function__ definitions and their closing curly brace located on the left-hand margin.

  > - [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)) - (un)folds  all regions in the file, 
    - [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) - (un)folds the current region. 

  __Navigation via Item List__

  >  The PowerShell mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying
     an outline of the functions definitions
     of the PowerShell file for easy  navigation using the [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command.

  __Abbreviations__

  >  The  installation  comes with a default  abbreviation  file for PowerShell
     file  editing  which  can  be  used  by  writing  short   abbreviations
     like   _"if"_  _"wh"_ (while), or _"fu"_ (function) - and then pressing
     the key-binding for the  [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3)) command.  
     The  list  of  abbreviations  can be used  interactively  in the GUI version of
     MicroEmacs using the [abbrev-list(3)](abbrev-list(3)) command.

  __Short Cuts__
  
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __C-c C-c__ - Comment out the current line.  
     __C-c C-d__ - Uncomment the current line.  
     __C-c esc esc __- Command complete.  
     __f2__ - (un)fold the current region  
     __f3__ - (un)fold all regions  
     __f6__ - Display the item list.
     __esc f6__ - Hide the item list.

  __Executing, Formatting and Linting__

  > __%fhook-ps1-exec__ - The command to execute the current PowerShell file, 
      default is set to _"powershell -File \"%f\""_ where _%f_ represents the file name,
            
  > __%fhook-ps1-format__ - The command to format current PowerShell file,
      default is set to 
      _"powershell.exe -Command \"Invoke-Formatter -ScriptDefinition (Get-Content '.\%f' -Raw)\""_. 

  > __%fhook-ps1-lint__ - The command to check/lint the current PowerShell file, 
       default is set to 
       _"powershell.exe -Command \"Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path '.\%f'\""_.

  __General Editing__
  
  >  On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
     the file. [time(2m)](time(2m)) is by default enabled, allowing the modification
     time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

  __Hilighting__
  
  >  The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
     preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
     language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the Nim files. The folds occur
     about the __proc__ keyword and an following empty line.

  > - [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)) (un)folds all regions in the file, 
    - [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) (un)folds the current region. 

  __Navigation via Item List__

  >  The Nim mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying an outline
     of the functions and types of the Nim file for easy navigation using the 
     [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command. 

  __Abbreviations__

  >  The  installation  comes with a default  abbreviation  file for Nim file
     editing which  can  be  used  by  writing  short   abbreviations like
     "_fo_" (for), "_if_", "_ei_" (elif), or "_pr_" (proc) - and then 
     pressing the key-binding  for the [expand-abbrev-handle(3)](expand-abbrev-handle(3)) command.

  > __%fhook-nim-format__ - The command to format current Nim file, default  
       is set to _"nph %f"_ where %f represents the file name  
  > __%fhook-nim-lint__ - The command to check/lint the current Nim file, 
       default is set to _"nim c --verbosity:0 \"%f\""_ 
  
  > The setting assume that the _Nim_ compiler and the _nph_ formatter are available via the _PATH_
    environment variable. On Windows you must insert here either the complete 
    _PATH_ to the  _`nim`_ executable or add the folder where this file is to the

## SYNOPSIS


  swift - Swift programming language file hook

## FILES


  __hkswift.emf__ - Swift programming language hook definition  

## EXTENSIONS


  __.swift__ - Swift file


## DESCRIPTION


  The __swift__ file hook provides simple hilighting of Swift files,
  folding, item listing and indentation support.

  __Hilighting__
  
  >  The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
     preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
     language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the Swift files. The folds occur
     about the __proc__ keyword and an following empty line.

  > - [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)) (un)folds all regions in the file, 
    - [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) (un)folds the current region. 

  __Navigation via Item List__

  >  The Swift mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying an outline
     of the functions and types of the Swift file for easy navigation using the 
     [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command. 

  __Working Environment__
  
  >  [compile(3)](compile(3)) may be invoked to rebuild the source, the user is prompted
     to save any files.

  __Short Cuts__
  
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __C-c C-c__ - Comment out the current line.  
     __C-c C-d__ - Uncomment the current line.  

  >  __f2__ - (Un)fold the current region.  
     __f3__ - (Un)fold all regions.  

  >  __f6__ - Display the item list.
     __esc f6__ - Hide the item list.

## SYNOPSIS


  Haskell - Haskell programming language file hook

## FILES


  __hkhask.emf__ - Haskell programming language hook definition  

## EXTENSIONS


  __.hs__ - Haskell file


## DESCRIPTION


  The __Haskell__ file hook provides simple hilighting of Haskell files,
  folding, item-list and indentation support.

  __Hilighting__
  
  >  The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
     preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
     language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

  __Folding and Information Hiding__
  
  >  Generic folding is enabled within the Haskell files. The folds occur
     about function definitions on line with the __::__ operator and an empty
     line with no whitepace characters on it.

  > - [collapse-all(3)](collapse-all(3)) (un)folds all regions in the file, 
    - [collapse-current(3)](collapse-current(3)) (un)folds the current region. 

  __Navigation via Item List__

  >  The Haskell mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying an outline
     of the functions of the Haskell file for easy navigation using the 
     [item-list(3)](item-list(3)) command. It is required that the function definition 
     containst the __::__ operator.

  __Working Environment__
  
  >  [compile(3)](compile(3)) may be invoked to rebuild the source, the user is prompted
     to save any files.

  __Short Cuts__
  
  >  The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

  >  __C-c C-c__ - Comment out the current line.  
     __C-c C-d__ - Uncomment the current line.  

  >  __f2__ - (Un)fold the current region.  
     __f3__ - (Un)fold all regions.  

  >  __f6__ - Display the item list.
     __esc f6__ - Hide the item list.

  >  Recognized by MicroEmacs only, defines the file to be a Tcl doctools file
     regardless of the file extension.

## DESCRIPTION


  The __tman__ file type template handles the hilighting and text formating of a
  Tcl doctools man formatted text file. It supports as well folding by header sections,
  item listening of header sections, abbreviations and template insertion.

     __C-c C-e__ - Comment to End of Line  
     __C-c C-o__ - Restyle Current Comment  
     __esc q__   - Fills Paragraph
        
  >  __f2__      - Open/Close Current Collapse  
     __C-f2__    - Open/Close All Collapses         
        
  >  __S-f7__    - Enable/Disable Auto-Spell
