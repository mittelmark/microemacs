    MicroEmacs may be invoked from the command line to perform a specific set of
    filtering   tasks,  under  control  of  a  dedicated  start  up  macro,  see
    lsme(1)lmme(1)le and  lsstart-up(3)lmstart-up(3)le.  A number of standard macros  are provided, 
    most of which are invoked automatically from the editor itself  when
    requested by the user. Having said that, it has not been unknown for a
    colleague of mine to use the editor as a replacement for a more  intelligent
    cDsed(1)cA  filter,  with  12  hours  to go and a huge  ugly  3-D  geometric
    database to convert, what better way than run it through a set of MicroEmacs
    macros  to turn it into  another  database  format  that  can be  handled  -
    probably not for the  uninitiated,  but that person did pull it off and went
    home for tea !!

!   Keyboard Binding Commands
cEcEKEYBOARD BINDING COMMANDS cEcA


    Keyboard  binding  allows key strokes to be  associated  with  commands  and
    macros  such  that  when a bound  key  stroke  sequence  is  recognized  its
    associated (or bound) command is invoked, thereby  controlling the editor. A
    set of lsBindings(2)lmDefault  Bindingsle  exist for  MicroEmacs  which may be
    altered using the binding commands. There are three types of key bindings:

    cDGlobalcA
       Associates a key-stroke with a command for all buffers. Used to
       establish the standard keyboard controls i.e. cursor movement, search,
       replace etc.

    cDLocalcA
       Associates a key-stroke with a command for a specified buffer only,
       i.e. a binding local to the buffer. Local bindings allow macro
       accelerators to be bound to keys without affecting other buffers
       containing different types of data. Local bindings are used
       extensively in the buffer hook commands.

    cDMessage LinecA
       Associates a key binding for use on the command line only, allowing
       command completion to be diverted etc.

    To bind a command  to a key, the  command  and key names  must be known, see
    lsCommand  GlossarylmCommand  Glossaryle  for a complete  list of commands and
    lskeyNames(2)lmKey Namesle for a complete list of key names.

    The binding related commands are defined as follows:


cECommands  cA


    lsbuffer-bind-key(2)lmbuffer-bind-key(2)le Create local key binding for current buffer

cEVariables  cA


cEAlt Key  cA


    The cDAlt KeycA has special binding priorities defined as follows:-

    - Direct key binding (e.g. cDA-bcA executes lsfile-browser(3)lmfile-browserle)
    - Main menu hot key (e.g. cDA-fcA opens the File menu)
    - Meta key binding (e.g. cDA-spacecA -> cDesc spacecA -> lsset-mark(2)lmset-markle)

    If the  cGALTcA  key is to be used  strictly  as the  Emacs  Meta key then the
    bindings for the menu should be  over-ridden  by cCDirect Key BindingscA  from
    the user configuration file i.e. to re-map the default MicroEmacs Alt key to
    equivalent cGesccA keys then the following keys should be re-bound.

sB
          global-bind-key forward-word "A-f"      ; Over-ride File menu binding
          :                                       ; For all of the other menu items.
          :
          global-bind-key backward-word "A-b"     ; Over-ride the file browser.
          global-bind-key replace-string "A-r"    ; Over-ride tools binding.

sA
    This  creates a higher  priority  binding  which  overrides  the  underlying
    default.  The  commands  that are  displaced  would have to be  re-bound  to
    different keys if required.
!   Buffer Manipulation Commands
cEcEBUFFER MANIPULATION COMMANDS cEcA


    A buffer is where MicroEmacs  stores text. Normally text is read from
    a file and is visible in an editing lsWindow Commandslmwindowle. The name, associated
    file and  operating  modes of the buffer, are  generally  shown in the
    lsMode Linelmmode linele.

!   Operating Modes
cEcEOPERATING MODES cEcA


    cDModescA are switches (or states) that may be applied globally or on a per
    buffer basis whose settings determine how MicroEmacs operates. Modes
    affect operations within a buffer, global modes determine the modes of
    newly created buffers.

    Commands to alter the operating state:

    lsadd-global-mode(3)lmadd-global-mode(3)le Set a global buffer mode  
    lsadd-mode(3)lmadd-mode(3)le Set a local buffer mode

cEcEWINDOW COMMANDS cEcA


    MicroEmacs uses windows to display and allow you to edit the contents of
    lsBuffer Manipulation Commandslmbuffersle. Multiple windows may be present on the lsHilighting, Color and Screen Appearancelmscreenle at once, each is
    separated by a lsMode Linelmmode linele which describes the contents of the window above it.

    You can scroll text vertically and horizontally within a window by using
    the lsCursor  Movement  Commandslmcursorle  commands.  Note that if a line of text extends  beyond the
    boundary of a window, a dollar "cD$cA" sign is displayed instead of the 
    first/last visible character.

cEcEPRINTING COMMANDS cEcA


    Printing within MicroEmacs is fairly restrictive, the following commands are
    used in conjunction with the print facility.

!   Introduction to Variable Functions
!   Variable Functions
cEcEVARIABLE FUNCTIONS cEcA


    Functions can be used to manipulate variables in various ways. Functions
    have in general one, two, or three arguments. These arguments will always
    be placed after the function on the current command line. For example, if
    we wanted to increase the current fill column by two, using MicroEmacs's
    lsset-variable(2)lmset-variable(2)le (C-x v) command, we would write:

         set-variable $fill-col &add $fill-col 2
                \            \      \       \     \____second operand
                 \            \      \       \_________first operand
                  \            \      \________________function to execute
                   \            \______________________variable to set
                    \__________________________________set-variable (C-x v) command


    Functions always begin with an ampersand (cD&cA) character, and are only
    significant to the first 3 characters after the ampersand. Functions will
    normally expect one of three types of arguments, and will automatically
    convert types when needed.

    cD<num>cA
       An ASCII string of digits which is interpreted as a numeric value. Any
       string which does not start with a digit or a minus sign (-) will be
       considered zero.

    cD<str>cA
       An arbitrary string of characters. At the moment, strings are limited
       to 128 characters in length.

    cD<log>cA
       A logical value consisting of a non-zero number for cDTRUEcA (e.g. cGcG1cAcA),
       anything else is considered cDFALSEcA (e.g. cGcG0cAcA or cGcGfoocAcA). This differs
       from earlier versions of MicroEmacs where the strings cGcGTRUEcAcA and
       cGcGFALSEcAcA were used.

!   Mode Line
cEcEMODE LINE cEcA


    The cDmodeLinecA is the line of text shown at the bottom of each
    lsWindow Commandslmwindowle identifying the window being displayed.
    The mode line typically contains the name of the 
    lsBuffer Manipulation Commandslmbufferle, the file and operating mode
    associated with the buffer displayed in the window. e.g.

         #*-me (BEI) - 250 foo (foo.txt) ----------------


    cDNotecA that only a sub-set of the modes are visible on the mode line, this
    reduces the cluttering of the mode line. Use the lsabout(2)lmabout(2)le command to
    determine the exact modes that are active.

    The text content and color of the mode line is fully configurable and may
    be defined in the users start-up script. The currently active buffer is
    generally indicated by the state of the mode line, e.g. highlighted color
    (typically red) and/or double line separator characters cD===cA; conversely
    inactive buffers are shown in a dull color with single line separator
    characters cD---cA.

    The mode line may be configured or interrogated using the following
    variables:-

    ls$buffer-mode-line(5)lm$buffer-mode-line(5)le Buffer mode line string  
    ls$mode-chars(5)lm$mode-chars(5)le Mode characters

cEAnd Finally .... cA


    Answers to those burning questions that people ask from time to time ...


cEWhere does the name JASSPA come from ?  cA


    The current maintainers initials mixed up, padded out to make words, short
    listed and searched on the WWW to find a unique name. This process took
    approximately two months.


cEHow was the JASSPA logo derived ?  cA


    The logo was derived from the program initials Me. Given the limited
    number of pixels available in an icon then the 'e' was superimposed in the
    center of the 'M'. With some further refinement the legs of the 'M' were
    later lost leaving a triangular shape - this was then adopted as the
    iconic outline. The colored lines at the top and bottom portray the visual
    appearance of a JASSPA's MicroEmacs from afar when viewing an X-term
    running me within an X-Windows environment. The blue line representing the
    window header color (that I use), the red line representing the MicroEmacs
    mode bar; the screen was typically black with white or yellow characters.
    The icon was incrementally refined over a period of approximately six
    months.

    All source and macro code is covered by the GPL.

                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                   Version 2, June 1991

           Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
              59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
           Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
           of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                 Preamble

            The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
       freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
       License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
       software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
       General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
       Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
       using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
       the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
       your programs, too.

            When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
       price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
       have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
       this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
       if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
       in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

            To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
       anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
       These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
       distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

            For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
       gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
       you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
       source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
       rights.

            We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
       (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
       distribute and/or modify the software.

            Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
       that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
       software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
       want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
       that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
       authors' reputations.

            Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
       patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
       program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
       program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
       patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

            The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
       modification follow.

                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
             TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

            0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
       a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
       under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
       refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
       means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
       that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
       either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
       language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
       the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

       Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
       covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
       running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
       is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
       Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
       Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

            1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
       source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
       conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
       copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
       notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
       and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
       along with the Program.

       You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
       you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

            2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
       of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
       distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
       above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

              a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
              stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

              b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
              whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
              part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
              parties under the terms of this License.

              c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
              when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
              interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
              announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
              notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
              a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
              these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
              License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
              does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
              the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

       These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
       identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
       and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
       themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
       sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
       distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
       on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
       this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
       entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

       Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
       your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
       exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
       collective works based on the Program.

       In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
       with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
       a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
       the scope of this License.

            3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
       under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
       Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

              a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
              source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
              1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

              b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
              years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
              cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
              machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
              distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
              customarily used for software interchange; or,

              c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
              to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
              allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
              received the program in object code or executable form with such
              an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

       The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
       making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
       code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
       associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
       control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
       special exception, the source code distributed need not include
       anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
       form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
       operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
       itself accompanies the executable.

       If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
       access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
       access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
       distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
       compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

            4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
       except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
       otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
       void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
       However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
       this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
       parties remain in full compliance.

            5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
       signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
       distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
       prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
       modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
       Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
       all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
       the Program or works based on it.

            6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
       Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
       original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
       these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
       restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
       You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
       this License.

            7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
       infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
       conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
       otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
       excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
       distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
       License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
       may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
       license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
       all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
       the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
       refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

       If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
       any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
       apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
       circumstances.

       It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
       patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
       such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
       integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
       implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
       generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
       through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
       system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
       to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
       impose that choice.

       This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
       be a consequence of the rest of this License.

            8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
       certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
       original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
       may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
       those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
       countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
       the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

            9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
       of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
       be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
       address new problems or concerns.

       Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
       specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
       later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
       either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
       Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
       this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
       Foundation.

            10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
       programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
       to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
       Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
       make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
       of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
       of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                 NO WARRANTY

            11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
       FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
       OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
       PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
       OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
       MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
       TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
       PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
       REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

            12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
       WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
       REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
       INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
       OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
       TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
       YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
       PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
       POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

               How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

            If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
       possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
       free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

            To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
       to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
       convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
       the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

              <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
              Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

              This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
              it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
              the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
              (at your option) any later version.

              This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
              but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
              MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
              GNU General Public License for more details.

              You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
              along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
              Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

       Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

       If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
       when it starts in an interactive mode:

              Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
              Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
              This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
              under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

       The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
       parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
       be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
       mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

       You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
       school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
       necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

            Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
            `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

            <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
            Ty Coon, President of Vice

       This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
       proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
       consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
       library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
       Public License instead of this License.


cEGNU Free Documentation License (GFDL)  cA


    All documentation is covered by the GFDL.

            GNU Free Documentation License
               Version 1.1, March 2000

           Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
               59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
           Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
           of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

       0. PREAMBLE

       The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
       written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
       the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
       modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
       this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
       credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
       modifications made by others.

       This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
       works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
       complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
       license designed for free software.

       We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
       software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
       program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
       software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
       it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
       whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
       principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

       1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

       This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
       notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
       under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
       such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
       addressed as "you".

       A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
       Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
       modifications and/or translated into another language.

       A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
       the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
       publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
       (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
       within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
       textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
       mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
       connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
       commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
       them.

       The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
       are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
       that says that the Document is released under this License.

       The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
       as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
       the Document is released under this License.

       A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
       represented in a format whose specification is available to the
       general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
       straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
       pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
       drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
       for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
       to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
       format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
       subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
       not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

       Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
       ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
       or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
       HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
       PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
       by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
       processing tools are not generally available, and the
       machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
       purposes only.

       The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
       plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
       this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
       formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
       the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
       preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

       2. VERBATIM COPYING

       You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
       commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
       copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
       to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
       conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
       technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
       copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
       compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
       number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

       You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
       you may publicly display copies.

       3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

       If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
       and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
       the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
       Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
       the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
       you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
       the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
       visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
       Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
       the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
       as verbatim copying in other respects.

       If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
       legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
       reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
       pages.

       If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
       more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
       copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
       a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
       Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
       general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
       charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
       option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
       distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
       Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
       until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
       copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
       the public.

       It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
       Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
       them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

       4. MODIFICATIONS

       You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
       the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
       the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
       Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
       and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
       of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
             from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
             (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
             of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
             if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
             responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
             Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
             Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
             Modified Version, as the publisher.
       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
             adjacent to the other copyright notices.
       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
             giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
             terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
             and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
       I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
             it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
             publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
             there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
             stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
             given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
             Version as stated in the previous sentence.
       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
             public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
             the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
             it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
             You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
             least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
             publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
       K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
             preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
             substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
             and/or dedications given therein.
       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
             unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
             or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
       M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
             may not be included in the Modified Version.
       N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
             or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

       If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
       appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
       copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
       of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
       list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
       These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

       You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
       nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
       parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
       been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
       standard.

       You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
       passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
       of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
       Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
       through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
       includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
       by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
       you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
       permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

       The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
       give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
       imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

       5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

       You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
       License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
       versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
       Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
       list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
       license notice.

       The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
       multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
       copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
       different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
       adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
       author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
       Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
       Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

       In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
       in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
       "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
       and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
       entitled "Endorsements."

       6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

       You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
       released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
       License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
       the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
       verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

       You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
       it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
       License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
       other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

       7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

       A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
       and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
       distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
       of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
       compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
       License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
       with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
       are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

       If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
       copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
       of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
       covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
       Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

       8. TRANSLATION

       Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
       distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
       Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
       permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
       translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
       original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
       translation of this License provided that you also include the
       original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
       between the translation and the original English version of this
       License, the original English version will prevail.

       9. TERMINATION

       You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
       as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
       copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
       automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
       parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
       License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
       parties remain in full compliance.

       10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

       The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
       of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
       versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
       differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
       http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

       Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
       If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
       License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
       following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
       of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
       Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
       number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
       as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

       ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

       To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
       the License in the document and put the following copyright and
       license notices just after the title page:

                Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
                Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
                under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
                or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
                with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
                Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
                A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
                Free Documentation License".

       If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
       instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
       Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
       "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

       If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
       recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
       free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
       to permit their use in free software.

!   MicroEmacs - History
cEcEHISTORY cEcA


    This version of MicroEmacs is based on an early cCMicroEmacscA release of 3.8
    in 1988, the origins of which are unknown, except to say it was delivered
    on a unmarked 5 1/2 floppy disk.

    The program was originally ported to a Motorola MVME147 UNIX box as an
    alternative to cDvicA. Reliability of the program proved to be a problem as it
    constantly crashed. In an attempt to rectify the problems the development
    of MicroEmacs commenced.

    Development has continued from 1988 through to today, on the whole
    oblivious to further developments of the existing cDMicroEmacscA program. This
    was due to no Internet access. It was not until 1996 the next version of
    cDMicroEmacscA and cDmewincA (Microsoft Windows (TM) port of the same program) was
    downloaded from the Internet and compared. By this time MicroEmacs was
    radically different and we were not about to mesh the two together - that
    would be a step backwards.

    Development of MicroEmacs has been biased towards the UNIX platform, as
    most of the early development was performed in the UNIX domain. The first
    of the window servers was X-Windows, which in turn has shaped the
    implementation of the Microsoft Windows port. Latterly, we have seen the
    resurgence of the IBM-PC platform which is now commonplace. For the return
    port to the DOS environment, and subsequent development of the Microsoft
    Windows port, a UNIX like interface was required. Most existing users
    could not abide the primitive editors found on these machines; Microsoft
    Windows was an alien and hostile environment when compared with UNIX.
    Hence, the MicroEmacs interface utilizes UNIX style cut and paste across
    all platforms.

    For portability, MicroEmacs utilizes character rendering on all platforms
    regardless of the window manager. Under X-Windows and Microsoft Windows,
    the display is still treated as a character based display, the subtle
    difference is that the display pane is re-sizable. This means that the
    scroll bars, fonts etc. are not as slick as they could be, certainly under
    Microsoft Windows MicroEmacs looks positively primitive!! Regardless of
    the look, the goal of a common editor across all working platforms has
    been achieved!

    - [081005] Implemented a more macro orientated interface to
     get-next-line (when n == 0), which only looks in the current buffer,
     if a 'next line' is found it simply changes the cursor location,
     sets next-file & next-line variables and does not pop-open the file.
     Got get-next-line to set :next-line as well as a next-file variable.

     without going to a buffer (uses relatively recent improvements to
     shell-command)

    - [081002] File types, fixed abort caused by empty files.
    - [081002] page-file; implemented a new -u/-U option to limit the size
      of a file to be grep'd to 100Mb unless -u is given (unlimited,

      page-file-search-buffer macro.
    - [081002] page-file; Added support for specifying the buffer name to

    - [081002] Made double click on a window mode-line delete other
      windows (i.e. maximise the window)
    - [0801002] Fixed opening toolbar when notes was active in the
      session.
    - [081002] tools; added new save-kbd-macro command which makes it easy
      to save a keyboard macro for future use.

      get-next-line failures on long file names.
    - [080929] Changed the 0 & +ve args for reyank, now acts as a yank
      yanking out the nth item in the kill ring (i.e. 0 reyank == yank
      (except no external clip check))
    - [080929] Fixed bug in isearch - C-w was not storing status so a
      following backspace could lose the Okay status.

      option.
    - [080916] Added Windows MSVC 8 makefile

      to use the systems tparm function rather than ME's
    - [070311] 2dos, 2mac, 2unix, 2win; use arg 0 as these are not able to
      prompt from the user if the file is read-only - just do it.
    - [071103] cc-delete; removed bogus 'checking out parent' error
      message.

      Added file being loaded to file history.
    - [070923] jst; Added support for tables being terminated by a ]? on

      level titles.
    - [070920] Persist wrap mode in ipipe-rerun and disable compile
      hilighting when wrap is not used as very long compile lines kill
      performance (ME takes a lot of CPU)

      otherwise the hilighting persists in *compile* buffer across
      multiple compiles etc

      command without wrap (required if '&lt;filename&gt;:&lt;line&gt;: Error' lines

      new 0x10 bit flag to control the forced hiding.

      further '/' added, this fixes several file loading problems.
    - [070524] Changed file saving prompts to be like delete-buffer, they
      now given the file name first and then the 'save file' prompt so the

    - [060921] Added new bit 0x20 to lsread-file(2)lmread-file(2)le to discard changes to
      buffer.
    - [060919] Build. Added $MAKEWINDEFS and LIBS to the ME_WINDOW
      defines, removed references to xpm from the makefiles as this is not
      a standard package and moved references out of cCemain.hcA into
      cCunixterm.ccA. Vamped up build shell script to check for X11 & Xpm
      availability. Changed horrid dos style empty string tests in UNIX
      scripts with cD-zcA & cD-ncA test options

    - [060918] Changed debugger cCcG!cAcA to cCcGccAcA, in keeping with other

      string
    - [060917] Corrected the X-Windows ordering to allow us to receive
      (Un)Map events on Linux - X-Server behavior is different from Sun
      Solaris.
    - [060917] UNIX. Added XPM colour bitmap support. Just smartens the ME
      icon up in Gnome and makes ME look a bit more 21st century without
      the monochrome icon.
    - [060917] Shell template, addition of missing common commands.

    - [060915] OSD. Sanitised the quick file open and file type buffer
      open menus and changed them to use a scrolled list if more
      files/buffers than lines rather than filling the screen.
    - [060915] In notes find a file that is loaded but out of date, this
      leads to an reread prompt during which the notes ehook/idle callback
      kicks in and changes frame - this breaks the message line of both
      frames. This is a rather horrid fix to a rather grotty problem!
    - [060915] Browser, fixed the sort order to be case sensitive on UNIX,
      insensitive on Windows
    - [060914] User setup. Stopped user-setup's apply from losing the
      current session's override colour scheme
    - [060914] ClearCase. Fixed Describe context menu hotkey overload.
      Used cG-mkpathcA to implement a 'cCcheckout parentcA' for cDcc-addcA.
    - [060913] Notes. Fixed the loosing of edit and crypt mode from the
      main notes buffer due to the setting of the major mode. Fixed notes
      tree context menu hot keys.
    - [060913] Fixed kill-list tool up-date trashing the real kill ring.
    - [060912] Changed session-update to store view mode for a buffer only
      if it was forced on by the user (i.e. the file is not readonly).
      This stops files re-loading in view mode if the permissions have
      changed - this was a problem with ClearCase reported by Enver Haase.
    - [060912] Simplified the new note-setup and fixed the notes buffer
     losing the hide mode (which causes problems for session restore).
    - [060911] Removed the notes 'note' dummy hook in favour of using a
     real hook. Set the default hook to be jst but can be set in the -!-
     enf; major-mode: \<hook\> -!- header. Added new note-setup which users
     buffer-setup to allow the user to setup the buffer and stores the
     values for that note.
    - [060908] File browser, bound a lsfile-attrib(3)lmfile-attrib(3)le based 'Change File
      Attributes' option to 'g'
    - [060908] Changed lsfile-attrib(3)lmfile-attrib(3)le to handle directory buffers

      now have a Cancel button.
    - [060908] File tool, implemented new cG%"...%"cA tag to enable proper
      quoting of arguments.

      xml's insert-attrib to handle this
    - [060905] Changed refences to cCwhite-char*cA to whitespaces (i.e.
      display-white-chars is now display-whitespace) Fixed hide main menu
      to popup an info dialog informing the user how to get it back.
    - [060905] Fixed ftp dialog to conform to new cC\<user\>.erfcA setup
      standard by adding a new 'Make Default' dialog, and improved the

      strings.

      extensions .cfm, .cfml .cfc).

      types.

    - [060822] Added password commands lspassword-to-phonic(3)lmpassword-to-phonic(3)le 
      and  lsinsert-password(3)lminsert-password(3)le.

      fill-mode to the lsmajor-mode-setup(3)lmmajor-mode-setup(3)le.

    - [060810] Added 'a' for All option to the save-some-buffers prompt
    - [060810] Added save -> prompt -> delete of all buffers when loading
      another session. If bit 1 in arg is not set (i.e. 0 read-session
      "name") then this is not done and the new session is effectively
      merged into the current.
    - [060810] Added setting of main buffer modes to the buffer-setup osd.
    - [060807] Updated emulation modes to handle the new main menu.

      alphabetically and case insensitive alpha.
    - [060803] Added setting of the major mode to the new buffer-setup
    - [060803] Changed osd dialogs to use 'Cancel' or 'Close' rather than
      'Exit'

      "buffer-setup" as this is what it will become. Fixed a few hot-key
      issues with new main menu.
    - [060728] Improved help page and looked for context-menu binding to
      support esc +.
    - [060728] Moved the location of making CVS and clear-case always
      available into their setup dialog and added a C-x C-q replacement
      option.
    - [060728] Changed backspace in a directory to move to the
      sub-directory in the parent listing.
    - [060728] Fixed notes startup so it returns the user to the same
      place.
    - [060728] Documentation, replaced -ve with negative and +ve with

      into Advanced.
    - [060725] Renamed the existing tool-bar macro to toolbar-open
      (mirrors existing toolbar-close) and introduced a new tool-bar macro
      that toggles state, i.e. closes if opened. This command is more
      useful in key-bindings and menus etc.
    - [060725] Improved error handling of osd based find tag, also adding
      support for tags file being in a parent directory.
    - [060725] Removed command-line validation and relax file selection
      requirement so user can create a tool that does not require a file
      name (e.g. open . in explorer)
    - [060725] Used set/goto-position to store current dot and added \<no favorites\> entry if menu is empty.
    - [060725] Added hot-keys to the file attrib dialog
    - [060725] Changed simply fence matching of quotes and double quotes,
      if match is not found by the end or start of the line it's assumed
      to be a single and ignored.
    - [060725] Changed &mid so the 3rd argument (length) can be -ve to
      mean from the right (as per the &rig etc) - not sure why this was
      not done first time round.
    - [060624] Changed session support to handle both window and console
       environments. Changed startup to only initialize one scheme.
    - [060623] Added file-type-setup to the list of misc setups.
    - [060622] Changed buffer-setup to major-mode-setup, also changed
      buffer-help to major-mode-help etc and fixed comments. Left
      buffer-setup in buffstp as there will be a buffer-setup which really
      does setup up the current buffer. Change me.emf date to 20060606
    - [060620] Stopped session trying to change the frame for a console
      run.
    - [060619] Sessions. Stopped restore buffer's whose file does not
      exist and changed the order of frame size setting so on UNIX the
      depth of windows are maintained correctly
    - [060619] Notes. Fixed current buffer position reset problem caused
      by buffer being shown on hidden notes frame
    - [060619] Changed all ME setup macros to reload the /history registry
      before change the registry and writing it out as soon as the changes
      are accepted to reduce the likelihood of settings (like new alias
      paths) being lost. One except is when the setup is run from within
      user-setup in which case the registry is only read and written by
      user-setup, this could have some unwanted side effects. Added
      session-setup to the user-setup misc page.
    - [060619] Change to allow macros access to inactive buffers broke
      file and ipipe hooks which get executed but the buffer is officially
      made active - fixed by maintaining the BIFNACT internal flag and
      ensuring the algorithm used for inactive buffers is only used wh ere
      appropriate. Found buffer context was not set correctly for session
      buffers whose name was set to 'name\<1\>' as the BIFNAME flag is not
      set, fixed by removing this flag and using code to assess if the \<1\>
      should be removed based on the filename.
    - [060619] Fixed read-registry's replace mode which was doing a merge
      as the old node was not removed.
    - [060619] Fixed a bad prompt and added a couple of brackets to
      protect compare order.
    - [060616] Changed the start-up process to not use the history
      commands (which have been removed) but simply use the read-registry
      commands.
    - [060615] Moved the storage of all history type info into the new
      session (esf) files.
    - [060615] $user-name.erf only contains setup info and not often
      edited changed user setup to minimize the likelihood of losing edits
      (at last).
    - [060615] Broken session-setup out into its own macro file and made
      quite a few fixes to the new session support.
    - [060615] Removed the save- and read-history commands the me.emf
      start-up now simply use the read-registry command
    - [060615] Changed find-buffer to allow limited access to inactive
      buffers (allows base getting and setting of variables)
    - [060615] Changed the exit-emacs numeric argument (again) so it can
      be used by meDie (0x28 exit-emacs ~= emergency exit)
    - [060615] Created new $window-mark-line & $window-mark-col to aid
      inactive buffer support (not sure why these were not already there
      as they are usefully in macros)
    - [060615] Enabled availability of save-some-buffers by default
      (quick-exit relies on this!)
    - [060615] Changed the -c command-line option to simply set the
      variable %session-name (relies on session macros)
    - [060615] Changed clipboard support to not mess with it during
      start-up and shut-down
    - [060615] Created new change-scheme command.
    - [060615] ClearCase. Fixed *cc-state* buffer not being in view mode
      when command completes.
    - [060615] Corrected types of exchange-point-and-mark.
    - [060608] Improved OSD search dialog by making the buttons always
      enabled and reporting an error if search string is empty.
    - [060608] Made the existing hidden scheme macro a visible command
      which can be used to change the current color scheme. Set
      .scheme.current to the file name of the current scheme Saved the
      current scheme in a session so a user can create a session with its
      own different scheme.
    - [060526] Sessions. Changed to use new shut-down pseudo key.
    - [060526] Changed shut-down process to call the ehooks for the
      current buffer of all frames and changed the shut-down macro to a
      pseudo key-binding.
    - [060525] Added a new buffer-major-mode command to change the current
      buffer's hook, giving it an arg of -1 or major mode of "" removes
      the hook. No completion list yet. Fixed tab-width setting so all 3
      windows get the same new value.
    - [060525] Changed gdiff to insert the 2 files into temp buffers so if
      the files are already loaded by the user these buffers are not
      effected. Added the ability to set the tab width.
    - [060525] Fixed crash caused by watch refreshing the buffer while
      user is using isearch - stopped watch from refreshing the buffer.
    - [060525] Added a new bit 0x10 to find- read- and view-file to
      disable the context fhook evaluation.
    - [060525] UNIX fix. Call screenUpdate directly after a window resize
      fixes gdiff update problem.
    - [060523] Sessions. First serious rev of session-load and -save.
    - [060523] Added arg to tool-bar to allow the tool-bar to be
      initialized without re-reading the registry - required by new
      session support.
    - [060523] Changed left click on mode line to change to the window if
      the mouse is not moved.
    - [060523] Fixed C++ '::\<function\>() ;' indentation bug introduced
      with c++ initialize ': \<base-init\> ()' indentation support.
    - [060523] Encrypted files. Added file/host to the password prompt so
      on a -c the user should know which password is required.
    - [060523] Fixed UNIX compiler warnings
    - [060516] me.emf. Fixed missing def of file-type-setup &
      shell-tool-setup.
    - [060515] Added new bit 0x2 to arg for change-buffer-name which force
      the buffer to have the given name, changing the name of an existing
      buffer if required.
    - [060512] ClearCase. Fixed cc-setup view deletion, pressing No does
      not remove it. Removed the temporary file created by cc-diff if me's
      diff of gdiff are used, file is still left if xdiff is used.
    - [060512] Added a new $mode-chars variable which returns the letter
      ids of all modes as a string, this variable cannot currently be set.
    - [060512] Changed the numeric arguments for quick-exit and
      save-buffers-exit-emacs to make them simple to use.
    - [060510] Improved the ftp logging so errors get put into the console
      with error numbers rather than just mlwrite'd. Removed the KEEPALIVE
      as ME closes the sockets with 10mins anyway. Fix the ftp kb/s calc.
    - [060510] Dirlist. Fixed context menu so the FTP additions are added
      for any ftp:// listing.
    - [060504] Major addition to notes: a) Added forw/back note. b) added
      notes-instant and notes-context c) implemented notes-session-save
      (not done window layout yet) but not implemented the matching load
      yet. d) fixed a few annoying up-date and behavior problems.
    - [060504] ClearCase. Fixed windows \\r\\n issue with diff -
      constructed predecessor could have the wrong format breaking the
      diff.
    - [060504] Changed reyank numeric arg so if a -ve arg is given reyank
      will fail if at the end of the kill chain rather than loop -
      required for notes-session-save
    - [060504] Found differences between copy and kill-region's handling
      of narrows, particularly if there's no markup line Found I could
      crash ME if only the end part of a narrow-to is killed - buffer line
      number all go wrong. To fix the issues I've created a standard
      function to handle the expansion of narrows over a region and made
      the rule that for a narrow without a markup line to be included in
      the region at least the \\n of the previous line and 1 char of the
      container line must be included, this means that narrows at the top
      and bottom cannot be included.
    - [060504] ClearCase. Fixed cc-merge comment bug.
    - [060504] Added support for a .ascii-time.format variable which
      defines the format for the output using '%' tags as per strftime
      function (supports most tags) - output is unchanged if variable is
      not set. Fixes request by Dick Pierce. Changed the OSD insert time
      function to use the same tokens and made the first format in the
      list be the output of ascii-time.
    - [060503] Provided macro interface to get a list of alpha marks for
      the current buffer.
    - [060427] Fixed context-menu element activation issue caused by
      selected file count being wrong.
    - [060427] Fixed notes and gdiff window resize issues by locking the
      size.
    - [060426] Improved (but not quite fully fixed and I don't think I
      can) the mouse word selection when the word is half hidden at the
      left or right edge of the window.
    - [060425] Fixed bug with setting $window-line, if value is \< 1 then
      the goto-line function prompts the user, this is incorrect behavior
      for a set variable command and the cause of a mouse driver spin.
      Fixed mouse left button spin caused by missing the pick event and a
      bug in set-variable for $window-line. Added new horizontal scroll
      feature when user clicks on a $window-char truncated line char.
    - [060421] JSP. Fixed java \<%...%\> within JavaScript start token
    - [060421] Fixed C++ comment hilighting
    - [060413] Added an abort-command safty trap to reset the
      $buffer-input variable.
    - [060413] JSP. Fixed most JSP hilight and indent issues caused by
      java and javascript confusions.
    - [060412] Bug fix. Put checks in to ensure the hilight/indent to be
      used according to a look-back scheme has been defined - fixes crash
      when viewing JSP files.
    - [060403] DIRECTORY LISTING. Fixed 'not-exist' fix in last commit -
      ftp dir lists can be only a couple of lines Made file/dir copy
      automatically try 3 times before prompting the user (large ftp
      copies will fail at points). Fixed browse mode close problem when
      browse deletes the buffer.
    - [060402] Used an ehook and a callback to auto detect a change in the
      notes frame buffer/window layout, if there is a change the callback
      closes the notes frame. This approach resolves many issues.
    - [060331] Fixed XML magic hook.
    - [060331] Fix annoying find-zfile last buffer history change. Changed
      the buffer & file name of a loaded zfile file to something more
      useful.
    - [060331] Created a '2 find-buffer \<file-name\>' arg which finds an
      existing buffer via its file name - used to fix annoying find-zfile
      buffer history change.
    - [060330] Fixed CVS & CC context menu placement issues. Fixed cc-add
      to use -mkpath for directories
    - [060330] Change fhook-dir to always detect if its a
      source-controlled dir and call the SC hook, the SC hook can then add
      its own bindings etc. Fixed fhook-dir so loading of ".../not-exist/"
      does not error.
    - [060330] Made the esc = & esc + menu bindings global.
    - [060329] Changed unix start-up mode to favor X over termcap if
      DISPLAY is set, even if term is a vt100.
    - [060329] Fixed mode-line udate bug when all edits are undone -
      reported by Tom Hundt.
    - [060322] Fixed the position of the context menu when opened by mouse
      or menu key. Fixed auto-spell not being available when context menu
      is opened using the menu key.
    - [060322] Improved gdiff-next command to error at the end of the file
      so the use knows they have reached the end. Bound 'menu' to open the
      contex menu and bound 'esc up' & 'esc down' to move between
      unassigned sections.
    - [060322] Bound f10 to close the notes frame and bound C-x k to a new
      notes-delete command
    - [060317] ClearCase. Added new cc-merge command (which uses
      cleartool's findmerge command!). Added new cc-describe command
      (which uses cleartool's describe command), fixed the CC context
      menu.
    - [060317] Directory listing. Increased 2Gb directory file size limit
      to 4Gb by making size variables meUInt.
    - [060317] Fixed '\\' quoting in command-wait example.
    - [060316] Up-dated docs for command-wait, added some meaty examples
      and added cross references to them.
    - [060316] indent fix
    - [060316] Changed describe-word osd dialog so that it has a 'Look Up'
      button which is the default. Also improved the insert description
      process so C-w kills the description inserted.
    - [060316] Improved the behaviour of the enter key in the help osd so
      it does a search or nothing.
    - [060315] Fixed a win32 console crash caused by the new frame
      reposition function. Stopped the messing about of the windows
      console when ME is in piped mode.
    - [060309] Fixed regex \\a -> \\g for bell and added support for \\a &
      \\m to [...] character classes.
    - [060309] Updated *shell-command docs.
    - [060309] Documented &lef, &mid & &rig -ve 2nd arg usage.
    - [060309] Documented insert-string's -ve arg.
    - [060309] Up-dated goto-matching-fence docs
    - [060309] Fixed docs for when no arg is given to forward-kill-word.
    - [060309] Updated jst template to new version. Fixed a couple of bugs
      with tables (empty cells and bad indent) Implemented a table cell
      '!' flag to indicate a start of a row (helps debugging) Fixed bug
      when title variable not set.
    - [060309] ClearCase. Minor improvement to setup layout
    - [060222] Exit handling fixed, saving of modified buffers, history,
      spell dictionaries etc. "**Emergency Exit**" messages removed from
      exit handling.
    - [060214] Corrected user setup mouse defaults - missing wheel mouse
      default bindings.
    - [060214] Improved the php look-back scheme to identify php script
      quicker.
    - [060213] Fixed crash caused by the new hilight look back scheme
      using the indent look back function which used the indent scheme
      rather than the hilight scheme
    - [060210] Improved php hilighting by making use of the new
      look-back-scheme and look-back-only-token features.
    - [060210] Improved the time printout
    - [060210] Benchmark tests. Improved the disptest.
    - [060210] ClearCase. Fixed cc-add when adding just a directory.
    - [060210] Added basic mouse support to browser and honours exit
      bindings
    - [060210] Added look-back-scheme support to hilighting (uses same
      code as indents quick-lookback scheme). Added new 'only use during
      look-back' hilight token (combined 0x800 & 0x200) which can solve
      make multi-line string hilighting issues.
    - [060210] Fixed compiler warning with -m changes
    - [060210] Removed unused variable in new reposition function
    - [060210] Fixed unused variable on NDEBUG build
    - [060209] Made changes to the -m server message option to make it
      usable. a) Process the message using the macro 'token' function so
      \\n is translated to a new-line char. b) If the message is not
      terminated with a \\n then one is added. c) The popup-window message
      it only given when -o option is used
    - [060209] Added support for a server 'M' message command.
    - [060209] Changed the hilight and indent meHilight structure mis-uses
      access the data via #define (added to estruct.h) so the code is
      clean and easy to read and the miss uses can be easily found and
      changed. Changed the storage of the main indent and hilight scheme
      flags to use the ignore field (only 5 bits currently used) so the
      trunc scheme can use the type and the hilight look back can use the
      close (i.e. unlimited).
    - [060209] Fixed clear-case update list on checkin option.
    - [060208] Fixed crash caused by mlGetStringFromUser being called
      recursively - only possible since the introduction of ftp completion
      which can prompt for the user password while inputting a file name.
    - [060207] Added an implementation of meFrameRepositionWindow for
      XTerm, not a very good one as there is not a clear standard between
      WMs.
    - [060207] Fixed obscure crash caused by horizonal scroll mode 2 and
      long lines.
    - [060202] Build script. Fixed MS-Window's typo.
    - [060201] ClearCase + CVS. Fixed hiding of *??-console* buffer and
      closing the window with loading a file from a dir list.
    - [060127] Broke the user-setup 'Tools' 'File Types' and 'EMail' pages
      out into separate independent setup dialogs. Added new Miscellaneous
      page to user-setup with links to these and other setup dialogs (such
      as alias-path and file-tool) Changed the buttons to the more
      standard Okay, Apply Cancel. Slightly changed some of the Mail & VM
      registry settings to make each platform independent (except
      filtering).
    - [060127] ClearCase. Added new cc-delete and alias-path-setup
      commands. Added f4 to diff binding. Moved the window resizing call
      to nearer the end (after the font resize as this could change to a
      smaller font allowing more lines etc).
    - [060127] Fixed quite a few issues with the CVS and clear-case UI
      interfaces. Brought cvs-state into line with CC, implemented
      cc-delete and rationalised the hot-keys and context menus.
    - [060127] Added new alias-path-setup OSD gui.
    - [060127] Added new 3 and 4 arg to popup-window to manipulate the
      main frame window, implemented meFrameRepositionWindow function on
      windows.
    - [060127] Fixed find-reg index in error message.
    - [060127] Moved macro parser's \\a to \\g (bell) and added support
      for \\a - alpha and \\m - alpha-num to hilight and regex.
    - [060125] Changed the default debug for 'deb' abbrev to 2.
    - [060125] Improved the hilighting of html &???; chars - issue raised
      by Tom Hundt
    - [060124] Fixed crash caused by moving right (cursor key) into a
      sub-menu with no active items - bug found by Tom Hundt.
    - [060122] gdiff. Fixed the bugs introduced with the 3rd 'current
      line' window was introduced.
    - [060122] Changed call from saveExitEmacs to exitEmacs to avoid
      compile errors for NE.
    - [060122] Fixed the meDie function to not exit straight after the
      emergency exit message, now autosaves as it should. Change the
      handling of the CLOSE message on windows so it prompts okay/cancel
      if buffers need saving and then exits. Fixed really annoying
      modifier state mismatch problem on windows - reproduce by pressing
      control right-click on title bar to get the system menu and then
      release the control, ME misses the C-drop event so thinks its still
      pressed.
    - [051220] JST extensions.
    - [051219] JST. Added implementation of TOC to html export.
    - [051219] ClearCase. Disable check out of parent dir for cc-add as
      its not implemented
    - [051215] JST. Changed tag highlighting to handle split line tags
      correctly. Implemented support for f and b color export to HTML
      using style.
    - [051215] First commit of new v4 JST format hook and export macros.
    - [051215] Fixed the return value of transpose-lines command which was
      always returning false causing cc-add to fail.
    - [051212] SQL Template. Missing hilight statement causes execution to
      fail - Thanks to Th.
    - [051212] Fixes to old JST before it gets trashed
    - [051125] Fixed regex bug where "[\\s]" incorrectly matches an 's'
    - [051125] ClearCase. Added support for not loaded to cc-state
    - [051123] Added support for alias-paths.
    - [051122] Fixed highlight problems with "^ *$" & "^\\\\s*$" close
      bracket tags, they should match any line containing only
      spaces/white-spaces but they did not work reliably.
    - [051122] ClearCase. Fixed the cc-diff, external diff settings had
      got muddled.
    - [051122] Directory listing. Changed the size ordering to list
      largest first on initial sort.
    - [051118] ClearCase. Implemented the auto get checkout comment and
      removed the temp command-line buffer.
    - [051118] Directory listing window. Added binding of 'f' to toggle
      the filter and changed the 's' and 'S' bindings round (s is far more
      useful)
    - [051118] Improved the horizontal scrolling of gdiff and browse
    - [051110] Make debugger stop at executed !elif & !else will work for
      all macros, may not work when executing a buffer as the line may
      start with a white space.
    - [051110] Stopped osd check-box macros from triggering the debugger
      when $debug is set to 1.
    - [051110] Added some more key translations based on bug report by
      Francesco Abbate.
    - [051104] 2nd and much improved version of cc-setup. Changed to using
      -1 insert-string to allow multi-line comments. Fixed horrid problem
      with cleartool's handling of checking out a file when its been
      hijacked, no command-line option to make it use the hijacked file me
      has to use ipipe-write a send 'yes' at the prompt, but as the prompt
      is not given me must be preempt and send them first, one for each
      file - clear-case is pants and cleartool sucks.
    - [051104] Changed cmd-line construction to use -1 insert-string to
      insert \\n's into the line - not really very nice.
    - [051104] Fixed meGetChar to be like GetString in that if running a
      macro the value has not been given it goes directly to the user
      rather than simply failing, this improves macro reliability and
      eases debugging of macros.
    - [051104] Multi-line shell fix. The new 0x100 flag to shell-command
      has one drawback, you cannot run commands that include newline
      characters as the cmd-line must be on the first line. But CVS and
      clear-case commit comments are often multi-line so this is not
      acceptable. To fix the problem I have added a -ve arg to
      insert-string comment which then performs a literal insertion, i.e.
      every char including a \\n char is inserted are text. This fixes the
      immediate problem but inserting a \\n char in a line can break other
      thing in a very major way (like undo) so it must be used with
      extreme care.
    - [051103] ClearCase. First rev of a CC tool defaults setup in
      cc-setup. Moved CC over to using 0x100 bit in shell-command to
      remove command-line length limit.
    - [051102] Moved multiple-file file-tool executions over to using the
      new 0x100 shell-command flag (first line of buffer) to remove
      command-line length limit in almost all cases (cmd has a 4kb limit)
    - [051102] Introduced a new 0x100 bit for shell commands which means
      the 'cmd-line' given is a buffer names whose first line holds the
      command-line to run.
    - [051028] ClearCase. Fixed cc-diff abort when a file has no
      differences. Added a 'delete line' function to cc-state bound to
      C-k.
    - [051019] Visual basic highlighting - added And Or and Xor operators.
    - [051013] Unix shell window, corrected highlighting of backslash
      escape character outside of a string enclosure.
    - [051011] ClearCase extensions. Added button to cc-checkin to get
      checkout comment. In cc-state - fixed file selection on last empty
      line and mouse selection and added support for mouse drag selection.
    - [051011] Changed dirlist copy/move to preserve the original files
      time stamp.
    - [051011] Fixed windows rename to check the to name is case
      insensitively different.
    - [051011] Implemented file time-stamp preservation in the file-op
      copy and move.
    - [051011] Improved the window-popup on windows, more likely to work
      but can still fail.
    - [051011] Fixed UNIX drag-n-drop, broken by -l l:c addition.

      submission - thanks for the submission.
    - [051007] ClearCase. Removed VOB option from cDcc-statecA as it did not
      work. Made cDcc-consolecA read only and better integrated including
      supporting it as a toolbar tool (like cvs-console).
    - [051007] Fixed bad variable assignment in directory list macros.
    - [051001] Corrected Sun Solaris x86 makefile to use the Sun Native
      compiler.
    - [050930] ClearCase. Fixed cDcc-statecA to check the state of selected

      command-line) Added support for config-spec viewing and editing.
      Added directory refresh option for checkin/out add etc. Added many
      improvements to cc-state buffer support, hilighting, file listing
      style sorting and selection (i.e. following are bound
      cG1cA,cG2cA,cG3cA,cG+cA,cG-cA,cGucA,cGacA,cG*cA)
    - [050930] cDfile-toolcA, changed the buffer list toolbar tool to keep the
      current line to the current buffer when using cDfind-buffercA etc.
    - [050930] Latest cCMirkwoodcA update from Bruno.
    - [050930] Fixed ftp drag'n'drop copy bug, the source dir needed an
      file: prefix to remove the cGftp://cA of the current buffer. While test
      I blew away my home directory, nasty way to discover that ftp can
      return cG"..cGcA not cGcA../cGcA and cGcA.."cA is not ignored when deleting! Fixed.
    - [050929] File listing, stopped copy, move etc commands from
      accepting cG'../cCcA when its the current line Fixed cGcAv'cA browse file open
      and close.
    - [050928] browse, removed the delete buffer flag from browse - wrong
      way to do this.
    - [050928] ClearCase, make cDcc-annotatecA work if file is checked out
      (cleartool command-line is awful, why do you have to pay money to
      use this rubbish?)
    - [050928] Added wrap feature to cDbrowsecA mode.
    - [050928] Changed cCMirkwoodcA main OSD scheme to make current focus item
      more visible.
    - [050920] Changed the $debug variable to be bit based as its old
      values just could implement the required functionality.
    - [050920] Latest cCMirkwoodcA highlight scheme - added underlining for
      spelling errors
    - [050920] OAD, added a comment tab to the scheme editor and up-graded
      the scheme selectors to use combo-boxes.
    - [050920] Fixed compile error on macos caused by bad macro
      definition.
    - [050919] Fixed 2 bugs: meRegHead's force could be left set to 1
      which has the side effect of cGC-gcA not hiding the active region. Due
      to last change to cDcommand-waitcA the screen is not up-dated before
      waiting for a key breaking cDgdiffcA.
    - [050919] Readability update to cCMirkwoodcA highlight scheme.
    - [050919] Changed ClearCase cDcc-statecA to handle file names with cCcG[cAcAs
      in them.
    - [050915] Added Up, Down, Hide window and default open options to the
      cDfile-toolcA setup GUI. Added support for a default open to the
      directory listing, pressing return now checks for a cDfile-toolcA
      default open (explorerish), cCcGocAcA for open always loads the file into
      me.
    - [050915] Added support for dbx on sunos. Changed the ipipe input
      mode to be toggled using cGf3cA rather than set via cGf2cA, cGf3cA or cGf4cA.
    - [050915] cDzfilecA, fixed filename -> absolute file name when given as
      an macro arg - should be based off current buffer's path.
    - [050908] Added cDfile-toolcA.
    - [050908] ClearCase, fixed cG%diff-comcA definition problem and
      cDcc-uncheckoutcA buffer update problem. Fixed cDcc-checkoutcA and
      cDcc-checkincA buffer update problems as well.
    - [050908] Improved the diff highlight, more readable and correct.
    - [050908] Added new cCMirkwoodcA highlight scheme.
    - [050806] Added better support for MinGW. Fixed the console color bug
      and most of the compiler warnings. Added support for the MSYS shell
      by creating a unix style cGmingw.gmkcA (uses rm instead of del etc)
      updating the old cGmingw.gmkcA and renamed to cGmingw32.gmkcA and added
      support to the unix build script.
    - [050803] Fixed cDnecA crash when an unbound key is pressed, bug
      introduced with last commits.
    - [050721] Fixed annoying mouse refocus in osd dialog even though
      mouse is not moved - another windows nasty.
    - [050720] File browser, added directory closing binding to cCcGccAcA and
      cCcG+cAcA cCcG-cAcA windows compatible bindings.
    - [050720] Pop-up menus, shifted the context menu down one line when
     opened by a key.
    - [050720] Directory listing. Changed the tag file list macro to
      support moving to the closest selected so the user can see which
      files they are deleting! Improved the file-tool so cG\\HcA will see a
      hot-key, cCcG\\cAcA chars and cCcG"cAcA must be quoted (i.e. cCcG\\\\cAcA & cCcG\"cAcA)
      Bound cCcGtcAcA to open the file tool menu directly so tools can be easily
      executed without use of the mouse.
    - [050720] Source code reorganisation. Standardized the # preprocess
      forms, removed 2 uses of #elif and cplusplus and changed odd
      cCcGdefined(_BSD)cAcA style bracketing which the cDc-hash-evalcA does not
      handle.
    - [050720] Removed unused functionality from NE. Made the following
      available as extended functionality: cDbackward-delete-tabcA,
      cDchange-buffer-namecA, cDchange-file-namecA, cDdefine-macro-filecA,
      cDdelete-blank-linescA, cDdelete-some-bufferscA, cDnamed-buffer-modecA,
      cDsave-some-bufferscA, cDsave-buffers-exit-emacscA, user(cG%cA), buffer(cG:cA) and
      command(cG.cA) variables, cD$buffer-inputcA, cD$kept-versionscA, cD$mouse*cA.
      cD$pause-timecA, cD$MEBACKUPPATHcA. Removed cD-ccA from ne's help page as this
      is not supported. Moved macro regex cD&xseqcA, cD&xrepcA based directives
      and most cD@cA variables to extended functionality.
    - [050719] Organiser address search broken due to recent changes to
      macro argument getting. Fixed by changing the numeric argument which
      was ambiguously defined.
    - [050718] Source code reorganisation. Made the file hook variables
      and HideBuffer function statics. Changed ne to use fixed char groups
      for isUpper etc rather than the large look-up tables as it does not
      have cDset-char-maskcA to configure them anyway.
    - [050718] C template. Fixed and greatly simplified the #if handling
      in the hash eval code. Added support for cG#undefcA.
    - [050715] Source code organisation. Removed unused code when there's
      no ipipe support. Hashed out location functions which are only
      required by socket or ipipe support.
    - [050714] Combined cDcc-logcA and cDcc-annotatecA into a single cDcc-annotatecA
      cammon with GUI. Added cDcc-vtreecA and cDcc-explorercA.
    - [050714] Fixed cDuser-setupcA setting of number of backups and Ignore
      files settings.
    - [050714] Fixed cDfile-opcA copy so the source file's attributes are
      preserved (i.e. remains read only etc). Implemented the 4th
      parameter (attribs) in cD&stat icA Implemented a cDfile-opcA chmod using arg
      bit cG0x200cA.
    - [050712] Corrected NE build under Windows, console build including
      windows calls.
    - [050712] Directory listing, fixed delete copy and move prompts, flag
      cG0x08cA got changed to cG0x04cA in cDfile-opcA.
    - [050712] Implemented a proper ClearCase context diff by recreating
      the old file from the diff and then calling a real diff program.
    - [050712] Changed the diff hilighting to be just one scheme as a CC
      diff could contain a gdiff style for files and diff style for
      directories.
    - [050712] Corrected NE build problem with macro debugging.
    - [050711] Corrected Latex template load error in cGhklatex.emfcA
      (detected with cG$debug=1cA).
    - [050710] Fixed old cG$debugcA interface, found a long forgotton mode 3
      (now 4) which simply prints the current line without waiting, this
      broken the new mode 3.
    - [050709] Removed the cD-dcA command line option - pointless.
    - [050709] Improved the macro command argument handling to get missing
      arguments from the user, i.e. having a macro line of: cDfine-filecA
      Works okay.
    - [050709] Vastly improved the macro debugging, the cD$debugcA value of 1
      is now 2, 2 -> 3, a value of 1 now tells the user of any unhandled
      failures.
    - [050709] Fixed the Windows window resizing behaviour to be a lot
      more usable. The window size now increases in character size steps
      rather than bouncing around and the window is refresh as its
      changed. The Horizontal width limit of the window has effectively
      been removed (set to 400 chars) the depth is still restricted to the
      screen size, issue raised by Tom Hundt.
    - [050709] Added new file tools interface, creating windows explorer
      type file name based tools (e.g. extracting a zip file).
    - [050709] Added ClearCase cDcc-logcA and cDcc-annotatecA (similar to cvs's
      commands)
    - [050709] Stopped the default file hook from creating a bogus tool
      menu and help page.
    - [050709] Fixed the previous-line macro and the kill-word key
      bindings.
    - [050709] Changed the menu items which open a sub dialog to having
      cCcG...cAcA in their name as per the gui standard, issue raised by Tom
      Hundt.
    - [050708] Changed sub-menu display chars, auto open menus are now '
      cG>cA' and manual are cCcG+cAcA, issue raised by Tom Hundt.
    - [050708] Got thoroughly fed up with the emacs style cDkill-wordcA -
      useless. Came up with a compromise, if no numeric arg is given then
      it works the old way, if an argument is given (i.e. 1, 2 ...) it
      works in like emacs (which makes sense as you are asking it to kill
      1 word etc.)
    - [050708] Changed cDlist-commandscA and cDcommand-aproproscA to not list
      hidden macros by default. They can be listed if bit 1 of the numeric
      argument is clear (aka cDlist-bufferscA)
    - [050625] Updated mode line letter mnemonics which were out of date,
      issue raised by Tom Hundt.
    - [050625] Stop me crashing when describe-variable is given something
      like "cD&orcA", now restricted to variables of type cG#cA, cG$cA, cG%cA, cG:cA, cG.cA only.
    - [050618] Added support for -ve offests to cD&lefcA, cD&midcA, cD&rigcA functions
      to go from the end of the string.
    - [050618] Created a cCno waitcA option to cDshell-commandcA so processes can
      be launched and forgotten about. Also added support for all the
      other process launch flags present in pipe and ipipe shell commands.
      Removed some very dead code.
    - [050618] Avoided a 'cD&mid -1cA' in display matching fence (cGdmf.emfcA) by
      restructuring the logic a bit.
    - [050616] Revision 3 of ClearCase support.
    - [050614] Second rev of clearcase support. restructured the execution
      of cleartool so ipipes are used (even though the user may not be
      able to edit) giving feedback on progress. Implemented a basic diff
      which can only diff one file at a time and only with its predecessor
      but at least it supports a context output of sorts!
    - [050614] Fixed cDcommand-waitcA when no arg is given to return when a
      callback sets the cG.waitcA variable. Command now returns imediately if
      the cG.waitcA variable is not defined. Fixed windows sleep function
      which was managing to break out before it should.
    - [050612] latex added macros for bold/italic/mono character
      formatting.
    - [050612] nroff region support for character formating.
    - [050612] cD.fhook-xxx.command-ncA syntax added to cDbuffer-initcA to
      simplify comamnd definition.
    - [050610] Removed "cDC-c C-gcA" key binding in document macros and
      replaced with "cDC-c \<cA" because of cDC-gcA issue.
    - [050610] CVS added support for a cDcvsco.etfcA checkin template.
    - [050610] First revision of ClearCase support, very incomplete and
      primative but the hooks required in the rest of the system are in
      place.
    - [050609] Changed the directory listing so cCcG.cAcA is removed and cG..cA is
      always the first cCfilecA and cannot be selected. Fixed some directory
      display annoying refresh issues.
    - [050609] First implementation of directory deletion, copying and
      moving, including support for ftp directories etc. Areas of concern
      are still copied file's permissions and to a lesser degree
      ownership. Also the copies behaviour with symbolic links, this must
      be tested further.
    - [050609] Fixed file permissions and ftp minor issues a couple of
      major ftp bugs and cD$file-namescA working for ftp directories.
    - [050609] Added new cD&statcA cGcGicAcA flag and argument bit 4 to cDfile-opcA to
      abort on a problem rather than prompt, it also returns an error code
      in cC$resultcA.
    - [050609] Changed the kill word commands so have the same word
      boundary behaviour as cDforward-wordcA and Emacs (was killing word only
      then whitespaces only etc). Corrected word movement and killing
      command's EOB and BOB error handling.
    - [050608] Added new cDrdiffcA (recursive diff) command
    - [050608] Updated cDstring-rectanglecA and cDspace-rectanglecA to improve its
      usability.
    - [050608] Updated cDdescribe-wordcA setup comment.
    - [050601] Corrected cGne.emfcA, broke Window mode in disabling console
      mode for cDne -RcA option change.
    - [050601] Corrected crash on hilight with alpha-numerics of form
     cG[[:digit:]]cA when spelt incorrectly.

    cD8th Release - May 2005cA
 
    Release date specified as 2005/05/05.

    - [050508] JASSPA MicroEmacs 8th release - final. Core and macro
      versions 20050505.
    - [050514] Fixed ftp copy lock-up (most noticable on windows) caused
      by the response read at the start of a command also reading (and
      disgarding) the finishing message so ME hangs at the end of the
      command waiting for a response.

      process so the pclose call cannot get the process's exit code
      (returns -1).

      on a termcap screen.
    - [050427] Fixed nasty bug with transpose-line at the end of the
      buffer swapping the last line with the first!
    - [050427] main.c - Fixed minor compiler warnings.
    - [050426] Added a binding for file completion (any key bound to
      insert-tab) so OSD dialogs can do completion (although awkwardly).
    - [050423] Fixed wiki edit mode for Russian keyboards, the 'k' flag
      key mapping was breaking things.

      submitted by Nicholas Kudriavtsev
    - [050331] Added support for the setting of the history in macros via
      @h#.
    - [050325] registry.c - removed compiler warning indicating porting
      problem hilighted under Darwin. Post increment of variable on left
      of assignment and same variable appeared on the right, split out the
      increment to reduce ambiguity of the statement.
    - [050320] UNIX only - add a rule for .dir files found in the X11

      cDletter(2m)cA, cDline(2m)cA etc. changed the mode byte assignment of some
      modes. The built in global mode default was not updated for this
      change in bytes and incorrect global modes appeared as a result -
      specifically cDquiet(2m)cA which has jumped bytes.
    - [050315] LEX/YACC template - Corrected LEX and YACC highlighting.
      Aligned C, C++ and YACC/LEX templates to be consistent.
    - [050315] C/C++ templates - buffer setup modified for GNU Indent
      Style setting.
    - [050315] Added new lsbrowse(3)lmbrowse(3)le command and binding to f3, changed
      existing collapse-all cDf3cA binding to cDC-f2cA.
    - [050315] Modified ME exit commands to support a bitwise arg n where
      main lsexit-emacs(2)lmexit-emacs(2)le has cC`0x01 Prompt`cA, '0x02 Save each buffer/reg/dic
      (with prompt if 0x01 set)' and '0x04 Prompt for exit code and exit
      ME with that code.'
    - [050313] Latex template - Corrected the latex-fill-paragraph. Set
      the fill-mode to 'cDlcD' rather than 'cALcA' because its a pain when it
      selects centre rather than left and messes things up.
    - [050311] Directory list - changed column sorting so Modified is
      sorted most recent first.
    - [050311] Fixed perldb pipe operation.
    - [050310] OSD simplified the main context menu and moved paste a cvs
      items in the directory context menu
    - [050310] Fixed diff's file name input, was not completing correctly
    - [050310] CVS changed the default setting of the recursive add to
      off.
    - [050310] JASSPA MicroEmacs quick start document released.
    - [050309] Fixed bug in regex multi-line search backwards, searching
      for cGcGfoo[^a]cAcA is a mult-line as cG[^a]cA matches cG\\ncA, if cGcGfoobcAcA exists
      at the start of the line isearch-backward refuses to move on.
    - [050309] Catman pages added for ne(1) and me(1) complaints with
      gentoo as missing. Added to the package builds.
    - [050308] Fixed a nasty bug with ftp connect dialog when the host has
      a port. Changed the default path to be nothing which becomes cG/~/cA to
      list the login directory. Change the tab order to not include the
      password as tabbing through the entry will lose the password, must
      now access via mouse or hot key which is not ideal.
    - [050308] Added support for relative ftp browsing via new
      cGftp://???/~/???cA url form. Added file name completion support for ftp
    - [050306] Corrected the docmacro` http://` regular expression.
    - [050306] Changed the date format of the cD-VcA command line option to
      include the century, same format as the lsabout(2)lmabout(2)le buffer.
    - [050302] HTLP and PHP - fixed lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le problems.
    - [050302] Perl template - fixed indent problems caused by not
      skipping the cG=~cA type regular expressions.
    - [050302] TCL template - fixed continuation and comment indent bug.
    - [050302] Added support for R/S-plus (.r) files - thanks to Detlef.
    - [050225] HTML template - fixed an indent which was fixed at cGcG2cAcA
      rather than cGcGtcAcA and added comment skipping indent rules
    - [050225] lsdos2unix(3f)lmdos2unix(3f)le, lsunix2dos(3f)lmunix2dos(3f)le and lsunix2win(3f)lmunix2win(3f)le - Removed use
      of cD&sprcA in favor of cD&catcA so cGdos2unixcA etc. work in lsne(1)lmne(1)le. [050225]
      Tracing a problem with hilighting a token of the form cGcGAB*$cAcA, works
      if there is a cCcGBcAcA but fails if there are no cCcGBcAcAs, i.e. only matches
      cGcGAB+$cAcA. Found that removing the end of line special case code fixes
      the problem. I believe the rest of the code has been improved to
      handle any end-of-line quirks - I hope so!
    - [050225] Removed the cCcGstart-upcAcA macro function compile option so all
      versions support this - cGcGnecAcA can now do a cGcG@dos2unixcAcA
    - [050225] Regular expressions - extended replacement string syntax.
      Added support for cGcG\c#cAcA cGcG\l#cAcA and cGcG\u#cAcA to change the case of
      groups, where cGcG\c#cAcA is capitalise, cGcG\l#cAcA is lower cGcG\u#cAcA is upper and
      cGcG#cAcA is the group number (cG0-9cA, cG&cA)
    - [050225] Regular expressions - changed syntax of cGcG\s?cAcA and cGcG\S?cAcA in
      favor of Perl's simpler cGcG\scAcA and cGcG\ScAcA for a whitespace char class.
      Added new character classes cGcG\dcAcA = digits, cGcG\DcAcA != digits cGcG\hcAcA =
      hexdigits cGcG\HcAcA != hexdigits cGcG\lcAcA = lowercase cGcG\LcAcA != lowercase cGcG\ucAcA
      = uppercase and cGcG\UcAcA != uppercase. These changes were made to both
      the main regex search engine and the lshilight(2)lmhilight(2)le token matching
      engine. Added support for char classes within the main regex cG[...]cA
      character class, i.e. now supports regexs like cGcG[\l\u_]cAcA for any
      lower, upper or cCcG_cAcA char. This is not supported in the hilight which
      currently has a more simplistic cGcG[...]cAcA char class support.
    - [050225] Regular expressions - changed use of cG`\s `cA, cGcG\s-cAcA, cG`\S `cA
      and cGcG\S-cAcA classes to simply cGcG\scAcA and cGcG\ScAcA which is perl regex
      compliant (ditching Emacs cGcG\scAcA syntax as it is cumbersome and not
      very useful). The only nasty side effect is hilight's miss-use of
      cGcG\S1cAcA - cGcG\S9cAcA to mean not cGcG\1cAcA - cGcG\9cAcA group char, changed to cGcG\!1cAcA -
      cGcG\!9cAcA
    - [050224] lsne(1)lmne(1)le set to not auto-save or create backups by default.
    - [050224] Added cGcG-acAcA and cGcG-BcAcA command line options to enable and
      disable auto-save lsauto(2m)lmauto(2m)le and lsbackup(2m)lmbackup(2m)le modes.
    - [050224] Tcl template - some more fixes to the item list from Detlef
    - [050224] lswatch(3)lmwatch(3)le improved the refresh rate of a type 2 or 3 watch
      by ignoring the cG:watch-timecA and just look at the cG:watch-sizecA. Fixed
      the split line issue with type 2 of 3 watching caused by last line
      not being complete.
    - [050224] cDM-xcA cDftpcA - stripped cCcGftp://cAcA and any trailing cCcG/cAcA of the
      users entered host name as these break ftp. Improved the dialog's
      handling of passwords, the user can now tell if a password has been
      set.
    - [050224] Added standard binding for mark-function
    - [050224] Fixed the ME token hilighting in the C hook
    - [050224] Removed recently added cG%no_backupcA variable to disable
      backup create as new cD-BcA option is a much better way of doing it.
    - [050224] cGedef.hcA - Removed definition of non-existant variable
    - [050224] Fixed failure when trying to load cGcGhttp://www.jasspa.comcAcA,
      there is an implicit trailing cCcG/cAcA which MicroEmacs now adds.
    - [050224] Tcl template - major improvement - courtesy of Detlef.
    - [050224] Fixed cDcollapsecAto support the file hooks .exact setting (set
      to -1 means case insensitive)
    - [050224] Added new cDbeginning-of-functioncA, cDend-of-functioncA,
      cDgoto-function-linecA and cDmark-function macroscA - thanks to Detlef.
    - [050223] Windows MS-dev 6 project - corrected project settings for
      cG_URLSUPPcA to cG_SOCKETcA in keeping with the socket dynamic library
      loading.
    - [050223] Added exec of wish to the tcl magic hook
    - [050223] Fixed ls$window-chars(5)lm$window-chars(5)le - added OSD default button chars.
    - [050222] Fixed ls$user-path(5)lm$user-path(5)le being more that 35 chars breaking 
      the lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le dialog.
    - [050222] Directory listing - call cGfhook-htmlcA when file is a` http://`
      file - this is never a directory listing.
    - [050222] Stopped loading of files in dir listing when clicking way
      to the right, must click on the name (MicroEmacs kept loading files
      when just trying to raise the window to the front - annoying).
    - [050222] If 0 given to lswatch(3)lmwatch(3)le call watch-time, this preserves the
      old interface.
    - [050222] Added backup file disabling for lsdos2unix(3f)lmdos2unix(3f)le macros via
      command line defineable variable.
    - [050221] Changed the new Windows process tree killing to use
      cGLoadLibrary()cA to detect whether the OS supports this feature (and NT
      does not). Also moved the URL support over to cGLoadLibrary()cA so we
      can remove the cD-ucA builds.
    - [050220] Added UNIX Shell and Makefile hilighting to lsnotes(3)lmnotes(3)le).
    - [050219] Fixed GNU GCC warnings in Makefiles for #pragma in X11
      files under Sun Solaris and uninitialized variables.
    - [050219] lsosd(2)lmosd(2)le. Removed dialog cCcGFcAcA flag as it was not documented,
      did not work and only used in one obscure place. Fixed cDC-gcA and cDDelcA
      so they close up to the previous dialog but does close the main menu
      down in one call - was annoying.
    - [050219] Release Candidate 1 - MicroEmacs 2005 (RC1)
    - [050218] Corrected UNIX lsClient-Server(2)lmclient-serverle socket file check -- bad test
      on existence of connection file, using wrong variable with wrong
      test sense.
    - [050218] Added site delete button to cDftp-connectcA dialog.
    - [050218] Fixed abbreviation and exec-string cGcG\\pcAcA and cGcG\\PcAcA store
      and goto position problem when the cGC-xcA cGC-acA or cGC-xcA a keys are
      rebound. Fixed by replacing with 'cDesccD cAxcD cAset-alpha-markcD cAPcA' (where
     cDesc-xcA is a safe internal special key).
    - [050218] Updated lswatch(3)lmwatch(3)le interface and made public. Created 
      new lswatch-time(3)lmwatch-time(3)le command and prompt user for watch type when no
      argument is given.
    - [050218] Removed the use of bit cG0x1000cA in Ada string hilight as this
      is unlikely to be wanted (probably copied from Pascal).
    - [050218] Changed the registry parser to abort on error rather than
      trying to carry on (a very painful process for a badly decrypted
      registry file).
    - [050218] Fixed highlighting minor issues. lshilight(2)lmhilight(2)le scheme now
      returns back to EOL scheme after a bracket. A branch tag on an EOL
      line removes the EOL flag so it hilights correctly. Branch tag now
      supports the cG0x1000cA single line hilight. Lookback now supports cG0x800cA
      on a branch tag.
    - [050217] HTML highlighting. Fixed some really grizzly scripted html
      page highlighting issues, predominantly with php.
    - [050217] Change ftp so it opens the cDftp-connectcA dialog if the
      current buffer is cG*ftp-files*cA.
    - [050217] Fixed ftp dir list column detection and highlighting issue
      with windows ftp servers (time given as cG9:15cA not cG09:15cA)
    - [050217] Fixed bug in lsset-variable(2)lmset-variable(2)le and lsunset-variable(2)lmunset-variable(2)le 
      when ls&sprintf(4)lm&sprintf(4)le is used to create a variable name.
    - [050217] Watch command (watch.emf). Improved the watch command, made
      'cG0cA cGwatchcA' call cDwatch-resetcA, changed cDwatch-resetcA so with an argument
      of cG0cA it removes all watches otherwise it resets the main watch
      counter and reports to the user which buffers are watched. Added new
      'cG2cA cGwatchcA' and cC`3 watch`cA which compares the file size, doing the
      following: cDa)cA file on disk is smaller than last watch - reloads
      whole file. cDb)cA file size is the same - does nothing. cDc)cA file on disk
      is larger - appends to the end of the buffer the tail of the file
      (cGfile_sizecA cG-cA cGwatch_file_sizecA bytes). This assumes that the files is
      always being appended (reasonable assumption in most cases. The only
      difference between 2 and 3 is that 2 forces a complete reread of the
      file on the first file change (ensuring the buffer is correct), 3
      does not which allows the user to trash the first gigabyte of the
      buffer before starting the watch.
    - [050217] Shell template - added local and function keywords and
      fixed a few string highlighting problems.
    - [050216] Made the dir-listing's (Filtered) label on line 2
      pick-able, changing the filter status when picked Made CVS's
      CVS-Quick label pick-able doing a full reread when picked.
    - [050216] Fixed a couple of silly register bugs introduced with
      last lsfind-registry(2)lmfind-registry(2)le concat root and sub-key change. Improved behavior
      when ftp erf file is missing, now create a new one in memory and
      flags as changed so should be saved on exit.
    - [050216] Do not abort cGme.emfcA execution if ftp erf file is missing or
      bad.
    - [050216] Fixed by removing the cCcGstartupcAcA function, the main init now
      uses dofile directly and it checks for either a NULL or cG""cA as a
      filname and replaces with "cDmecA" or ("cDnecA" and does not complain) if
      found to be empty. This means that give lsexecute-file(2)lmexecute-file(2)le an empty
      string executes either "cDmecA" or "cDnecA", i.e. resets me - nice side
      effect. Changed cCcGdofile()cAcA to cGexecFile()cA and changed cGexecFile()cA to
      cGexecuteFile()cA (as is function for command cDexecute-file(2)cA) and
      change the other exec command function names for consistency.
    - [050216] Fixed an annoyance reported by Bruno, ne should not
      complain if it fails to find cGne.emfcA - fair enough.
    - [050215] Fixed crash caused by using cG-ccA option with all files hidden
      (comment when browsing ftp dirs as cache dir lists are hidden) The
      startup process knows the history created buffers but the
      replacement was none of these and due to the toolbar it was a buffer
      without a file name and bang! Fixed in 2 ways, first check the
      replacement has a file name, second do not put hidden files into the
      history - they're hidden.
    - [050210] Improved movement between items using the cursor in the
      search dialog.
    - [050210] Fixed cvs dialog default settings.
    - [050210] Corrected search path expansion, incorrectly handling a
      cGPATH_CHARcA at the start of the string.
    - [050209] Up-dated lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le platform page to new style and
      added  lsyank-rectangle(2)lmyank-rectangle(2)le binding.
    - [050209] Fixed no-color termcap ls$window-chars(5)lm$window-chars(5)le variable setting
    - [050209] Fixed hot keys (were 3 'U's) in cGosdmisc.emfcA.
    - [050209] Added new cCBraceStatementcA lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le value to support GNU C
      indentation style.
    - [050209] Fixed the cGosdDisp()cA function required a cGTTflush()cA otherwise
      the cursor is left in the wrong position on termcap systems.
    - [050209] Fixed the default ls$window-chars(5)lm$window-chars(5)le variable setting.
    - [050209] Fixed the DOS home directory setting and compiler warnings.
    - [050208] Changed the C indent definition to be the same format as
      the existing indent definitions i.e. uses flag & indent value, this
      makes it more flexible and extendible. Updated macro files.
    - [050205] Password generation macros added to cGcontribcA directory.
    - [050205] Added JavaDoc highlighting to Java template. Enablement
      via lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le. Removed the existing cGcGmycAcA extensions from contrib.
    - [050205] Added cDDoxygen(1)cA, cC\<stdint.h\>cA and error highlighting to
      C/C++ templates. Enablement via lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le. Removed the
      existing cGcGmycAcA extensions from cGcontribcA.
    - [050204] osd - Fixed problems with the cCcursor shows current itemcA
      feature of osd caused by the cursor position going outside of the
      window.
    - [050202] Added an initial item number to the favorite and buffer
      menus.
    - [050203] Standardized narrow anchor and line flag movement behaviors
      with respect to deleting and inserting text. Enforced to effectively
      exist at character column -1 and been strict about maintaining a
      protected line. Made undo cope with markup lines that are lost.
      These changes may be a little to severe - we'll see.
    - [050202] Fixed cDC-gcA close osd dialog crash.
    - [050202] Directory listing - fixed nasty bug cause by the directory
      changing on disk before the hook has managed to do anything leading
      to a failure - this has been annoying Jon for some time!
    - [050127] cGhkemf.emfcA - Fixed cG!untilcA indent rule.
    - [050127] First revision of cDnotescA.
    - [050127] Fixed positional problems with mouse rectangle regions and
      added a mouse rectangle yank to user-setup.
    - [050127] cvs - Set the initial osd dialog item to be the first item
      rather than the Okay button (with is still the default button).
    - [050127] Fixed cG*scratch*cA hook assignment issues, initial startup
     buffer and only buffer delete problem.
    - [050127] Added process tree killing for windows, tested on win98, 2k
      & XP, would be good to test on win95 (which should work) and NT
      which should not work but hopefully will be no worse than current
      version.
    - This is a process tree killing for ipipes, in win32 killing the
      process we create is simply not good enough, all child processes
      continue unaffected. For example, run compile, kill the buffer in
      mid compile and it carries on behind your back!
    - For Unix we use a new group and kill the group, DOS does not support
      ipipe. We could have used the new Job concept in ME but this is only
      present in win2000 & XP and the binaries are unlikely to run on
      win98 etc. This should run on every win32 platform although it is
      unlikely to do anything positive on an NT box (works in win2k)
    - [050126] Changed the location of the cDfhook-defaultcA macro so its only
      defined if using cDbuffinitcA (i.e. if running main cGme.emfcA)
    - [050126] Fixed osd button repeat issue when current focus is an
      entry.
    - [050126] Changed cDinsert-file-namecA to insert buffer name if a -ve arg
      is given, bound to cDC-x ycA on the mode line, this replaces ml-lines
      cDesccA cDycA feature.
    - [050123] Fixed a crash caused by too many closed fences, the
      recursive nature of the cGfindfence()cA function triggers a stack crash
      at around 22000 on windows. Set limit to 256 nested fences.
    - [050122] Fixed lsdir(2m)lmdir(2m)le mode loss on a directory re-read, this caused
      a number of side effects including loss of highlighting and user
      prompt to reload the directory when it had changed.
    - [050119] Removed the "cCsub-keycA" argument from all registry related
      calls (see ls&reg(4)lm&reg(4)le and lsset-registry(2)lmset-registry(2)le). The registry calls used to
      comprise two arguments "cCrootcA" and "cCsub-keycA", the "cCsub-keycA" is really
      redundant and the same effect may be achieved by a simple string
      concatenation of the "cCsub-keycA" to the "cCrootcA".
    - [050119] Added cGcGmy-*hook-alwayscAcA macro checks in the buffer hook
      switching of lsbuffer-init(3)lmbuffer-init(3)le to permit global file hooks to be
      defined, this allows a file hook to operate on all buffers.
      cGcGmy-*hook-alwayscAcA is executed after the language file hooks of
      cGcG*hook-XXXcAcA and cGcGmy-*hook-XXXcAcA.
    - [050116] Added cGcGTODOcAcA highlighting rule for Makefile comments.
    - [050114] Fixed lsnarrow-buffer(2)lmnarrow-buffer(2)le type numeric argument not processed
      correctly.
    - [050113] Added tool bar tool mouse select region command.
    - [050113] Added bindings for the cvs and ftp console tools.
    - [050113] Fixed lsorganizer(3)lmorganizer(3)le duplicate index bug.
    - [050111] Deleted the cDget-registry(2)cA command, this has been
      depreciated and ls&reg(4)lm&reg(4)le should be used instead.
    - [050111] Extended the lsread-registry(2)lmread-registry(2)le and lssave-registry(2)lmsave-registry(2)le commands
      to permit reading and writing from a buffer based registry (rather
      than file).
    - [050111] Extended lslist-registry(2)lmlist-registry(2)le to permit listing of specific
      nodes, the output buffer of the registry listing may be specified.
      Added a invisible flag to a registry node which hides the node
      completely (but can be toggled).
    - [050111] Fixed windows server command file polling of up to 60 times
      a second by making the adder of the command responsible for 'waking'
      MicroEmacs by sending a cGWM_USERcA message. This is not a problem for
      UNIX as it is possible to wait on file input and cGEOFcA is not
      reported.
    - [050105] Fixed several narrow-to lsnarrow-buffer(2)lmnarrow-buffer(2)le usability issues,
      with these fixes the top and bottom narrow cannot be removed without
      a markup line and the order cannot get muddled.
    - [050105] Fixed a problem with the anchor position up-date when
      inserting a whole line.
    - [050105] Changed the osd entry mouse handling to always refocus,
      this allows the user to change location in the current entry using
      the mouse.
    - [050105] Fixed. lsinsert-macro(2)lminsert-macro(2)le undo location was incorrect causing
      a crash.
    - [050103] Spelling dialog. Changed the Ignore button to Continue if
      word becomes correct without changing (word added or language
      changed).
    - [050103] Fixed. CVS osd dialog with bad hot-key.
    - [050102] Added setting of ls$recent-keys(5)lm$recent-keys(5)le variable.
    - [041231] Variable cD$fmatchdelay(5)cA renamed to ls$pause-time(5)lm$pause-time(5)le.
      cC$pause-timecA is now used for other MicroEmacs delay times when the
      user is prompted for information.
    - [041224] Fixed several usability issues in the search replace
      dialog.
    - [041224] Up-graded printer-setup dialog to new style OSD.
    - [041224] CVS dialog - added read-only option to checkout and update.
    - [041224] Fixed lsgoto-line(2)lmgoto-line(2)le offset which as always going to the
      previous line (one out). cDucA [041221] Added support for proper kill
      buffer use in message line, i.e. lsset-mark(2)lmset-mark(2)le, lskill-region(2)lmkill-region(2)le,
      and  lscopy-region(2)lmcopy-region(2)le, lsyank(2)lmyank(2)le and lsreyank(2)lmreyank(2)le all work in the same way as a
      normal buffer.
    - [041221] Fixed registry node deletion when the node is modified.
    - [041221] Removed lsosd(2)lmosd(2)le cGosd 0cA 'cCdcA' flag and added 'cCIcA' initial item
      and 'cCDcA' default button flags, existing osd dialogs which use 'cCdcA'
      will fail to load and need are migrated to use the cCDcA and cCIcA flags.
    - [041218] lsauto-spell(3)lmauto-spell(3)le key bindings are promoted to global so its
      easy to enable in any buffer.
    - [041218] Corrected setting of the ls$home(5)lm$home(5)le environment variable to
      handle MS-Windows cCcG\\cAcAs, auto terminate with cCcG/cAcA.
    - [041210] Added Enable/Disable Auto-Spell to the context menu.
    - [041210] Rearranged the lsorganizer(3)lmorganizer(3)le dialog to be a little easier to
      navigate through.
    - [041210] Fixed nedit emulation insert binding.
    - [041210] Removed cDml-clear(2)cA command, replaced with lsml-write(2)lmml-write(2)le
      option cG`0 ml-write`cA.
    - [041210] Removed the cDchange-directory(2)cA command, a change in
      directory is achieved by changing the ls$buffer-fname(5)lm$buffer-fname(5)le value such
      that the path defines the location of the command. All macros
      operated relative to the buffer location and never explicitly
      changed the directory location.
    - [041210] Fixed CUA emulation insert binding.
    - [041210] Deleted cDletter(2m)cA mode. Use the default binding 
      of lsforward-delete-char(2)lmforward-delete-char(2)le for letter mode off, where single deleted
      characters are to be added to the kill buffer then the existing
      cDletter(2m)cA mode may be achieved by binding as "1
      forward-delete-char". Similarly for backspace,
      is lsbackward-delete-char(2)lmbackward-delete-char(2)le.
    - [041210] Deleted cDline(2m)cA mode. Use a binding with lskill-line(2)lmkill-line(2)le of
      cG`1 kill-line`cA to mimic the line mode enabled and cGcGkill-linecAcA for
      line mode disabled.
    - [041210] Deleted cDcmode(2m)cA. Electric-c is now configured 
      with lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le. C and C++ indent styles can be different, can also have a
      GNU C style etc, can change the indent width as new indent rule
      supports 'cCtcA', consistent ls$buffer-indent(5)lm$buffer-indent(5)le interface.
    - [041210] Created new osd file cGcGosdmisc.emfcAcA for miscellaneous OSD
      macros, this removes the OSD dependency when the MicroEmacs is
      executed in special start up modes with startup files. Moved search
      and new cDindent-setup(3)cA commands out of cGcGsearch.emfcAcA and
      cGcGformat.emfcAcA into a new cGcGosdmisc.emfcAcA as they cause problems with
      utils that do not run cGcGme.emfcAcA (e.g. cGcGehftools.emfcAcA)
    - [041210] Introduced a GNU emacs emulation mode, emulation file is
      cGcGmeemacs.emfcAcA.
    - [041209] Fixed cDnewusercA cGcG$user-name.emfcAcA conflict issue with an
      existing macro (e.g. cGzaurus.emfcA) by testing for it and prefixing a
      digit to make the file unique.
    - [041209] Added cGesc C-\cA binding to lsrestyle-buffer(3)lmrestyle-buffer(3)le.
    - [041209] Fixed some issues with the Tools user-setup dialog.
    - [041128] Added MinGW makefile posted to JASSPA group by Patrick
      Anderson, forms part of the release makefiles.
    - [041126] Added cCcGkcAcA keyboard setup to lsset-char-mask(2)lmset-char-mask(2)le which is used
      to translates foreign keys to a latin char.
    - [041126] Changed the internal LEADER byte to cG0x1ccA as cG0xffcA is a valid
      Russian char and it badly breaks cC$varscA and cCmacroscA.
    - [041126] Fixed spell dump word which was not translating the words
      to the users char-set.
    - [041126] Added support for Russian language.
    - [041126] Improved the aff ispell conversion routines (almost works
      automatically).
    - [041126] Stopped lsauto-spell(3)lmauto-spell(3)le from triggering the no dictionaries
      error, leave it to lsspell-buffer(3)lmspell-buffer(3)le etc.
    - [041125] Fixed OSD multi-line cGC-kcA cDkill-linecA behavior and implemented
      "cG-1cA cGkill-linecA" support.
    - [041125] Added basic support for Verilog programming language.
    - [041123] Fixed ftp OSD (auto entering entries broke the password
      field) and modernized.
    - [041028] Fixed. cG*find*cA buffer exhibits the same behavior as cG*grep*cA
      buffer. i.e. the cG*find*cA buffer remains on screen and a pop-up window
      is used to show the file.
    - [041028] Fixed. cG*grep*cA buffer does not load file when selected 
      with cG\<RETURN\>cA.
    - [041027] Spruced up old cGcGapache.confcAcA highlighting rules and added
      to release.
    - [041022] Fixed very obscure cvs load-up bug.
    - [041122] Updated schemes to set 'cCShow cursor in osdcA' suitably and to
      make sure the cursor is not red as this conflicts with the match
      fence display.
    - [041120] Fixed lstranspose-lines(2)lmtranspose-lines(2)le crash when lsundo(2m)lmundo(2m)le mode is
      disabled.
    - [041120] Removed the OSD explicit tab order value as this was not
      constructively used and causes many item order problems.
    - [041119] Many improvements to OSD dialog user interface following
      suggestions for news group. Updated most of the osd dialogs to use
      the new cG[*]cA check-box chars. Fixed tabbing orders and moved some
      items over to combo-boxes. Added osd-cursor visibility support to
      scheme-edit. Made the displaying of the cursor in an osd dialog
      a ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le bit set by the highlight scheme and fixed the position
      when in a child dialog.
    - [041118] Added a macro recursion depth limit of 20 to avoid blowing
      up MicroEmacs when the user has created an infinitely recursive
      macro.
    - [041112] Added Paul Boekholt's suggested GNU Emacs key bindings.
    - [041107] lskill-paragraph(2)lmkill-paragraph(2)le, lsfill-paragraph(2)lmfill-paragraph(2)le, lsforward-paragraph(2)lmforward-paragraph(2)le
      and lsbackward-paragraph(2)lmbackward-paragraph(2)le commands redefined. cDkill-paragraphcA now
      kills forward and backward rather than control the kill buffer.
      Paragraph movement now defined blank-line to blank-line rather than
      the first/last paragraph line.
    - [041105] Fixed lskill-line(2)lmkill-line(2)le, lsforward-kill-word(2)lmforward-kill-word(2)le 
      and lsbackward-kill-word(2)lmbackward-kill-word(2)le numerical argument implementation.
    - [041104] Removed cDregex-forward(3)cA and cDregex-backward(3)cA macros and
      moved uses of them over to lssearch-buffer(2)lmsearch-buffer(2)le.
    - [041104] Added lssearch-buffer(2)lmsearch-buffer(2)le command which replaces the macro
      commands cDregex-forward(3)cA and cDregex-backward(3)cA. Simplifies macro
      processing of searching by providing a search that explicitly sets
      the lsexact(2m)lmexact(2m)le and lsmagic(2m)lmmagic(2m)le modes. The default is to respect buffers
      exact and magic mode and flags must have cGEcA or cGMcA to ensure they are
      disabled.
    - [041104] Changed any use of lskill-line(2)lmkill-line(2)le to "cG1cA cGkill-linecA" as this
      should maintain its required behavior. A cDkill-linecA with no numeric
      argument kills to the end of the line but excludes the end of line
      character (GNU Emacs compatibility). The default binding is the "cG1cA
      cGkill-linecA" form, re-bind the key to cGcGkill-linecAcA if the end of line
      is not to be killed.
    - [041104] Removed cDline(2m)cA and cDletter(2m)cA buffer modes as these can
      be done using numerical arguments to bindings. See 
      the lskill-line(2)lmkill-line(2)le binding which replaces cClinecA mode. 
      See lsforward-delete-char(2)lmforward-delete-char(2)le and lsbackward-delete-char(2)lmbackward-delete-char(2)le binding which
      replaces cClettercA mode.
    - [041104] Changed the lsforward-kill-word(2)lmforward-kill-word(2)le and lsbackward-kill-word(2)lmbackward-kill-word(2)le
      commands to be more consistent with GNU Emacs.
    - [041102] Moved winterm over to using cGaddKeyToBufferOnce()cA for mouse
      move and time, also done same for UNIX mouse time event. This
      minimizes the number of mouse moved events that are processed by the
      system.
    - [041101] MS Windows. Fixed mouse cursor disappearing after using a
      cCShiftcA or cCControlcA mouse button event.
    - [041101] Auto reload the directory even if it is changed
      (cGhkdirlst.emfcA).
    - [041030] MS-Windows. Removed the cGcGWM_INPUTLANGCHANGEcAcA message
      handler as this did the wrong thing (use cGAlt-ShiftcA to change between
      two different keyboards e.g. US and Russian)
    - [041030] MS-Windows. Changed the method used to get the APPDATA path
      to use cGSHGetSpecialFolderLocation()cA as this is available in all
      versions of Windows.
    - [041030] UNIX. Fixed the mouse movement which caused a rendering
      anomaly. Mouse moved commands are only added to the key buffer if
      the key is not already present in the key queue. This alleviates a
      large build up of redundant mouse move keys on the queue. (Added
      function cGaddKeyToBufferOnce()cA),
    - [041030] Added mouse rectangle region selection methods,
      so lscopy-rectangle(3)lmcopy-rectangle(3)le and lskill-rectangle(2)lmkill-rectangle(2)le.
    - [041029] Hardened lscpp(9)lmcpp(9)le C++ commenting on cG//cA alignment when the
      previous line is a solid cG//////////cA when re-styling buffer.
    - [041029] Fixed lsfind(3)lmfind(3)le cGcG*find*cAcA buffer operation so that it operates
      like cGcG*grep*cAcA on file selection. Keyboard file section enabled
      within the cGcG*grep*cAcA and cGcG*find*cAcA buffer.
    - [041026] Spruced up old cGcGsmb.confcAcA highlighting rules, brought them
      up to date with latest keywords and added to release.
    - [041026] Fixed cDindent-setup(3)cA osd dialog.
    - [041024] Macro/source compatibility macro and source versions
      updated to cGcG20041001cAcA.
    - [041024] Fixed the lscvs-diff(3)lmcvs-diff(3)le options, local with HEAD was not
      correct.
    - [041024] lslatex(9)lmlatex(9)le template extended. Buffer bindings for underscore
      and quote keys. Search tools to determine current context.
    - [041023] Extended the buffer setup for the lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le mechanism. May
      now specify the default buffer cCindent-widthcAand cCtabsizecA in 
      the lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le dialog.
    - [041022] Revised indentation implementation. The templates now
      define indent width independent rules. The lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le command
      'cCindentcA' parameter may be defined as an absolute indentation or
      using a cCcGtcAcA notation. The syntax is cGcG[-][[indent][/indent]]tcAcA which
      defines a vulgar fraction of cCcGtcAcA which is the indent width (or
      tabsize) as specified by ls$buffer-indent-width(5)lm$buffer-indent-width(5)le defined below.
    - The global variables cD$tabsize(5)cA renamed ls$indent-width(5)lm$indent-width(5)le and
      controls the global indentation size. cD$tabwidth(5)cA 
      renamed ls$tab-width(5)lm$tab-width(5)le and controls the display size of a literal TAB
      character.
    - The indentation is now specified on a buffer basis, the 
      variables ls$buffer-indent-width(5)lm$buffer-indent-width(5)le and ls$buffer-tab-width(5)lm$buffer-tab-width(5)le define the
      indentation and TAB width on a per buffer basis. These are seeded
      from the aforementioned global variables.
    - [041022] Fixed spelling mistake in user interface of XML macros.
    - [041022] Removed CVS cGcGLog:cAcA field from all of the template files -
      undesirable.
    - [041022] Added HTTP highlighting to the text document template.
    - [041021] Enhanced Wiki language template.
    - [041021] Added Windows CUA emulation mode.
    - [041019] Fixed insert binding for Nedit emulation mode
    - [041019] Fixed lsperl(9)lmperl(9)le highlighting rules. Using incorrect syntax.
    - [041016] Fixed UNIX make files for building NE in debug mode.
    - [041016] Fixed termcap entry for cD^@cA key (cGC-spacecA). (Thanks to Bob
      Paddock for noting ommission)
    - [041016] Added cDM-%cA binding to lsquery-replace-string(2)lmquery-replace-string(2)le as built in
      binding. (Thanks to Bob Paddock)
    - [041016] Added Ruby programming language support.
    - [041015] Corrected problem with directory listing loosing
      highlighting (a ls@mna(4)lm@mna(4)le problem).
    - [041014] Within OSD, fixed spelling mistake. cCLoosecA -> cCLosecA.
    - [041014] Fixed lsdelete-hilight-lines(3)lmdelete-hilight-lines(3)le failure when buffer file has
      changed.
    - [041009] Fixed osd entry scheme as the cursor was not visible in MS
      Dev-Studio Colors.
    - [041009] Added Wiki language template
    - [041003] Wheel mouse binding added as default.
    - [041003] Catch long lines from cut and paste, resolve crash.
    - [041002] Added X-Windows drag and drop support using cDxdndcA.
    - [040930] Added HTML, XML and SGML close bracket auto expansion.
    - [040930] Added XML and HTML verification macro. Added XML utilities
      macros to allow next and previous tag to be matched. The XML
      utilities are also used by SGML.
    - [040930] Added cGxxxx-pre-expand-abbrevcA hook so that macros may add
      their own expansion methods.
    - [040917] Added cG\<...\>cA as supported fences.
    - [040917] Fixed the cG-1cA lsadd-next-line(2)lmadd-next-line(2)le ignore line feature.
    - [040915] lscvs-add(3)lmcvs-add(3)le looks for a Tags file in the CVS directory and
      sets the GUI state appropriately. Added server to the lscvs-state(3)lmcvs-state(3)le
      line mangling.
    - [040909] lscvs(3)lmcvs(3)le GUI updated with new features. Added repository set
      up to the UI. Reduced wait time on long commands by using ipipe.
      Allowed cG-zcA option to be used with ls%cvs-com(5)lm%cvs-com(5)le.
    - [040828] lsabout(2)lmAboutle page includes the century in the date (suggested by Th).
    - [040824] Fix for man page hyper-link when includes cG-/./_cA characters.

    - [040326] Introduction of UPX on Windows and DOS executables for cDnecA
      only.
    - [040326] Support for MS-DOS long name under DJGPP v2.0. For version
      2.0 then the DJGPP functions must be invoked rather than the MS-DOS
      BIOS calls otherwise the modified short name is returned. DJGPP v1
      is still supported original definitions maintained.
    - [040326] Added lsfiletype(3f)lmfiletype(3f)le macro to determine the file type of
      MS-DOS, Windows or UNIX.
    - [040322] cC$mousecA variables configured under console modes to allow
      pseudo mouse operations to be performed.
    - [040322] Fixed the cDwin32scA build and emain.h definitions. Mouse was
      not supported under cCwin32scA through incorrect configuration
      definition.
    - [040322] Key bindings for the file browser. cGENTERcA now handled on the
      reserved fields to sort. cGBACKSPACEcA now moves up a directory level.
    - [040322] Changed the interface to cDcvscA, cDftpcA and cDfile-browsercA command
      so that if a numeric argument of cG0cA is given then the directory tree
      window is not opened, just the cG*files*cA buffer.

    - [040310] Support for multiple comment styles in the same language
      template. Additional comment styles are defined in the cGcGhkXXX.emfcAcA
      file with the syntax cGcG.fhook-XXX.comment-NcAcA where cGcGNcAcA is an integer
      starting for cC1cA to cCncA, the number of different comment styles.
      Templates updated to use multiple comment styles where appropriate
      (C, C++ and SQL).
    - [040310] Support the 'cCrcA' flag in cGcG.fhook-XXX.commentcAcA flag field.
      Causes the key binding to cGcGesc-ocAcA and cGcGesc-qcAcA to restyle the
      comment. All templates updated to include the flag where
      appropriate.
    - [040310] lscvs(3)lmcvs(3)le operates asynchronously using ipipes. Refresh
      problems resolved.
    - [040310] lsnarrow-search-forward(3)lmnarrow-search-forward(3)le bound to cG`C-c s`cA,
      and lsnarrow-search-backward(3)lmnarrow-search-backward(3)le bound to cG`C-c r`cA.
    - [040308] lsipipe-shell-command(2)lmipipe-shell-command(2)le includes additional flag to run in
      "cCraw modecA" where the buffer is not annotated and wrap is disabled.
      Additional argument added to command to allow the ls$buffer-ipipe(5)lm$buffer-ipipe(5)le
      macro to be defined when the pipe is defined. Corrected operation
      of lspipe-shell-command(2)lmpipe-shell-command(2)le where cCipipecA automatically degrades to a cCpipecA
      (Windows only), if degraded then the ls$buffer-ipipe(5)lm$buffer-ipipe(5)le macro is still
      invoked on completion.
    - [040226] Deleted cGcGcygnus.emfcAcA added cGcGcygwin.emfcAcA for lscygwin(3)lmcygwin(3)le BASH

      breaks   lsauto-spell(3)lmauto-spell(3)le   until   a   main   spell   command   ,   lsspell-word(3)lmspell-word(3)le 
      or  lsspell-buffer(3)lmspell-buffer(3)le is executed.
    - [040223] lscvs(3)lmcvs(3)le directory listing file loss solved. Differences
      between CVS command line operations and directory list operations

      menus. Created new context-menu command, bound to cGS-f1cA and the
      windows 'menu' key (aka windows) and created binds to open main menu
     (cDesc =cA) and context menu (cDesc +cA) on termcap platforms.
    - [040217] Fixed. cD2cA lspopup-window(2)lmpopup-window(2)le does not work on an XTerm, no
      implementation in function cGmeFrameXTermMakeCurcA.
    - [040217] Fixed. CVS status of directories is not shown. Also add cCcGbcAcA
      and cCcGocAcA file type flags.
    - [040216] Fixed. ME cDbuild.bat -lcA options do not work in standard
      cmd/command as there use 4DOS cCcG>>&cAcA extension. Changed to using cG2>&1cA
      which works on cmd & 4nt but breaks 4Dos and command.
    - [040216] Fixed bottom Toolbar window grows when CVS is opened,
      then lschange-window-depth(2)lmchange-window-depth(2)le does not respect bit 2 of ls$window-flags(5)lm$window-flags(5)le.

      easily seen from a small window.
    - [040213] PHP script can be started with cCcG\<?cAcA tag in a php file.
    - [040213] Corrected UNIX ishell operation when "cDsucA" to another user.
      Locking up or generally behaving badly (termio not initialized).
      Affects all UNIX platforms.
    - [040213] Documented the create/delete/next-frame keys.
    - [040210] Fixed toolbar Directory File List does not contain cGcG../cAcA -
      UNIX only.
    - [040210] Fixed. On UNIX only the ls$progname(5)lm$progname(5)le may not be fully
      expanded (has just "me") which may lead to a ctags generation error
      and an alternate fix to ls$search-path(5)lm$search-path(5)le.
    - [040210] Fixed. On UNIX, lsfind-file(2)lmfind-file(2)le of a symbolic link which
      points to a directory results in a bad dir listing. The list of
      files is correct but the statistics are all wrong (found on SunOS 5.8).
    - [040210] Fix subtle ftp bug with alias ftp addressed. Create an ftp
      site cGcGftp://test/cAcA say with user name foo and password bar and then
      load in cGcGftp://test/dir1/cAcA the buffer file name is correctly set as
      cGcGftp://test/dir1/cAcA but the 'Directory listing of:' line is set to
      cGcGftp://foo@test/dir1/cAcA. Firstly the user may wish the 'cCfoocA' to be
      hidden but secondly with the introduction of being able to click on
      the 'cCDirectorycA cClisting of:cA' line this has introduced a subtle
      inefficiency/bug, if I click on the cCcGfoo@testcAcA ME will load
      cGcGftp://foo@test/cAcA not cGcGftp://test/cAcA which to ME is a completely
      different file. This can in turn lead to cGcGftp://foo@test/dir1/cAcA
      being loaded so you can end up with 2 copies of every dir being
      loaded! The fix is to make the 'cCDirectory listing of:cA' line the
      same, i.e. cGcGftp://test/dir1/cAcA
    - [040208] Fixed. "cD-ncA" command line option to a console build causes a
      option failure and the executable does not run.
    - [040208] Corrected UNIX jasspa tree search when executable is in CWD
      and there is no executable path.
    - [040206] cDRC4 - Release Candidate 4 - MicroEmacs '04cA

    - [040203] "cCuser-setupcA" changed name to "cCRebind Home KeyscA" for
      re-binding of cGhomecA and cGendcA keys to start/end of line. Removed cGcGC-vcAcA
      binding that existed with old "cCMS keys" labelcA.
    - [040203] Reworked all user defined defined directory save locations,
      ftp, spell, etc..
    - [040203] Corrected osf1, openBSD and zaraus emf files.
    - [040203] Added ls%cvs-com(5)lm%cvs-com(5)le variable to define the CVS command.
    - [040203] XML template extended to include javascript.
    - [040130] 2nd iteration of prototype and near final revision of new
      user setup.
    - Following an internal review of RC3 then it has been decided to
      address the issues of user configuration prior to a full release.
      This specifically addresses the location of user MicroEmacs
      configuration directories and search paths. User configuration has
      traditionally required the setting of external environment variables
      such as "$MEPATH" and for the user to create a private directory to
      store user settings. This is proving difficult for new users who
      just want to run the editor. RC4 and subsequent releases will
      address these problems by determining the correct location for
      configuration files and create the appropriate files and directories
      under user control.
    - The net result of these changes should significantly simplify
      installation and setup as follows:
    - All platforms will be able to run without any manual user setup or
      the requirement for specific MicroEmacs environment variables.
    - User defined directories and configuration files will be created
      under editor control on detecting a new user.
    - Existing installations using cG$MEPATHcA will be backwards compatible
      with the new build.
    - All platforms now support a searching jasspa sub-directory structure
      of cDcompanycA / cDspellingcA / cDmacroscA. This was traditionally limited to
      the Windows Install Shield installation but has been extended across
      all platforms.
    - Two new environment variables are provided for user or system
      administrator use. ls$MEINSTALLPATH(5)lm$MEINSTALLPATH(5)le defines the location of the
      MicroEmacs standard macros and allows the built in search path to be
      overridden. ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le defines the location of the user private
      configuration directory and allows the user to locate their private
      directory in different location. In a standard install neither of
      these variables will be required.
    - The Microsoft Windows system defined application path will be used
      for user configuration files. This is applicable for roaming users
      where the application directory is stored on a server.
    - The use of the lsme32.ini(8)lmme32.ini(8)le file on MicroSoft Windows environments is
      not required, but is still supported.
    - The UNIX path searching is improved. cG/usr/local/microemacscA will be
      depreciated and replaced with cG/usr/local/jasspacA in addition other
      standard path locations are supported on a per-platform basis.
    - On UNIX then the directory cG~/.jasspacA shall contain the user
      configuration files. Optionally the cDcompanycA, cDspellingcA and cDmacroscA
      sub-directories may be included in this directory where access to
      the system directory locations by the user is not permitted.
    - Concept of guest has been removed. cGguest.emfcA and cGguest.erfcA removed
      replaced with cCnewusercA. lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le no longer supports setting of
      name.
    - Internal variables ls$user-name(5)lm$user-name(5)le and ls$user-path(5)lm$user-path(5)le are defined.
    - [040128] Fixed re-style for C/C++ comments in vertical alignment.
    - [040123] "cCuser-setupcA" mouse button selection fixed.
    - [040123] cGC-x 3cA mapped to lssplit-window-horizontally(2)lmsplit-window-horizontally(2)le, cGC-x 5cA mapped

      indent operates correctly following a fold.

      for each tool.
    - [030917] Changed the CHAR defines and add defines for the LEADER and
      TRAIL bytes used for special chars. Re-implemented OSD hot-keys to
      use "cD\\HcA" instead of "cD&cA" and added new "cD\\{cA" and "cD\\}cA" to stop and
      start current item hilighting. Added support for C++ private public
      and protected token indentation. Added new Check-box chars to the
      extended chars (1,2,3,4,19 & 20) and improved the drawing of some of

      the calls to "meGetUserKey" to "meGetKey" so a macro can give a list
      of keys Added new 0 argument which quits at the EOB rather than
      going to the top of the buffer etc (used in lspage-file(3)lmpage-file(3)le "isearch").
    - [030710] Changed the logic of the 'cCcCdcAcA' flag so that it disables the
      displaying of the item type, changed button rendering so that it
      adheres to this so a single char button can be created Added new 'cCcCOcAcA'
      combo box item type which is a mixture between an entry box and a
      sub-menu item.
    - [030710] Improved the special char drawing routines so that they
      remain inside the char space and triangles look good regardless of
      size.
    - [030710] Fixed a nasty bug to do with file hooks that load other
      files and the find-file command manipulating the buffHistNo
      incorrectly so the wrong buffer is shown - obscure!
    - [030625] Added macro release makefile.
    - [030625] MicroEmacs 3.8 compatibility. Fixed isearch emulation.

      just moving the file first.
    - [030608] Changed the addLine function so it always flags the line as
      changed, this avoids some bizarre issues when macros delete an
      insert lines of text (best shown by the buffer-info tool-bar tool).

      variable ls$result(5)lm$result(5)le setting to help in determining this.
    - [030514] Folding. Changed the fold-setup so a setup string can be
      passed in rather than searching for one in the buffer, aimed at
      utilizing the new buffer-fhook ls$result(5)lm$result(5)le setting.
    - [030514] Set ls$result(5)lm$result(5)le to the magic fhook string so the fhook macro
      does not have to search for it again in buffer.c.

      fold-open.
    - [030512] Fixed display matching fence issue with poke screen hiding
      the cursor on Unix X-Windows. May need to be done on MS-DOS as well.
    - [030512] Fixed horrid crash caused in search.c by buffer change in
      macro followed by query replace and toolbar up-date changing the
      regex variables.

    - [030512] Ipipe fix for SunOS.
    - [030512] Changedthe line flag implementation to be more flexible and
      variable in size so UE has a smaller memory usage and ME has line
      flags available.
    - [030512] Improvedthe AMark setting and deleting.
    - [030512] Added a Protected Line flag and vastly improved the
      narrowing. Renamed most function in cGline.ccA to make them more
      readable.
    - [030512] Big return value change to get functions consistent - found
      that the return values of low level line functions where different
      to high level functions making the code hard to read and dangerous.
      Also needed a consistent triple value return (true false and error)
      so change cGmeABORTcA to -1 across the board.

      (thats been annoying me for some time).
    - [011220] Moved the template etfinsrt calls into the
      buffer-initialize macro.
    - [011220] Fixed the exec fhook-cpp not working .
    - [011220] Fixes to ctags for C++ function call initializers.
    - [011220] Fixed Windows Console \<RETURN\> key keyboard mapping,
      returning incorrect binding.

    - [011219] Fixed Termcap tparm() to use a default stack argument if
      not specified by default.

      replace-string "\n" "").
    - [011029] hklatex.emf item-list support (hit "f7").
    - [011028] hklatex.emf has a greatly improved pseudo highlighting.
    - [011028] Tweaked the "@fs" variable to improve its usability.

    - [011028] Fixes to windows file times.
    - [011016] New caps-lock, num-lock, scroll-lock and pause key support
      for win32 & unix. The "*-lock" implementation to be more like
      "S-pick" and "C-pick" as the keys are automatically supported (like
      the shift) so there are no default binds to void, the keys are only
      generated if there are bound. Could not implement this on MS-DOS.
    - [011016] which command built in i.e. "M-x which". Used for command
      utilities.

    - [011025] Utilized the latest screen-update improvements to make the
      gdiff screen update rock solid.
    - [011025] mlGetChar fix. The key "return" was the 78th special char,
      i.e. "SKEY_SPEC"|'N' and as the mlGetChar did not check the
      "SKEY_SPEC" bits, pressing return was like pressing 'N' so on a
      "Y/N" prompt try pressing return, its like saying No! .
    - [011016] Spelling dictionaries renamed with ISO naming scheme.
      Because of the language changes, you need to rename your personal
      dictionary to lsdpengb.edf for British and lsdpenus.edf for
      American.
    - [011016] Highlighting brackets/braces as requested from user base.
      The highlight braces required some other subtle changes to
      screen-update and show-region and the addition of the "rbin" mode
      means that this version is incompatible with the last in quite a few
      areas.
    - [011016] Fixed mouse handler (turns out that if the pick event was
      lost (use "@cg" or an error) then me would lock!).
    - [011016] Extended control on indent tab and return behavior (can
      disable the tab behavior).
    - [011016] C++ name space indentation support.
    - [011016] New language support interface so spelling is not required
      for a language to be supported (may only want the basic alphabet
      setup etc).
    - [011016] Changed file loading interface so all commands (like
      view-file) can load in "bin", "crypt" or "rbin" mode.
    - [010123] Reduced binary mode added (rbin).

      fixed several bugs when running with a CVS server. Also added
      support for the CVS/Template file when committing.
    - [010716] Minor update to the CVS help page for the aforementioned
      (Affected all help files).

    cD3rd Release - July 2001cA

    - [010713] New style WWW JASSPA Pages.
    - [010712] Added comment and menu support for MS-DOS and M4
      (hkdos.emf/hkm4.emf).

      (cbox.emf/me.ehf).
    - [010710] Added a 'Plain Text' char set which only uses plain letters
      (charset.emf).
    - [010710] Fixed many little comment formatting bugs and annoyances

      reformatting of comments now used by most of the file hooks.
    - [010412] Added new generic buffer setup, menu and help macros,
      creating the new lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le command. Ported all existing file
      hooks to this new interface greatly reducing the buffer hook size
      while increasing its functionality and consistency.
    - [010402] Added support for new ls$buffer-backup(5)lm$buffer-backup(5)le variable for
      setting the back-up file location.
    - [010312] Support for new key bindings allowing CU emulations. Nedit
      bindings provided as example. Major work to enable the complete
      re-binding of all keys so the user interface to MicroEmacs can be
      completely changed, this allows for example a Windows feel to be
      created. This required many internal ghosts to be exorcized and add
      new macro functions.
    - [010308] User buffer configuration menu added.
    - [010308] Improved Python support (Contribution PG).

      for user dependent completion, used in "gdiff".
    - [010202] Changed buffer variables to except the form
      cGcG:\<buffer-name\>:\<variable\>cAcA, like command variables. This allows
      macros to access variable not defined in the current buffer.
    - [010126] File "autosave" location changes. Control save name and
      location.
    - [001005] OSD speedups.
    - [001005] Improved and increased the file system operations via the
      new lsfile-op(2)lmfile-op(2)le command, created better menus in the lsfile-browser(3)lmfile-browser(3)le.
    - [001010] Revamped the main ftp GUI to make it work much more
      rationally.
    - [001010] Improved lsipipe-shell-command(2)lmipipe-shell-command(2)le efficiency on Windows by
      introducing a new thread approach to listen for activity.
      Implemented a shell command-line in an ipiped environment
      so lsishell(3)lmishell(3)le command is now usable on Windows platforms.
    - [001010] Added new lsset-position(2)lmset-position(2)le which can be used to store all
      information about the current window and lsgoto-position(2)lmgoto-position(2)le which will
      then restore them. Allowed macros to use non-letter characters for
      alpha marks and positions so they no longer need to clobber user
      ones.
    - [001010] Added new "-k" and "-u" command-line options and improved
      "-s" option.
    - [000922] Added GUI for tag dialogue for tags generation.
    - [000922] Recursive tags support (i.e. nested directory tag
      traversal).
    - [000810] emain.h "#define"'s properly supported again so MicroEmacs
      can be successfully compiled without options like SPELL and OSD etc.
      This can reduce the binary size by up to 37%.
    - [000718] Source trees now maintained under CVS.
    - [000719] Improved TCL/TK and Perl template support.
    - [000704] Improved FTP and HTTP support.
    - [000620] Java tags support.
    - [000503] Revised printer support.

      text directory.
    - [000322] Minor modifications to support Borland 5.5 compiler
      (win32b55.mak).
    - [000322] Support for Openstep 4.2 / NeXT Motorola 040 (Termcap

    - [000322] New font rendering, supporting bold, italic, underline etc.
      All platforms modified to cope with font scheme definitions.
      Platforms optimized for speed.
    - [000126] Beta build revision contains version information for
      2000/01/26.
    - [000126] Directory file copy. Within this release files in the
      directory listings may be selected for copy and pasting from the
      menu. Use the right mouse button to pop-up a menu in the directory
      buffers. Copy and paste to/from a ftp directory buffer to a local
      drive buffer may be used to initiate an ftp transfer. (This is how
      these pages are uploaded).
    - [000126] New command ftp opens a ftp connection using a dialog. Use
      may save the host connection information in a registry file. Note
      that the password information is exposed so be careful where this is
      used - if in doubt do not enter the password and you will be
      prompted.
    - [000126] New command lsuniq(3)lmuniq(3)le operates as the UNIX of the same name.
      used with sort, and reduces to unique lines.
    - [000126] Character translation; addition of character translation
      macros when moving between character sets. Accessible from Menu ->
      Format -> Change Buffer Char Set.
    - [000126] Support for additional character sets, Windows GREEK,
      Windows TURKISH.
    - [000126] Line highlighting selection with the use of the mouse and
      auto search. When using the mouse selection to set up the line
      highlighting when invoked from a right-mouse -> Hilight Line ->
      color/remove selection; the macro determines the mouse selected
      region and makes an appropriate decision as to how the line
      highlighting scheme is to be applied. The following rules apply to
      the mouse selection:-
       - Point in line selected (i.e. mark == point) Highlight the line only.
       - Region in the line selected. Both point and mark are on the same
            line. Extract the selected text and hilight all lines that match
            the search pattern. The color "remove" is also pattern matched
            to selectively remove lines.
       - Region selected mark & point on different lines Block up the
            region with appropriate highlight.
       - Note that line highlighting may be safely used in a folded
            buffer.
       - [000126] Addition of special rendered space character. You may
            toggle this from the keyboard using a macro in your user.emf as
            follows:-

              ; Macro to enable the display of TAB/CR. Note that we
              ; force the screen to be updated.
              define-macro tab-display
              set-variable $system &bxor $system 0x80000
              screen-update
              !emacro
              global-bind-key "tab-display" "f11"

    - [000126] Documentation update on new features (contained in me.ehf).
    - [000114] Fixed font selection bug in 000112 beta.
    - [000112] Revised color hilighting schemes, reduced the number of
      colors in a number of schemes. Introduction of the Sherwood Forest
      color scheme (green theme obviously !!).
    - [000112] Small revision to the user interface with respect to font
      selection. In order to make character set selection easier then the
      multiple choices for the box characters have been removed from Menu
      -> Help -> User Setup. These have been replaced with a new check box
      Extended Char Set. This box should be checked to enable the special
      rendering characters and enable the box characters - this is
      typically enabled on X-Windows and MS-Windows.
    - [000112] Provision for directory list sorting on name, modification
      time and size. Selecting the directory column title performs a
      re-sort based on the selection, a further selection reverses the
      order of the list.
    - [000112] Addition of ftp support (meu build on Windows, enabled by
      default on UNIX). Enables files to be edited via ftp, (read and
      write supported). Transfer to another system using
      ftp://[\<user\>[:\<password]@]\>\<host\>[:\<port\>]/\<pathname\>.
    - [000112] Improved source code provision for foreign languages,
      various internal problems. Support for Russian (Windows and Cyrillic
      koi8-r).
    - [000112] Y2K problems with time stamping and mode line date.
    - [000112] New spelling rules for number sequences and specialized
      wild card sequences. Within the rule file (i.e. americar.emf,
      britishr.emf, etc.) then the following spelling rules may be added
      to cope with numeric sequences. The addition of these rules will
      spell check hexadecimal sequences and validate numeric sequences
      such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc. A spelling of "1nd" would generate a
      spelling error. This has not been performed for other languages so
      submissions for other language equivalents would be appreciated.

              ; Add some special word rules to make life easier.
              ; These are for 1st, 2nd 3rd etc.
              add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?1\\(st\\|ST\\)"
              add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?2\\(nd\\|ND\\)"
              add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?3\\(rd\\|RD\\)"
              add-spell-rule "*" "[0-9]*1[0-9]\\(th\\|TH\\)"

              \\|Mb\\|mm\\|cm\\|m\\|Km\\|ft\\|inch\\|mph\\|lb\\|am\\|pm\\)"

    - [000112] Box selection copy and paste. Bindings are defined as `Esc C-w`
      for lskill-rectangle(2)lmkill-rectangle(2)le cGEsc C-ycA lsyank-rectangle(2)lmyank-rectangle(2)le.
    - [000112] Enhanced info file hilighting (Thanks to Dr. Detlef Groth
      for this).
    - [000112] New copy-file command, typically used by the macro language
      for moving files around.
    - [000112] Error reporting of bad command line arguments in Microsoft
      Windows environment (Thanks to Pedro Gomes for this).

    cD2nd Release - November 1999cA

    - [991101] Enhanced the latex support macros following various
      contributions from users.
    - [991101] Added Favorites to the File pull down menu. This is a
      simple mechanism to allow the user to add a file to a favorites
      list.
    - [991101] Ground up implementation of the regular expression pattern
      matcher, following licensing problems with the GNU regex. The
      resultant pattern matcher is now a little faster than GNU regex and
      is capable of all of the standard regular expression pattern
      matches. The pattern matcher has diverged from GNU in that double
      backslashes are required in the character classes [..] to allow for
      escape sequence short cuts such as '\n' (newline), '\t' (tab) etc.
      It was felt that this compromise was better than having to quote the
      more obscure search characters.
    - [991101] Changed the hilighting and indenting syntax to be GNU regex
      compliant.
    - [991101] Modified compare-windows to ignore white space by default,
      compare-windows-exact performs an exact character for character
      comparison.
    - [991101] Enhanced the tags support to handle multiple tags and
      recursive directory tree searching.
    - [991101] Implemented osd-help, a gui front end to the on-line help.
      Required changes to the help system which gives macros access to the
      on-line help buffer, needed for the index and search.
    - [991101] Over-hauled the highlighting scheme files and editor to
      support the disabling of buffer highlighting.
    - [991101] Many bugs fixed on all platforms, in particular unix
      cutting and pasting (crashes exceed) and focus problems and NT exit
      delay.
    - [991101] Added tab and newline character printing in buffers.
    - [991101] Introduced message line variables "@mx" and "@mxa".
    - [991101] New Games - Crossword cracker. The ideal way to cheat at
      crosswords. Uses the spelling dictionary to guess at the word, given
      a number of known letters.
    - [991101] Hook file protection against globally bound keys - prevents
      re-binding of user defined keys within the macro.
    - [991101] Search/Replace fix for exact mode. Environment variable
      search path fix.
    - [991101] hkm4.emf added back into the release (seemed to have gone
      missing).
    - [991101] Cut and paste fix when running the UNIX version through an
      X-Server such as Exceed in the Windows environment.
    - [991101] Plain text printer device added.
    - [991101] Obscure OSD fix.
    - [991101] New OSD help search facility Menu->Help->General Help.
    - [991101] Fix for NT hang-up on shut down (typically encountered when
      running a source debugger).
    - [991101] Fix for NT process spawning with spaces in the names.
    - [991101] Metris macro fix, OSD bug fix, NT display fix.
    - [991101] New - color scheme, GVim look.
    - [991101] New - Unix/Linux support for Wheel Mouse (mouse.emf).
    - [991101] New - Color schemes, Plain; for those that do not care for
      an abundance of colors.
    - [991101] Modified the numeric key-pad behavior to be consistent on
      all platforms. Problems were noted with the UNIX number lock
      orientation which was reversed.
    - [991101] New - Color scheme variables which allow the hkXXX files to
      determine the level of hilighting to apply to their templates.
    - [991101] Line length fix; more graceful behavior (i.e. does not
      crash) when the line length exceeds 64K.
    - [991101] Intercept the windows 105 keyboard application key
      (typically right hand side of keyboard next to the control key). The
      key is called "menu". By default this is bound in win32.emf, however
      users may bind it as a prefix for their own key combinations in much
      the same way as "Alt" or "C-x" if required.
    - [991101] New; OMG's IDL language template added.
    - [991101] Fix for windows short name in next-buffer.

cEcEQUESTION (00) cEcA


    New functionality; what is useful to me as an old MicroEmacs user ??


cEANSWER cA


    There are a lot of new features in this distribution. Assuming that you
    just want to use the editor (and have cottoned onto the fact that there
    are now scroll bars etc.) then the most frequent commands that we use
    are:-

    lsgrep(3)lmgrep(3)le - May need to set up in cC<user>.emfcA.  
    lsdiff(3)lmdiff(3)le - May need to set up in cC<user>.emfcA.  
    lscompile(3)lmcompile(3)le - May need to set up in cC<user>.emfcA.  
    lsclean(3)lmclean(3)le - cleans a buffer, removing spaces etc.  
    lsrestyle-buffer(3)lmrestyle-buffer(3)le - Reformats 'C' + known languages.  
    lsspell-buffer(3)lmspell-buffer(3)le - For documentation work, spells the buffer.  
    cDC-scA - lsisearch-forward(2)lmisearch-forward(2)le incremental search.  
    cDC-x ucA or cGC-_cA - lsundo(2)lmundo(2)le undoes edits.  
    cDF10cA - lsfile-browser(3)lmfile-browser(3)le allows the file system to be browsed  

    Other useful macros include:-

    lstabs-to-spaces(3)lmtabs-to-spaces(3)le - Good for sorting out the mess made by Microsoft Developer Studio.  
    lssort-lines(2)lmsort-lines(2)le - Two versions of this, allows marked lines to be sorted alphabetically.  

    Be wary of:-

     cDesc-ocA - lsfill-paragraph(2)lmfill-paragraph(2)le. The default mode is an automatic
    mode  which attempts to guess at the format required. It works most of the time. 
    Also works in 'C'.

    Most of the other new features are in the background, such as the macro  
    processor, indentation control, color hilighting, indentation control,  
    auto-saving etc.

    To have a look at the features developed since 2009 have a look at lsfaq44(0f)lmfaq44le and 
    lsfaq45(0f)lmfaq45le.

cEcEQUESTION (01) cEcA


    Languages; Are any foreign languages supported other than English ??


cEANSWER cA


    Unfortunately as we started with V3.8 as a base many years ago, we missed  
    the distribution with foreign language extensions. We have not  
    incorporated them into the release.  

    The May 1999 release improves the language support by supporting the  
    ISO-Latin character sets.  

    We do have spelling dictionaries for French, Spanish, Portuguese and  
    German. Other languages may be supported by transforming native cDispell(1)cA  
    dictionaries.  

    If there is enough interest in this release from people with foreign  
    languages then we may consider including support for foreign language(s).  
    However we would be very much reliant on external help for local testing  
    and translation. We would be open to suggestions.

! 0ffaq02
cEcEQUESTION (02) cEcA


    C++ is not default, C is - how do I change this ??


cEANSWER cA


    If your main programming language is C++, then you will require the cG.defcA  
    and cG.hcA files to be loaded in C++ mode by default, rather than 'C'. To  
    modify this hen the order of the file hooks has to be re-defined.  

    Within your cC<user>.emfcA, over-ride the default ordering by including the
    line:-
    
sB
          add-file-hook ".h .def"                                     fhook-cpp

sA
    This adds a newer binding for cGcG.hcAcA and cGcG.defcAcA to C++, over-riding the  
    existing 'C' binding.

! 0ffaq03
cEcEQUESTION (03) cEcA


    GNU Emacs; are there any GNU Emacs bindings. ?


cEANSWER cA


    No not at the moment. The GNU Emacs bindings would be added as a  
    compatibility file (meemacs.emf) in much the same way that the me3.8  
    bindings are added, see meme3_8.emf.

    From the user-setup(3), the user would then ask for "gnu" compatibility.

    We would welcome submissions for a gnu compatibility file, gnu.emf, to add  
    to the release.

    The cDMetacA key (typically cGAltcA) may be bound to key strokes, as opposed to  
    the menu short-cut from the lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le as follows:-  

    cDToolscA -> cDUser SetupcA -> cDGeneralcA -> cDAlt Action: Main Menu Hot-keyscA = N
    cDToolscA -> cDUser SetupcA -> cDGeneralcA -> cDAlt Action: Esc PrefixcA = Y

cEcEQUESTION (04) cEcA


    Icons are not displayed correctly in Microsoft Windows environments !!


cEANSWER cA


    After installing on Microsoft platforms, the Icons in the Explorer window  
    may not be showing correctly. To remedy the situation then the following  
    steps may be taken.  

    cDWindows '95cA
    
       Try re-starting the system first. If the icons are still incorrect
       then re-start in Safe mode and delete the file:

           `c:\windows\ShellIconCache`

    Restart and the Icons should be correct.

    cDWindow '98cA
    
        Try re-starting the system first. If the Icons are still incorrect
        then re-start in Safe mode, this should re-generate the Icon cache.
        Restart windows.

    cDNTcA
    
        Restart the system.

cEcEQUESTION (05) cEcA


    ipipes not working on Microsoft Windows network drives ?


cEANSWER cA


    We are aware of a problem with the ipipe commands with '95 and '98 (not 
    sure about NT) when the current drive is a Novel network drive.

    Although we have not been ably to fully characterize the problem, we know 
    that:-

    - Old Novel Clients prior to 2.2 - Does not work
    - Novel Intranetware Client 2.2 - Does not work.
    - Novel Network Client 2.5 - Does work.
    - Novel Client 3.01 - Does work.

    Any other information in this area would be appreciated to fully  
    characterize the problem.

    To get around the problem then disable ipipes using ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le. From
    within your cC<user>.emfcA knock off bit 0x800 from ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le. This will
    enable regular pipes, which will work, albeit not in the background.

cEcEQUESTION (06) cEcA


    Language not supported - will it be ??


cEANSWER cA


    We only support the (programming) languages that we have come into contact
    with. If you are using a language that we are not supporting then you will
    need to write a new cGhk<language>.emfcA file. See lslanguageTemplates(2)lmLanguage Templatesle on how
    to map a new programming language. The list of currently supported file
    types is defined in lsMicroEmacs - Supported File TypeslmSupported File Typesle.

    Jasspa would appreciate any new templates that people define for standard
    file types so that we can add them to the distribution.

    For Microsoft Windows, any associated "me" icons types would also be
    appreciated.

- [[FAQ Index]](Frequently Asked Questions).
! 0ffaq07
cEcEQUESTION (07) cEcA


    Language file is incomplete


cEANSWER cA


    For a number of the (programming) language templates we have only provided
    a sub-set of the commands, this is typically because we only use a sub-set
    ourselves.

    For a number of templates, there is no indent support (see lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le and
    lsMicroEmacs - Supported File Types)lmSupported File Typesle.

    Note that when extending the template then only standard words should be
    added. Words which are local extensions should be added to a cGmyXXX.emfcA.

    Input locked up and not accepting keys; how do I unlock ?


cEANSWER cA


    This sometimes happens if a macro has been aborted badly. Typically a few
    "Ctrl-G"s (see lsabort-command(2)lmabort-command(2)le) will terminate the macro and return
    control back to the caller.

    (or Current) the macro file cGmeme3_8.emfcA is executed and the bindings

    Microsoft Windows Locks up after killing an ipipe.


cEANSWER cA


    This is a known problem for '95/'98 (not NT), on killing an ipipe.  
    Sometimes the "Winoldapp" locks up, if this is the case use "Alt-Ctrl-Del"
    to bring up the "cDClose ProgramcA" dialogue, kill off the cGcGWinOldAppcAcA if it
    is not responding.

    MicroEmacs will then come back. We are looking for ways around this
    problem at the moment. From the programming perspective Windows is just
    not as nice as UNIX - which just works !!

! 0ffaq11
cEcEQUESTION (11) cEcA


    Mouse support under Microsoft windows is strange !!


cEANSWER cA


    The mouse operation under Microsoft windows (and DOS) is biased towards a
    3-button mouse operation (Logitech is ideal !!), operating in a similar
    way to UNIX. i.e. <select> operation gets text <Middle button> yanks text
    back.

    This stems from the fact that we all came from UNIX backgrounds. We have
    had a number of comments about this already and do plan to address this
    issue.

    cDNote:-cA Those of you that have already had a little dip into the operation
    of the mouse will have probably worked out that the whole of the visible
    mouse/screen interaction is driven through macros, so this functionality
    is actually a macro change.

cEcEQUESTION (12) cEcA


    Scroll bars too narrow !!


cEANSWER cA


    You can change the width of the scroll bars to double width from
    lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le "Wide Scroll Bars".  
    Alternatively, you may do this yourself from cG<user>.emfcA by:-

sA 
    See ls$scroll-bar(5)lm$scroll-bar(5)le.

    Remember if you have enabled wide scroll bars, under windows, or
    X-Windows, you may want to change your start-up screen width to cG82cA
    characters rather than cG80cA - see lschange-frame-width(2)lmchange-frame-width(2)le.

cEcEQUESTION (13) cEcA


    Tab key; Why does the tab key not operate in some windows ??


cEANSWER cA


    In buffers with indentation information the tab key re-computes the
    indentation of the line. This behavior may be changed from the user-setup.

! 0ffaq14
cEcEQUESTION (14) cEcA


    Termcap; On a color terminal why is there no color ??


cEANSWER cA


    MicroEmacs has to be enabled to show color by default. From lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le
    enable "Termcap Color". This will give you basic colors.

    You may also try  enabling  "With  Bold" - this may  increase  the  range of
    colors.  If still  there  are no  colors  you might try to run emacs  with a
    different  terminal  setting,  for  instance  using  cGTERM=xterm  me  -ncA or
    cGTERM=xterm me -ncA or cGTERM=rxvt  meccA in dependence  what type of me you are
    using.  Check if you get the color,  usually  setting  the  variable to term
    works best with regards to keys  (backspace  problems) and colors.  Settings
    might differ however in dependence to the used terminal emulator or terminal
    multiplexer.

    Termcap; Some of the keys do not work - how can I bind them ?


cEANSWER cA


    In your user setup <user>.emf add the new keys. You have to be careful as
    to the environment and probably need to do something like the following:-

cEANSWER cA


    If some of the components of the windows are rendered incorrectly,
    typically caused by local variations of character sets, then new window
    component characters may be defined. See ls$window-chars(5)lm$window-chars(5)le for details on
    how to define new character replacements.

cEcEQUESTION (18) cEcA


    Windows Autosave and Backup files; are these potentially a problem ?


cEANSWER cA


    For windows '95 up until OEM service release 2, the OS could not
    distinguish the difference between the files:-


       .xxx
       .xxx~


    on a read, we have managed to find a work around for this, however we
    would advise that the 3 letter extension is adhered to for these releases.
    For releases of '95 OEM service release 2 and greater, '98 and NT we have
    not found a problem with any of the auto save and backup naming.

    Obviously, the backup naming will depend on the native file system. For
    instance if your system administrator has not enabled long file names on
    your Novel server.

    We suggest that "cDCourier NewcA" is used as the print font. This scales well
    and supports the full character set. Problems have been reported with

cEcEQUESTION (21) cEcA


    Printing; My printer is not supported ?


cEANSWER cA


    We are in the process of providing native postscript generation - UNIX
    users can stream their output through "a2ps" and then into their standard
    printer queues.

    Windows, the support is already built in.

    For DOS then you need to get your printer manual out and sort out how to
    map the printer codes onto fonts. The printer codes are added to
    cGcGprinter.erfcAcA. We have already provided support for the HP DeskJet printer
    (PCL), look at this printer definition for some help as to the type of
    information that you need to set up. It's all a bit fiddley, but you do
    not get much choice if you want more than plain ASCII out.

cEcEQUESTION (24) cEcA


    Windows - Where is app850.fon ?


cEANSWER cA


    "app850.fon" is the font file used for the DOS window under '95/'95/NT.
    You should find it in your c: hidden. If you search from the
    Explorer->Tools->Find "app850.fon" it should be found in the fonts
    directory. There is nothing to be done - the file exists and is in the
    correct location.

    If you do not have this file then, you might have "appXXX.fon", or some
    other fixed font. You can locate the file that you want as follows:-

        Start->Settings->Control Panel->Fonts

    Display the font list as 'details'. Within that list you should find a
    "MS-DOS CPXXX" entry. It will be a red font (if you are in monochrome then
    it will have a 'A' in the box rather than a 'Tt'). This is a fixed font
    and will be a good alternative to "app850.fon", you can also try the
    "Fixedsys" font file which has some weird name.

    To be honest I do not know what Microsoft are currently shipping. Most of
    the Windows platforms that I have used have been upgrades or been abused
    by so many people you never know what is original !!

    We would be interested in any details of other fixed fonts, which support
    the full OEM character set that are better alternatives to the DOS ones.

cEcEQUESTION (26) cEcA


    C or C++ indentation and effects; how can I turn off ?


cEANSWER cA


    The C mode indentation is supposed to make editing 'C' easier, by forcing
    the user to follow a preset editing convection. The layout is pretty
    standard, following a 4 space indent, writing either K&R or standard
    'Pascal' type layout, with braces aligning vertically.

    The problem most new users have is the inability of the tab key to
    function, or more simply do not want to be 'forced' to write in a
    particular style (GNU writers will probably not like this either -
    conversely they will be using GNU emacs !!). However the constrained
    layout can be configured to create most styles and does help in a project
    situation, whereby most of the authored code roughly adheres to the same
    sort of layout conventions. For C++ users then edit cGcGhkcpp.emfcAcA rather
    than cGcGhkc.emfcAcA.


cETo turn off all automatic 'C' layout  cA


    To disable ALL automatic layout in C and C++ files then from the menu

        help -> Buffer Setup -> Setup Auto Indent


    Or from the command line cDesc x buffer-setupcA and disable through the
    dialogue.

    Restart the editor.


cETo re-enable the <tab> key  cA


    To retain the 'C' layout aid, but re-enable the tab key operation then
    disable the cDTab To IndentcA option in lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le i.e.

    cDToolscA -> cDUser SetupcA -> cDGeneralcA -> cDTab To IndentcA

    This enables the use of the TAB key in all column positions with the
    exception of column 0. A <tab> in Column 0 will still enable the automatic
    line re-formatting.

    If you want real <Tabs> then disable the cDtabcA mode using lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le i.e.

    cDToolscA -> cDUser SetupcA -> cDGeneralcA -> cDTabcA


cETo change the 'C' Indentation Layout  cA


    The 'C' layout indentation is controlled from the lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le command (see
    cGhkc.emfcA), the indentation level is controlled by the variables
    ls$buffer-indent-width(5)lm$buffer-indent-width(5)le and ls$buffer-indent(5)lm$buffer-indent(5)le these may be changed in the
    cDBuffer SetupcA dialog.

cEcEQUESTION (27) cEcA


    fill-paragraph function does not fill ??

    I can't seem to get the fill-paragraph function to fill the following
    paragraph:

       This is a very
       poorly formed paragraph
       which refuses to fill
       properly!


cEANSWER cA


    The default justification mode is Auto which tries to work out the mode
    required for each paragraph. Its fairly smart at maintaining a documents
    indentation, e.g. consider the example right hand justified:

                                                              This is a very
                                                     poorly formed paragraph
                                                       which refuses to fill
                                                                   properly!


    It will maintain this indentation. The problem comes when the detected
    form is not the required form as in the example. The detected paragraph
    justification to be used is "none" because the lines are short. There are
    2 ways to solve this problem:

    - You can change the ls$fill-mode(5)lm$fill-mode(5)le to left or both (in fhook-doc mode
      use C-c l or C-c b) and then use fill-paragraph as normal.
    - Manually concatenate the first few lines into one to create a longer
      first line and then use the fill-paragraph a normal, i.e. change the
      paragraph to:

       `This is a very poorly formed paragraph which refuses to fill` properly!

    and then fill. This works because the longer line will lead to a
    different assessment of what's required.

    Key modifier which acts as the ESC key; what is it ?

    What is the modifier key which acts as the ESC key ? Having to type ESCAPE
    and then f to move one word forward is very boring.

    With Gnu Emacs (on Unix systems), there is a "meta" modifier key which is
    a shortcut for pressing ESCAPE followed by the command key. The "meta" key
    should be the "Alt" key.


cEANSWER cA


    The "meta" key is the "Alt" key. But 'F' is the Main menu hot-key for the
    'File' sub-menu so by default 'A-f' will open the File sub-menu. This can
    be disabled by clearing bit 0x2000 in the $system variable. This option
    can now be set using user-setup (Alt -> Main Menu).

    find-file start location; where is it ?


cEANSWER cA


    The lsfind-file(2)lmfind-file(2)le start location is defined as follows:-

    - cG*scratch*cA is current buffer; the current working directory.
    - cGfilecA is current buffer; the directory location containing cCfilecA.

    Running under Microsoft Windows or UNIX, using an icon launch, then it may
    become frustrating that the start location is always cGC:\ProgramcA
    cGFiles\JASSPA\MicroEmacscA (Microsoft windows) or cG/usr/local/bincA (UNIX) this
    is simply resolved by starting the executable with the cD-ccA option, as
    defined by lsme(1)lmme(1)le. The cD-ccA option starts the editor with the last editing
    session, this is typically where a user will want to commence an editing
    session.

    If the cD-ccA approach is not acceptable, then it is worth defining the
    environment variable cG$HOMEcA within the start up script, or in the users
    environment. Using cDfind-filecA with tilde (cG~cA) implies that the directory

    Re-using a MicroEmacs session; how to ??


cEANSWER cA


    A MicroEmacs editing session may be re-used, such that the current editor
    is prompted to load a new file externally. This is typically invoked from
    a short-cut launch from a file manager i.e. cDExplorer(1)cA, cDTkdesk(1)cA etc.

    In order to facilitate the re-use of the session, then lsme(1)lmme(1)le is invoked
    with the cD-ocA option, this locates the active editor session and passes the
    file load request. If an existing session does not exist then a new
    session is started.

    In order for this mechanism to operate, then the lsClient-Server(2)lmClient-Server Interfacele
    must be enabled from the lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le i.e.

    cDToolscA -> cDUser SetupcA -> cDPlatformcA

    The font selection depends upon the platform, in all cases a fixed font

    If you are running on Microsoft platforms ensure that the cDOEM/ANSIcA flag
    matches the settings of the cDDisplay Font SetcA entry.
    
    With MicroEmacs releases after 2022 you might as well use a function 
    lschange-font-type(3)lmchange-font-type(3)le which allows you to switch the font
    in an interactive menu on X-Windows systems. You can as well use a tool like

    File Types; how do I interchange between UNIX, Windows and DOS files ??


cEANSWER cA


    MicroEmacs 2009 facilitates the editing of the standard file types on all
    platforms. All files retain their line ending type through edits. i.e. if
    a DOS file is edited on a UNIX system, the file is still written as a DOS
    file. When new files are created, they are created with the standard
    attributes of the host O/S.

    The line ending of the file may be modified from the menu

    cDfilecA -> cDattributescA

    This brings up a dialog that allows the file type and attributes to be
    modified.

    Note that the only ending that is NOT preserved are files whose lines end

cEcEQUESTION (38) cEcA


    Some keys on my foreign keyboard do not work properly, how do I get them
    working ??


cEANSWER cA


    The most common problem are with foreign keyboards where the <AltGr> key
    is used to generate some characters in a similar fashion to the <Shift>
    key. For example, on a Belgian keyboard the '9' key produces a '{'
    character when the <AltGr> key is also pressed.

    The quickest and best solution is to use the cDKeyboardcA setup on the
    Start-Up page of lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le. This however may not 
    provide the solution as not all keyboards are currently supported.  
    If you are using an unsupported keyboard please send configuration 
    information back to JASSPA for inclusion in the next release.   
    The keyboard configuration information is stored in the macro file cGkeyboard.emfcA.

    If cDuser-setupcA does not currently support your keyboard, or you wish to
    remap some keys, then the command lstranslate-key(2)lmtranslate-key(2)le should be used.  
    cDtranslate-keycA remaps generated key stroke(s) into another key at a low
    level so the mapping is supported in all areas. If a macro and key binding
    were used instead, while they would work in the main text windows, they
    would not work in the message line. See help on cDtranslate-keycA for more
    information.

    Note that some <AltGr> keys can produce 2 keys, for example on a Belgian
    keyboard '<AltGr>-9' produces the key 'A-C-9' first, immediately followed
    by 'A-C-{'. This is an unfortunate side effect of windows, it is better to
    have two keys rather than none. But this does add confusion to the
    problem! Again, see cDtranslate-keycA for more information.

    Tabs; How to change the tab width ??


cEANSWER cA


    ls$tab-width(5)lm$tab-width(5)le controls the size of the displayed tab character
    (number of spaces) and the simulated tab character size, where the user entered tab
    character is replaced by a number of space characters. The latter is only
    used when lstab(2m)lmtab(2m)le mode is enabled (it is typically enabled by default).

    To change the tab character width then the lsset-variable(2)lmset-variable(2)le command is
    used:

       esc x set-variable


    You will then be prompted for the remaining arguments. cG<TAB>cA is the
    completion so:-

       esc x set-v<TAB>
       $tab-width<TAB>
       2


    If this is the setting that you always want to use then it is easier if
    you put this in your <user.emf> as:-

sB
          set-variable $tab-width 2

sA
    then whenever you start a new session you will always have the cG$tab-widthcA
    defined as you want it.

    If you are reading in a file with TAB's embedded then you can convert all
    of the <TAB>'s to spaces using lstabs-to-spaces(3)lmtabs-to-spaces(3)le:

       esc x tabs-to-spaces

    Home/End Keys; How do I change the default bindings ??


cEANSWER cA


    Some users prefer the cGHOMEcA and cGENDcA keys to map to the beginning and end of
    the line, rather than beginning/end of the buffer, respectively. Within
    the cC<user>.emfcA the following global bindings may be applied to re-assign
    the key mappings:-

sB
          global-bind-key "beginning-of-buffer" "C-home"
          global-bind-key "end-of-buffer"       "C-end"
          global-bind-key "end-of-line"         "end"
          global-bind-key "beginning-of-line"   "home"

    tags; How do I generate a MicroEmacs compatible tags file ??


cEANSWER cA


    A cDtagscA file is used by the lsfind-tag(2)lmfind-tag(2)le command. This is used to hypertext
    to the cCtaggedcA definition or variable. The standard cDctags(1)cA format is used
    by MicroEmacs. The cDtagscA file itself may be generated by MicroEmacs 2009
    from the menu (cCTools->XX Tools->Create Tags FilecA). Alternatively a cDtagscA
    file may be generated by the cDctags(1)cA utility. This is typically standard
    on UNIX platforms. For Windows and DOS platforms then the cDExuberant CtagscA
    is recommended, this is available from:-

        http://darren.hiebert.com

    A MicroEmacs 2009 compatible tags file may be generated using the command
    line "`ctags -N --format=1 ."` cataloging the current directory. To generate
    cDtagscA for a directory tree then use cG`ctags -NR --format=1 .`cA. Refer to the
    cDExuberant CtagscA documentation for a more detailed description of the
    utility.

    The user variable ls%tag-option(5)lm%tag-option(5)le may be used to enable lsfind-tag(2)lmfind-tag(2)le to
    locate a recursivelly generated cDtagscA file from a parent directory.

cEcEQUESTION (43) cEcA


    ne; how can I enable line wrapping in NE ??


cEANSWER cA


    The line wrapping feature is controlled by the wrap buffer-mode in ME but
    this feature is omitted in NE. To get the size of NE down many features
    have to be disabled including the wrap mode and fill-paragraph.

    To enable then you have to build your own version of NE with this enabled
    by changing the 2nd MEOPT_WORDPRO settings in "emain.h" to 1.
    Alternatively rename your ne.emf to me.emf and use 'me' instead of ne.

    Once it is built and you want to edit a text file then you need to enable
    WRAP and INDENT mode in the buffer for it to behave correctly. WRAP does
    the wrap to the next line and INDENT maintains the left indentation.
    fill-paragraph is present.

cEcEQUESTION (44) cEcA


    Why is MicroEmacs called MicroEmacs 09 in 2024 ??


cEANSWER cA

    MicroEmacs was mainly developed by John Green and Steven Phillips in the 1990ies
    and in the 2010s. The last official release was in 2009. Since then the development
    was stalled mainly do to the closing of yahoogroups as the communication was lost
    within the small user base. On Github are a few forks which did some fixes but which
    were not coordinated. Currently the branch at https://github.com/mittelmark/microemacs
    is the one which is developed. As there exists another newer branch with more features
    like https, SVN and Git support I (Detlef Groth) decided to stick with the old name
    MicroEmacs and add the last release years at the end. So the versions will stick with
    09 to distinguish it from the new version which will be hopefully released in 2024 as
    MicroEmacs 24. So the versioning scheme of this MicroEmacs is v09.12.XX - where I will
    count up the XX from 23 to 31 of neccessary. Currently we (Steven Phillips and me)
    focus on the release of MicroEmacs 24. MicroEmacs 09 will contain just bug fixes.

    The last official 09 release from 2009 can be download from http://www.jasspa.com -
    the updated release from https://github.com/mittelmark/microemacs

cEcEQUESTION (45) cEcA


    What are the main new features of MicroEmacs 09 in 2024 ??  


cEANSWER cA


    MicroEmacs  09 in 2024  contains  a few fixes to  compile it with the modern
    GCC. It provides the following new features (often added by Steven  Phillips
    to the new MicroEmacs 24 (which is not published yet) and then backported by
    me to MicroEmacs 09):
    
    - in terminal mode on Unix using the alternate buffer feature which supports
      suspension  without editor traces, so the buffer clears during  suspension
      with Ctrl-z
    - fixing frame resize on X-Windows which might before destroy the window layout
      on some tiling window managers
    - better font support on X11 using true type fonts as well as the old pixmaps fonts
    - simplified font selection on X-windows using lschange-font-type(3)lmchange-font-type(3)le
    - font-resize with Ctrl-Plus and Ctrl-Minus
    - support for  Windows-cp1252  encodings if the font  supports it, so you an
      get an Euro symbol ...,  Windows-cp1250  (Central European - Polish, Czech
      etc) and Windows-cp1251  (Cyrillian) are as well now available if the user
      has a monospaced font with these encodings
    - more editor schemes, mainly interesting Dracula and Ayu-Light schemes 
    - improved template handling using an interactive menu to select templates
      from the users config directory (.jasspa in your HOME directory), create a
      subfolder r for R templates and place your etf files there
    - new binary builds for macOS 11-14 (as well as for Windows and Ubuntu and Fedora Linuxes)
    - much improved C++, Python, R and Markdown mode, support for highlighting R
      or Python  code chunks in Markdown documents
    - improved CUA bindings - shortcut emulation more common in standard GUI
      applications like C-c, C-x, C-v for copy, cut and paste 
    - new lsjeany-bindings(3)lmjeany-bindings(3)le command which supports a few CUA bindings
      after the C-j prefix so copy, cut and paste are cGC-j C-c`, `C-j C-xcA and `C-j C-v`.

cEcEQUESTION (46) cEcA

 
    What is a bfs executuable?
    
    Here the text from John Green from the MicroEmacs website from 2009:
    
    The  motivation  behind  this  latest  development  was to  produce  a fully
    featured  version  of JASSPA  MicroEmacs  which  included  all of the macros
    (which do most of the work) in a single  executable  package  that  could be
    transported to different systems without  installing  anything. i.e. copy it
    onto the system and run it.  Secondly  we  realised  that we also  wanted to
    customise the macros contained within such that we could carry round our own
    extensions but did not necessarily want to re-build the binary as the target
    systems we wanted to run on might not  contain  all of the  necessary  build
    tools and libraries to re-build the image. Thirdly  anything we added to the
    executable must contain a hierarchical file structure and must be a platform
    independent  format which may be constructed and manipulated on any platform
    whilst being space efficient.

    The  solution  was to  obviously  tack the  information  onto the end of the
    executable as we know where the  executable  is. The next problem was how to
    append  information  onto the  executable  that we can  retrieve at runtime.
    There was obviously  conventional  archive formats, but they are not so good
    at run-time traversal, in addition there were no tools to add and remove the
    archive. A cat would of course append  information to the end of a file, but
    removal  is much more  difficult.  In the end we came up with a new  archive
    format that performed with conventional file system commands such as listing
    a directory  and reading files in addition  added  compression  such that we
    could  efficiently  reduce the size of the data  attachment.  Given that the
    archive is being  placed at the bottom of the  executable  then the  archive
    must be located  from the bottom. The end result is a built-in  file  system
    format  called bfs, this in  hindsight  was  probably not a really good name
    because it conflicts with the BEoS file system  (latterly we have settled on
    the Tacky  (Tacked-on)  File  System or tfs but have yet to perform the name
    space move).

    The bfs command line utility is used to manipulate the archive and attach it
    to the  executable,  its basic  operation is outlined  below. The  following
    examples  use me.exe as a clearer  example of which item is the  executable.
    Obviously  in a UNIX type  environment  then the .exe suffix is not used and
    does not exist.

    To build a bfs archive then simply  unpack the metree and remove things that
    you do not want in the archive:

         % tar zxvf jasspa-metree-20091017.tar.gz
         % rm -rf ./jasspa/pixmaps        # Delete the pixmaps not required.
         % rm -rf  ./jasspa/spelling      # Delete the empty spelling directory.
         % rm -rf  ./jasspa/company       # Delete the empty company directory.
         % rm -f ./jasspa/macros/null     # Delete the null file.
              
    You can add new things  such as a spelling  dictionary,  some of your  private
    files etc. DO NOT add the dynamic  files such as user.erf or the session files
    as the archive is READ-ONLY and cannot write back any saved session or history
    information.

    Build the  archive  and add to an  executable  from a different  directory  to
    create a new executable with BFS archive attached:

         % bfs -a mypath/mecw.exe -o me.exe ./jasspa
      
    Append an already existing archive to the executable:

         % bfs -a mypath/mecw.exe -o me.exe jasspa-metree-20091117.bfs
      
    This  should now be a stand alone  executable.  If you append  again it will
    remove the old archive and add a new one.

    The archive may be updated in place using  either a directory  or a .bfs file.
    This will  remove the  existing  archive and replace it with the new  archive.
    i.e.

         % bfs -a me.exe ./jasspa          # Add a new archive from directory.
         % bfs -a me.exe jasspa.bfs        # Add a pre-built archive.
        
    You can list the archive attached to the executable:

         % bfs -l me.exe
      
    You can test the archive attached to the executable:

         % bfs -t me.exe
      
    You can get some information on the archive attached to the executable:

         % bfs -i me.exe
      
    You can remove (or strip) the archive attached to the executable:

         % bfs -s me.exe
      
    You can extract the archive  attached to the executable which will extract the
    directory tree in the archive to a new directory called oldarch.

         % bfs -x oldarch me.exe        # Extract to directory called "oldarch"
         % bfs -f oldarch.bfs me.exe    # Extract to a file called "oldarch.bfs"
        
    We  mentioned in the preamble  that bfs is  architecture  independent  and a
    little  endian Linux  executable or big endian Sun sparc  executable  may be
    safely manipulated and appended by a Windows version of bfs, and vice versa.
    bfs treats all files as binary hence care should be taken with line endings,
    although  MicroEmacs is not directly  affected by the different  line ending
    forms.

cECustomizing the executable cA

    The standard bfs archive built by JASSPA contains the standard macros but no
    customization  so when a user  wishes  to bundle  their  macros  and  common
    extensions the following steps outline how to do it.

    Firstly lets assume that the user starts from the supplied attached archive,
    the first thing to do is to extract it and then modify it.

          % bfs -x myarch me.exe      # Extract to directory called "myarch"
      
    The extracted tree will have two directories:

          myarch/macros
          myarch/contrib
        
    Assuming that the user wants to add a spelling dictionary, then create a new
    directory called spelling and place the required  spelling  dictionary files
    in this new  directory (we selected the US  dictionary  here). Note that you
    can include more than one spelling dictionary file set in here:

         % mkdir myarch/spelling
         % (cd myarch/spelling; tar zxvf pathto/ls_enus.tar.gz)
        
    If you have some company wide files then create a directory  called  company
    and place the macro files into this directory:

        % mkdir myarch/company
        % cp pathto/companyfiles* myarch/company
        
    If you have your own private  extensions then it is suggested that you place
    these at the top level i.e. in the myarch  directory.  Note that the private
    files  include  a user  name  component  so some may not be found if you are
    logged in as a different  user, so consider  carefully the files to transfer
    across. DO NOT place any  dynamic  files into the archive as it is read only
    i.e.  user.erf as these cannot be written. It is strongly  recommended  that
    the files in the  myarch/macros are not changed as this enables user changes
    that do not work to be  easily  backed  out;  placing  a file in the  myarch
    directory  is  used  in  preference  to, and  overrides,  the  same  file in
    myarch/macros.

         % cp pathto/myfiles* myarch
      
    With the archive  directory  composed  then we simply add it to the end of the
    executable, this operation displaces any old archive with the new one:

         % bfs -a me.exe ./myarch
      
    Now  when  you run the  executable  it will  contain  the  archive  that you
    constructed.  Note that the  attached  archive is last in the search path so
    any macro  files  found in the file  system in the normal  search  path will
    override the same macro files that exist in the archive.

    
cEAccessing  the file  system  from within  MicroEmacs cA

    The bfs file  system is  accessible  from  within  MicroEmacs  using the URL
    bfs://. The directory location may be traversed by the user and files may be
    copied out and executed within the editor from this location. i.e.

          C-x C-f bfs://
      
    results in a directory listing of the file system:

          Directory listing of: bfs://
          4833  used in 0 files and 4 dirs (Not-Filtered)
      
          Attr    Size             Modified Name
          dr-x      21  2009/11/21 18:16:38 ../
          dr-x     152  2009/11/21 18:16:38 contrib/
          dr-x    4639  2009/11/21 18:16:38 macros/
            
    Note that the bfs://  location  is  automatically  placed on the file search
    path in the colon  separated  list and is  referenced  as {bfs} in the colon
    separated search path list.

cEKnown Issues cA


    JASSPA MicroEmacs is not starting up in a X-Windows mode on Fedora 11/12 and
    possibly some other RedHat  systems. On executing me then it silently  fails
    to start. The reason for this is that the  built-in  default  font cannot be
    resolved. In order to fix this then the following steps may be taken:

    Create a file .Xresources in the $HOME directory if it does not already exist.
    Add the line


          MicroEmacs*font: -*-fixed-medium-r-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

    to the .Xresources file.

    Merge the local resources definitions to the XServer with the command:

          % xrdb -merge $HOME/.Xresources

    After  performing  these  steps then any  pre-built  MicroEmacs  will run up
    correctly and not silently fail. If you wish to re-build the binary with the
    default font then edit unixterm.c::2976 and change the default font string.

cEcEQUESTION (47) cEcA

    How can I use True Type Fonts within MicroEmacs on a X11 system ??  
    
    Wheras  in the  terminal  you use your  terminal  emulator  to choose a nice
    looking font, for the  X11-Windows  application  you are on your own. If you
    are on  Linux  with an X11  server  the  availability  of  fonts  to be used
    directly within  MicroEmacs is first rather limited and restricted mostly to Bitmap
    fonts like misc-fixed or or -bitstream-courier.. To graphically  explore
    the available  fonts you can use a tool like xfontsel.  Using an other tool,
    mkfontscale, you can however index as well True or Open Type Fonts to be
    used  within  X11  applications.  You can  place  your ttf and otf fonts for
    instance  in the  cG~/fontscA  folder  within  your  home  directory  and  run
    thereafter the tools mkfontscale, mkfontdir and xset like this:
    
          cd ~/.fonts
          mkfontdir .         # indexing filenames
          mkfontscale .       # indexing encodings
          xset +fp `pwd`      # extend the font search path
          xset fp rehash      # let the X-server know about
    
    In case of trouble you can reset the font search path to the original search
    path by writing this:

          xset fp default
          xset fp rehash

    You can now inspect the file  fonts.dir  to see the  available  font strings
    usuable by X11 applications:
    
    For instance my fonts.dir contains the line:
    
        CCONSOLA.TTF -microsoft-consolas-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-m-0-microsoft-cp1252

    Indicating that I can use this font with a cp1252 encodingm the extended ISO
    encoding by  Microsoft.  I can write this string into the user setup  dialog
    together  with a fontsize  which  should  come  directly  after the two minus
    digits:
    
        CCONSOLA.TTF -microsoft-consolas-medium-r-normal--22-0-0-0-m-0-microsoft-cp1252
      
    Selecting  Windows  ANSI as the  character  set  allows me to use the extend
    character set within my  application. If you use "esc x  insert-symbol"  you
    see for instance that the Euro symbol is available.
    
    On the Github  project  page,  https://github.com/mittelmark/microemacs  you
    will find a download link for some indexed monospaced TTF fonts.

    How to work with the terminal version of MicroEmacs on terminals with UTF-8
    encoding?
    
    If you run the terminal  version of  MicroEmacs  the character  encodings are
    defined  by the  terminal  emulator.  For some of them  (like Mate or Gnome
    terminal)  you can  change  the font  encodings  using a menu,  others  like
    LX-terminal the terminal multiplexer like tmux - only support
    Unicode  encodings. If you work with MicroEmacs on such a terminal, the display
    of non-ASCII characters might behave weird. There are two ways to fix this issue:
    
    - switch  the  current  font  encoding  for  your  terminal if possible, let's
      say to ISO-8859-1 or ISO-8859-15 or what ever you need ... or
    - run a  tool  like  cGluitcA - https://invisible-island.net/luit/luit-figures.html
      as a  wrapping  application  which  sits  between  MicroEmacs  and the terminal
      emulator  and  translates all codes  from and  to  Unicode between these two 
      applications.
      
    Here an example on how to do this:
    
      `TERM=xterm luit -encoding ISO-8859-15 mec`
    
    Or write at the end cGme -ncA if you use a mecw executuable. The TERM=xterm
    prefix should enable the colored version in the terminal as well as described
    in lsfaq14(0f)lmfaq14le.
    
    
    The cGluitcA application should be available by your package manager, so it
    should be installable as:
    
         sudo dnf install luit        ## fedora  
         sudo apt install x11-utils   ## debian based
         sudo pacman -S   luit        ## arch based   
         sudo pkg install luit        ## freebsd
                                      ## windows-cygwin  

    You can as well create an alias for the luit-me command ensemble:       
    
       aliasc me-iso-15="TERM=xterm luit -encoding ISO-8859-15 mec"
    
    One  disadvantage  of using cGluitcA is, that you can't suspend MicroEmacs if running
    it within  cGluitcA. To get  suspension  you might use  another  tools  called
    abduco which allows you to suspend a terminal session in in principle. Aduco
    is as well a standard  tool on Linux  systems  which  should be  installable
    using your package manager like thist:
    
         sudo dnf install abduco      ## fedora, redhat system
         sudo apt install abduco      ## debian based systems
         sudo pacman -S   abduco      ## arch based systems
         sudo pkg install abduco      ## freebsd system

    After you have  installed  abduco and luit you might  create a little  shell
    function or a shell script like this:
    
         #!/usr/bin/env bash
         ## file mecu 
         tty=$(tty | grep -Eo '[0-9]+')
         TERM=xterm abduco -A -e ^z mec$tty luit -encoding ISO559-15 mecb "$@"

    This little wrapper function will either attach an existing session on your
    current  terminal  or  create  a new one. You  might  replace  the  encoding
    ISO8859-15  with an encoding more  appropriate to your system. Make the file
    executable and move it to your bin folder.

cEcEQUESTION (50) cEcA

    How can I use other popular editor color themes in MicroEmacs?
    
    Importinng  other editor themes is not that  difficult. You can quite easily
    create  existing  color schemes for dark mode using the default color scheme
    "Default White on Black". If you go to the Github project page:
    https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes you find there downloads
    for the terminal 
    https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/blob/master/dynamic-colors
    as shell scripts and for an X11-session as xrdb-files.  
    
    For the terminal just choose the shell script of your choice and execute it before
    your start you MicroEmacs terminal version. You should use the standard MicroEmacs
    theme "Default White on Black" as it mostly compatible with the shell script themes.
    
    So a terminal session could look like this:
    
         source /path/to/neobones_light.sh    
         mecb  
    
    Usually  dark themes work better than light  themes.  Light themes only work
    with  the  default  theme if color 0 and 8 are set to light  colors.  If you
    background  is dark for a white  theme you can try out the  Scheme  "Termcap
    (White)" which fits quite nicely for light themes
     
    For the X11 GUI  MicroEmacs  a scheme file should be  generated.  There is a
    little shell script  xrdb2scheme.sh  in the Github bin folder which can be used
    to convert xrdb files into MicroEmacs color scheme code:
    
         bash bin/xrdb2scheme.sh  /path/to/xrdb-file
         
    will  print  out the  color  creation  code for a scheme  file. Use the file
    cGschemeat.emfcA  (the Artur theme) as template,  replace the color lines from
    color 1 to 21 with code printed to the  terminal,  give the theme a new name
    which is shown in the  description  part on top.  Color  1-16 are the  usual
    terminal  themes,  (black, red, green,  yellow,  blue,  purple, cyan, white)
    first full then bright versions, color 17 is the background  color, color 18
    is the foreground  color, color 19 is the cursor color, color 20 is the text
    selection  background  color  and color 21 is the text  selection  foregound
    color.
    
    Here an example session:
    
         $ bash bin/xrdb2scheme.sh ~/Downloads/Github-Dark.sh 
         add-color &set .col1 1 0 0 0          ; ansi color 0  (black) 
         add-color &set .col2 2 247 129 102    ; ansi color 1  (red)   
         add-color &set .col3 3 86 211 100     ; ansi color 2  (green) 
         add-color &set .col4 4 227 179 65     ; ansi color 3  (yellow)
         add-color &set .col5 5 108 164 248    ; ansi color 4  (blue)  
         add-color &set .col6 6 219 97 162     ; ansi color 5  (purple)
         add-color &set .col7 7 43 116 137     ; ansi color 6  (cyan)  
         add-color &set .col8 8 255 255 255    ; ansi color 7  (white) 
         add-color &set .col9 9 77 77 77       ; ansi color 8  (brightblack) 
         add-color &set .col10 10 247 129 102  ; ansi color 9  (brightred)   
         add-color &set .col11 11 86 211 100   ; ansi color 10 (brightgreen) 
         add-color &set .col12 12 227 179 65   ; ansi color 11 (brightyellow)
         add-color &set .col13 13 108 164 248  ; ansi color 12 (brightblue)  
         add-color &set .col14 14 219 97 162   ; ansi color 13 (brightpurple)
         add-color &set .col15 15 43 116 137   ; ansi color 14 (brightcyan)  
         add-color &set .col16 16 255 255 255  ; ansi color 15 (brightwhite)
         add-color &set .col17 17 16 18 22     ; background          
         add-color &set .col18 18 139 148 158  ; foreground         
         add-color &set .col19 19 201 209 217  ; cursor color       
         add-color &set .col20 20 59 80 112    ; selection background
         add-color &set .col21 21 255 255 255  ; selection foreground
      
    These color defintions could be placed in the color scheme file using
    one of the Ayu schemes (schemead.emf - dark theme, schemeale.emf - 
    light theme)  as templates. Usually there is then some tweaking 
    required aftwards in the lsscheme-editor(3)lmscheme-editor(3)le.
    
    You can as well create a function like cGscheme-github-darkcA
    in your cGusername.emfcA file where at the beginning you load  either 
    the schemefile cGschemead.emfcA or cGschemeal.emfcA files using the execute
    file command and at the end doing a screen-update. 
    So the code would look like this:
    
         define-macro scheme-github-dark
            execute-file "schemead"
            ... color codes from above
            screen-update
         !emacro
    
    You can then execute this function and get the color scheme in your 
    current editor session. Please note that this is then not a regular 
    scheme file, so the scheme can't be edited using the scheme-editor
    only by changing the colors in your cGusername.emfcA file.

    As an alternative you can since ME version 0924b2 directly load 
    rdb files without converting them into a ME scheme file. 
    See lsxrdb-scheme(3)lmxrdb-scheme(3)le for details.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDMicroEmacs 2009cA is a cut down version of the EMACS text editor, based on
    Daniel Lawrences MicroEmacs. cDMicroEmacs 2009cA is a tool for creating and
    changing documents, programs, and other text files. It is both relatively
    easy for the novice to use, but also very powerful in the hands of an
    expert. MicroEmacs 2009 can be extensively customized for the needs of the
    individual user.

    cDMicroEmacs 2009cA allows multiple files to be edited at the same time. The
    screen may be split into different windows and screens, and text may be
    moved freely from one window on any screen to the next. Depending on the
    type of file being edited, cDMicroEmacs 2009cA can change how it behaves to
    make editing simple. Editing standard text files, program files and word
    processing documents are all possible at the same time.

    There are extensive capabilities to make word processing and editing
    easier. These include commands for string searching and replacing,
    paragraph reformatting and deleting, automatic word wrapping, word move
    and deletes, easy case controlling, and automatic word counts.

    For complex and repetitive editing tasks editing macros can be written.
    These macros allow the user a great degree of flexibility in determining
    how cDMicroEmacs 2009cA behaves. Also, any and all the commands can be used by
    any key stroke by changing, or re-binding, what commands various keys
    invoke.

    Special features are also available to perform a diverse set of operations
    such as file encryption, automatic backup file generation, en-tabbing and
    de-tabbing lines, executing operating system commands and filtering of
    text through other programs.

    The command line options to cDMicroEmacs 2009cA are defined as follows:-

    @cDstartFilecA Initialize MicroEmacs 2009 using cCstartFilecA[cD.emfcA]. 
    
      The default when omitted is cDme.emfcA. See lsstart-up(3)lmstart-up(3)le and lsCommand Line FilterslmCommand Line Filtersle for more
      information.

    cD-cA Pipe cCstdincA into buffer cD*stdin*cA, when the buffer is saved the output is
      written cCstdoutcA. 
      
      Following is a simple example which changes cCcGacAcAs to cCcGbcAcAs:

sB
      define-macro start-up
          find-buffer "*stdin*"
          beginning-of-buffer
          replace-string "a" "b"
          save-buffer
          quick-exit
      !emacro
sA 
      This can be used in the following manner:

          me "@testpipe.emf" < foo.a > foo.b


      See cD-pcA for disabling user interaction and the help page for command
      lsml-write(2)lmml-write(2)le for a further example.

    cD-acA  Toggle the auto-save mode, this toggles the lsauto(2m)lmauto(2m)le mode.

       cDNote:cA that NanoEmacs disables auto save mode by default and MicroEmacs
       enables auto save mode by default. The behavior of cD-acA is therefore
       different between the two editors.

    cD-bcA  Load next file as a binary file (binary editor mode, uses lsbinary(2m)lmbinary(2m)le
       buffer mode).

    cD-BcA Toggle the backup mode, this toggles the lsbackup(2m)lmbackup(2m)le mode.

      cDNote:cA that NanoEmacs disables backup mode by default and MicroEmacs
      enables backup mode by default. The behavior of cD-BcA is therefore
      different between the two editors.

    cD-ccA[cCsessionNamecA] Continuation mode. 
    
      Load the cDMicroEmacs 2009cA last edit session,
      restoring the buffers to their previous loaded state when history mode
      is enabled. The cD-ccA option is generally used with windowing interfaces
      (X-Windows/Microsoft Windows) as the shortcut icon invocation.

      If the optional session name cCsessionNamecA is specified then the session
      file cCsessionNamecAcD.esfcA is loaded restoring the previous editing session
      including the buffer window size, position and layout, the buffer mark
      and cursor location, main window size. When the cCsessionNamecA includes
      space characters then the command line option should be bracketed e.g.
      `"-cFoo Bar"`. On a session restore then no additional files to load
      should be included on the command line as this will not enable the
      original window configuration to be restored as the window
      configuration will change. See lsread-session(3)lmread-session(3)le for further
      information.

      If the cCsessionNamecA is omitted then the default session file
      cCusernamecAcD.esfcA is loaded (see lsesf(8)lmesf(8)le) restoring the previously loaded
      buffers however the window layout and position is not restored. The
      default cCsessionNamecA is the login name ls$MENAME(5)lm$MENAME(5)le.

    cD-hcA Show the help page (does not start the editor).

    cD-icA MS-DOS versions of cDMicroEmacs 2009cA only. Insert the contents of the
     current screen into the cD*scratch*cA buffer

    cD-kcA[cCkeycA] Load next file as an encrypted file (uses lscrypt(2m)lmcrypt(2m)le buffer mode). 
    
      The optional adjoining argument can be used to specify the decrypting key,
      if this argument is not specify the user will be prompted for it on
      start-up.

    cD-lcA_lineNo_[cD:cA_column_] Go to line cClineNocA in the next given file and 
        optionally to the specified column number. 

      The column may be omitted if not required.
      typically used with utilities such a cDmore(1)cA where an external editor
      may be invoked from other viewer.

    cD-mcA*command* Sends a lsClient-Server(2)lmclient-serverle command to an existing MicroEmacs session. 
    
      The  command takes the form "cDC:cA*<client>:<command>*" i.e. 
      to write "Hello World" on the message line then a client may issue the command:-

           ; launch server
           me &
           ; send message
           me -m "C:ME:ml-write \"Hello world\""


      Note that the cC<command>cA is a MicroEmacs macro command, the escape
      sequences must be adhered to. The cCclient-servercA interface is typically
      used to load a file, this may be performed as follows:-

           me -m "C:myutility:find-file \"/path/foo.bar\""


      The absolute path is specified in this type of transaction as the
      current working directory of the active MicroEmacs session is unknown.
      The cD-mcA option de-iconize's the existing editor session and bring it to
      the foreground.

    cD-ncA Console mode

      UNIX X-Windows environments only and MicroSoft Windows NT console
      versions. Execute cDMicroEmacs 2009cA using termcap rather than X-Windows
      for UNIX; typically used within an cDxtermcA shell to fire up MicroEmacs
      2009 for a quick edit. For Microsoft Windows, a console window is
      started as opposed to a GUI window.

    cD-ocA*<file>* - use running version of ME
    
      Use already running version of MicroEmacs 2009 to load the cC<file>cA, if
      it exists, otherwise start a new editor session. This uses the
      cCclient-servercA interface to push the new file into the existing editor
      session. Refer to the lsClient-Server(2)lmClient-Server Interfacele for details.

    cD-pcA
      Used with the cD-cA which inputs from cCstdincA and disables user interaction
      within MicroEmacs. To debug then the cD-PcA option may be used to enable
      debug on cCstderrcA. See the help pages for commands lsml-write(2)lmml-write(2)le and
      lscommand-wait(2)lmcommand-wait(2)le for examples of this option's use.

    cD-PcA
    
      Used with the cD-pcA option and is used for debugging the pipe mode,
      lsml-write(2)lmml-write(2)le messages are displayed on stderr.

    cD-RcA
    
      Reverse the default video color scheme. The default foreground color
      becomes the background color and vice versa. This only affects the
      built in scheme and not any schemes defined in any start-up file.

    cD-rcA
    
      Read-only, all buffers will be in view mode

    cD-scA_string_
    
      Search for string "cCstringcA" in the current buffer. e.g. `me -sfoo bar`
      starts cDMicroEmacs 2009cA, loads file cGbarcA and initiates a search for cCfoocA.
      The cursor is left at the end of the string if located, otherwise at
      the top of the buffer.

    cD-ucA_username_
    
      Set the current user name ls$user-name(5)lm$user-name(5)le to cCusernamecA before MicroEmacs
      is initialized.

    cD-vcA_variable=string_
    
      Assign the MicroEmacs 2009 cCvariablecA with cCstringcA. The assignment is
      performed before the buffers are loaded. Typically used to change the
      start-up characteristics of the startup file(s).

    cD-VcA
    
      Print the name and version of MicroEmacs. i.e.

         `orac% me -V`
         `MicroEmacs 06 - Date 2006/08/10 - sunos`

    cD-xcA
    
      UNIX environments. Disable the capture of signals. cDMicroEmacs 2009cA by
      default captures an handles all illicit signal interrupts. The option
      is enabled when debugging the source code allowing exception
      conditions to be trapped within the debugger.

    cD-ycA
    
      Load next file as a reduced binary file (uses lsrbin(2m)lmrbin(2m)le buffer mode).


cEENVIRONMENT cA


    The following environment variables are used by cDMicroEmacs 2009cA.

    cDDISPLAYcA
    
      UNIX environments running X-Windows only. The identity of the
      X-Windows server. Typically set to cDunix:0.0cA, refer to the X-Windows
      documentation for details of this environment variable.

    cDMENAMEcA
    
      ls$MENAME(5)lm$MENAME(5)le is used to override the identity of the user ls$user-name(5)lm$user-name(5)le.
      The variable may be used to determine which start-up configuration to
      use in the initialization of cDMicroEmacs 2009cA (cC$user-namecA.erf). This is
      ignored if the cD-ucA option is specified on the command line.

      Non-UNIX platforms usually need to explicitly set the cD$MENAMEcA
      environment variable to identify the aforementioned files. for MS-DOS
      and early versions of Microsoft Windows this is typically performed in
      the cGAUTOEXEC.BATcA file.

    cDPATHcA
    
      The cD$PATHcA environment variable is used on most operating systems as a
      search path for executable files. This cD$PATHcA environment variable must
      be defined with cDMicroEmacs 2009cA on the search path. Under UNIX this is
      set in the cG.logincA, cG.cshrccA or cG.profilecA file i.e.

            export PATH $PATH:/usr/name/me

      Within MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows environments it is defined in the
      cGAUTOEXEC.BATcA file. e.g.

            set PATH=%PATH%;c:\me

      cDMicroEmacs 2009cA utilizes information in the cD$PATHcA environment variable
      to locate the start-up files, dictionaries etc.

    cDTERMcA
    
      The terminal identification sting. In UNIX environments the
      environment variable cD$TERMcA is set to cGcGvt...cAcA, in this case it is
      assumed that the machine is a server, and the host cannot support X
      (see command line option cD-ncA).

      In MS-DOS the environment variable is usually set to define the
      graphics adapter mode. cD%TERMcA is assigned a string, understood by the
      cGme.emfcA start-up file, to set the graphics mode. Predefined strings
      include:-

       cDE80x50cA  
    
       Initiates an 80 column by 50 line screen.

       cDE80x25cA  
    
       Initiates an 80 column by 25 line screen.

       cCuserDefinedcA  
    
       A user defined string to set an explicit graphics card mode. The
       operation is dependent upon the support offered by the graphics
       adapter.

    cDMEINSTALLPATHcA
    
      ls$MEINSTALLPATH(5)lm$MEINSTALLPATH(5)le is an environment variable that overrides any
      internally defined search path for MicroEmacs system macros and
      defines the root directory(s) of the MicroEmacs system macros. The
      presence of the environment variable affects ls$search-path(5)lm$search-path(5)le.

    cDMEUSERPATHcA
    
      ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le is an environment variable that defines the users
      private directory where user configuration files such as
      ls$user-name(5)lm$user-namele.emf, ls$user-name(5)lm$user-namele.erf and personal spelling dictionaries are
      stored. This is an absolute directory path. The environment variable
      sets the MicroEmacs variable ls$user-path(5)lm$user-path(5)le.

    cDMEPATHcA
    
      ls$MEPATH(5)lm$MEPATH(5)le is an environment variable that may be used to define the
      absolute search path for MicroEmacs macro files and affects the
      setting of cD$search-pathcA. The path should include the system macros
      location(s) and should include the user directory location
      ls$user-path(5)lm$user-path(5)le as the first path when the environment variable
      ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le is not defined. If $MEUSERPATH is defined then this
      path name appears before the cD$MEPATHcA variable to define the user
      directory location. cD$MEPATHcA is not searching, so ALL directories to be
      searched must be included in the path specification.

      ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le is the preferred method used to defined the user
       directory.

    cDINFOPATHcA
    
      MicroEmacs 2009 uses the environment variable cD$INFOPATHcA as the
      directory(s) used to search for GNU cDInfocA files. Within the UNIX
      cD$INFOPATHcA is a semi-colon separated list of directories which are used
      to search for the MicroEmacs 2009 macro files. The path is searched
      from left to right. The environment variable is typically defined in
      the in the cG.logincA, cG.cshrccA or cG.profilecA file i.e.

            export INFOPATH /usr/local/info:$HOME/info

      The default when omitted is cG/usr/local/infocA.

      Within MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows environments it is defined in the
      cGAUTOEXEC.BATcA file. e.g.

            set MEPATH=c:\usr\local\info

      There is no default location in these environments. For Microsoft
      Windows environments refer to lsme32.ini(8)lmme32.ini(8)le for a method of setting up

    All of the macro files and dictionaries are located in the cDMicroEmacscA home
    directory. The standard file extensions that are utilized are:-

    cD.eafcA
    
       cDMicroEmacs 2009cA abbreviation file, defines completion definitions for
       buffer dependent text expansion.

    cD.edfcA
    
       A cDMicroEmacs 2009cA spelling dictionary. cC<language>cDcA.edfcA provide language
       specific dictionaries; cC$LOGNAMEcAcD.edfcA is personal spelling dictionary.

    cD.ehfcA   
    
       cDMicroEmacs 2009cA help file information. On-line help information for
       emacs, the main file is cGme.ehfcA.

    cD.emfcA
    
       A cDMicroEmacs 2009cA macro file. The following classes of macro file
       exist:

       cDme.emfcA
    
       The default startup file.

      <platform>.emf_
      A platform specify startup file, these include UNIX generic
         (unixterm.emf), UNIX specific (irix.emf, hpux.emf, unixwr1.emf,
         linux.emf, sunos.emf etc), Microsoft Windows (win32.emf), MS-DOS
         (dos.emf).

       cDhkxxxxxx.emfcA
    
       Buffer context specific hook files to initialize a buffer with
       macros and highlighting appropriate to the contents of the file
       type. e.g. 'C' language editing (hkc.emf), N/Troff typesetting
       (hknroff.emf), UNIX Manual page display (hkman.emf), Makefiles
       (hkmake.emf), etc.

    cD.erfcA

cEMICROSOFT WINDOWS cA


    Microsoft Windows environments should refer to lsme32.ini(8)lmme32.ini(8)le for a method of
    setting up the environment variables without editing the cGAUTOEXEC.BATcA
    configuration file.

    Drag and drop support is provided in the Windowing version of MicroEmacs.
    The editor window is brought into focus following the drop.


cEUNIX cA


    Xdnd drag and drop support is provided in the X-Windows version of
    MicroEmacs. The editor window is not raised or brought into focus
    following the drop as expected in the UNIX environment.


cESESSIONS cA


    Reading a session is generally performed when a MicroEmacs session is
    started using the "cD-ccA" command line option rather than from the mode line
    or main menu, see lsread-session(3)lmread-session(3)le. Invoking

    cDme -ccA*<mySessionName>*

      where cC<mySessionName>cA is the name of the session (the ls$MENAME(5)lm$MENAME(5)le or system
      login name) will restore all of of the buffers, windows layout, point and
      mark positions, main window size etc. at the point of the last shut down.
      e.g. given a system login name of cCjasspacA then

    cDme -ccA*jasspa*

      restores the session to the state when cCjasspacA last exited MicroEmacs. When
      the session name is specified then no other files should be specified, so
      the command line

    cDme -ccAcCjasspacA cGmorefiles.txtcA

      restores the buffers but does not restore the window layout because this
      has been destroyed by the introduction of the new file cGcGmorefiles.txtcAcA.
     This type of command with another file behaves as the old cG`me -c`cA command
     prior to the 2006 release that did not support sessions. If
     cC<mySessionName>cA is not specified then the buffers are restored but the
     window layout is not restored.


cEHISTORY cA


    The 2006 release removed the cG-dcA command line option for debugging (not
    used) and added session support by extending the cG-ccA option with an
    optional cCsessionNamecA argument.

    In 2021 Detlef Groth joined the maintainer team and adds a Github repository
    at https://github.com/mittelmark/microemacs
 
    The 2023 release adds an alternative screen buffer option -A

cEcENAME cEcA


    memsdev - Microsoft Developer Studio Add-in for MicroEmacs 2009


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDmemsdev.dllcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDmeMsdevcA is a Microsoft Visual Studio Add-In that allows MicroEmacs 2009 to
    be integrated as the default text editor. It will be used instead of the
    Visual Studio built in editor when you double click on a file or press F4.

    cDmeMsdevcA may not be supplied built and should be built using Microsoft
    Developer Studio.


cEINSTALLATION cA


    cD1)cA Copy mesdev.dll into the MicroEmacs directory i.e.

         c:/Program Files/JASSPA/MicroEmacs


    cD2)cA Edit the lsme32.ini(8)lmme32.ini(8)le file in your Windows directory and identify the
    location of the MicroEmacs executable. The executable name is used to
    spawn MicroEmacs if it is not already running. The entry takes the form:-

         ; Identify the location of the MicroEmacs executable so that the
         ; Developer Studio "Add-In" can locate the executable
         [Location]
         exe=c:\Program Files\JASSPA\MicroEmacs\me32.exe


    Change the cCexecA entry to match the location and name of your executable.

    cD3)cA For MS-DEV V5.0 only; from a DOS box, register the DLL using
     cDregsvr32.exe(1)cA i.e.

         > cd c:/Program Files/JASSPA/MicroEmacs
         > regsvr32 memsdev.dll


    For MS-DEV V6.0 it is not necessary to perform this registration step.

    cD4)cA Start Visual Studio and goto:-

          Tools
              Customize...
                  Add-Ins and Macro Files


    cD5)cA Click on cCBrowsecA and point Visual Studio to your cDmemsdev.dllcA file.

    cD6)cA Click the check box to indicate that you want to use the Add-In, and
    close the Customize dialog box.

    cD7)cA You should notice the MicroEmacs tool bar showing the MicroEmacs Icon.
    This invokes a dialog that allows you to attach and detach MicroEmacs as
    the default editor.


cEUSING meMsdev cA


    Clicking on the MicroEmacs Tool bar shows the meMsdev configuration
    dialog. Check the boxes when MicroEmacs edit session is required as
    default; uncheck the boxes if you wish to revert to the built-in dialog.

    Use Visual Studio as normal, and MicroEmacs should almost always bring
    MicroEmacs to the foreground to edit the document. If a MicroEmacs is
    already running then "meMsdev" will attach to an existing session and will
    load the file. If MicroEmacs is not detected then a new version is spawned
    off and then an attachment is made.


cERUNNING A DEBUG SESSION cA


    cDmeMsdevcA does not currently provide any debugging capability (but we are
    working on it !!). To start debugging it is suggested that the Editor is
    decoupled cC(MicroEmacs Dialogue -> Uncheck Boxes)cA and work within the
    Developer studio.

    When you have finished debugging and wish to move back to an edit session
    then re-enable MicroEmacs cC(MicroEmacs Dialogue -> Check Boxes)cA AND close
    any windows that are open within the MS-Dev environment (
    cCWindow->Windows...->Select AllcA and cCClose All WindowscA). Then commence
    editing again.

    While MicroEmacs is attached, selecting any of the find file lines,
    compilation error lines etc within the response panes will take MicroEmacs
    to the specified line.


cEBUGS cA


    cDmeMsdevcA works by hooks exposed by Visual Studio. Most of the functionality
    works from the OpenDocument (look it up in VS 5) hook. So...If a document
    is ALREADY open in Visual Studio, and you double click the file in the
    File Browser...Emacs will NOT come to the foreground. Since the document
    was open in the Visual Studio editor, the OpenDocument event never
    occurred.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDNanoEmacs 2009cA is a cut down version of cDMicroEmacs 2009cA EMACS text editor,
    based on Danial Lawrences MicroEmacs.

    cDNanoEmacs 2009cA provides the basic EMACS editor functions, allowing
    multiple files to be edited at the same time. The screen may be split into
    different windows and screens, and text may be moved freely from one
    window on any screen to the next. The editor typically runs in a console
    mode and is set up for basic system administration work or system bring
    up, macro files are not expected to be present, the system is still
    capable of running a macro file (with limited capability), the default
    start-up file is cGne.emfcA and is executed at start-up if present.

    The command line options to cDNanoEmacs 2009cA are defined as follows:-

    cD@cA_startFile_
    
       Initialize NanoEmacs 2009 using cCstartFilecA[cD.emfcA]. The default when
       omitted is cDne.emfcA. See lsstart-up(3)lmstart-up(3)le and lsCommand Line FilterslmCommand Line Filtersle for more
       information.

    cD-acA
    
      Toggle the auto-save mode, this toggles the lsauto(2m)lmauto(2m)le mode.

        cDNote:cA that NanoEmacs disables auto save mode by default and MicroEmacs
        enables auto save mode by default. The behavior of cD-acA is therefore
        different between the two editors.

    cD-bcA

        Load next file as a binary file (binary editor mode, uses lsbinary(2m)lmbinary(2m)le
        buffer mode).

    cD-BcA

       Toggle the backup mode, this toggles the lsbackup(2m)lmbackup(2m)le mode.

        cDNote:cA that NanoEmacs disables backup mode by default and MicroEmacs
        enables backup mode by default. The behavior of cD-BcA is therefore
        different between the two editors.

    cD-ccA

       Continuation mode. Load cDNanoEmacs 2009cA last edit session, restoring
       the buffers to their previous loaded state and position. Note that
       history mode must be enabled. The cD-ccA option is generally used with
       windowing interfaces (X-Windows/Microsoft Windows) as the shortcut
       icon invocation.

    cD-hcA

       Show the help page (does not start the editor).

    cD-kcA[cCkeycA]

       Load next file as an encrypted file (uses lscrypt(2m)lmcrypt(2m)le buffer mode). The
       optional adjoining argument can be used to specify the decrypting key,
       if this argument is not specify the user will be prompted for it on
       start-up.

    cD-lcA_lineNo_

       Go to line cClineNocA in the next given file and optionally to the
       specified column number. The column may be omitted if not required.
       Typically used with utilities such a cDmore(1)cA where an external editor
       may be invoked from other viewer.

    cD-ncA

       UNIX X-Windows environments only and MicroSoft Windows NT console
       versions. Execute cDMicroEmacs 2009cA using termcap rather than X-Windows
       for UNIX; typically used within an cDxtermcA shell to fire up MicroEmacs
       2009 for a quick edit. For Microsoft Windows, a console window is
       started as opposed to a GUI window. This option is not present if a
       console version of the application has been built.

    cD-RcA

       Reverse the default video color scheme. The default foreground color
       becomes the background color and vice versa. This only affects the
       built in scheme and not any schemes defined in any start-up file.

    cD-rcA

       Read-only, all buffers will be in view mode

    cD-scA_string_

       Search for string "cCstringcA" in the current buffer. e.g. `ne -sfoo bar`
       starts cDMicroEmacs 2009cA, loads file cGbarcA and initiates a search for cCfoocA.
       The cursor is left at the end of the string if located, otherwise at
       the top of the buffer.

    cD-ucA_username_

       Set the current user name ls$user-name(5)lm$user-name(5)le to cCusernamecA before NanoEmacs
       is initialized.

    cD-vcA_variable=string_

       Assign the MicroEmacs 2009 cCvariablecA with cCstringcA. The assignment is
       performed before the buffers are loaded. Typically used to change the
       start-up characteristics of the startup file(s).

    cD-VcA

       Print the name and version of NanoEmacs. i.e.

          `orac% ne -V`
          `NanoEmacs 05 - Date 2005/02/24 - sunos`

    cD-xcA

       UNIX environments. Disable the capture of signals. cDMicroEmacs 2009cA by
       default captures an handles all illicit signal interrupts. The option
       is enabled when debugging the source code allowing exception
       conditions to be trapped within the debugger.

    cD-ycA

       Load next file as a reduced binary file (uses lsrbin(2m)lmrbin(2m)le buffer mode).


cEENVIRONMENT cA


    The following environment variables are used by cDNanoEmacs 2009cA.

    cDDISPLAYcA

       UNIX environments running X-Windows only. The identity of the
       X-Windows server. Typically set to cDunix:0.0cA, refer to the X-Windows
       documentation for details of this environment variable.

    cDMENAMEcA

       ls$MENAME(5)lm$MENAME(5)le is used to override the identity of the user ls$user-name(5)lm$user-name(5)le.
       The variable may be used to determine which start-up configuration to
       use in the initialization of cDMicroEmacs 2009cA (cC$user-namecA.erf). This is
       ignored if the cD-ucA option is specified on the command line.

       Non-UNIX platforms usually need to explicitly set the cD$MENAMEcA
       environment variable to identify the aforementioned files. for MS-DOS
       and early versions of Microsoft Windows this is typically performed in
       the cGAUTOEXEC.BATcA file.

    cDPATHcA

       The cD$PATHcA environment variable is used on most operating systems as a
       search path for executable files. This cD$PATHcA environment variable must
       be defined with cDMicroEmacs 2009cA on the search path. Under UNIX this is
       set in the cG.logincA, cG.cshrccA or cG.profilecA file i.e.

              export PATH $PATH:/usr/name/ne

       Within MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows environments it is defined in the
       cGAUTOEXEC.BATcA file. e.g.

              set PATH=%PATH%;c:\ne

       cDMicroEmacs 2009cA utilizes information in the cD$PATHcA environment variable
       to locate the start-up files, dictionaries etc.

    cDTERMcA

       The terminal identification sting. In UNIX environments the
       environment variable cD$TERMcA is set to cGcGvt...cAcA, in this case it is
       assumed that the machine is a server, and the host cannot support X
       (see command line option cD-ncA).

       In MS-DOS the environment variable is usually set to define the
       graphics adapter mode. cD%TERMcA is assigned a string, understood by the
       cGme.emfcA start-up file, to set the graphics mode. Predefined strings
       include:-

       cDE80x50cA  
    
               Initiates an 80 column by 50 line screen.

       cDE80x25cA  
    
               Initiates an 80 column by 25 line screen.

        cCuserDefinedcA
    
              A user defined string to set an explicit graphics card mode. The
              operation is dependent upon the support offered by the graphics
              adapter.

    cDMEINSTALLPATHcA

       ls$MEINSTALLPATH(5)lm$MEINSTALLPATH(5)le is an environment variable that overrides any
       internally defined search path for NanoEmacs system macros and defines
       the root directory(s) of the NanoEmacs system macros. The presence of
       the environment variable affects ls$search-path(5)lm$search-path(5)le.

    cDMEUSERPATHcA

       ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le is an environment variable that defines the users
       private directory where user configuration files such as
       ls$user-name(5)lm$user-namele.emf, ls$user-name(5)lm$user-namele.erf and personal spelling dictionaries are
       stored. This is an absolute directory path. The environment variable
       sets the NanoEmacs variable ls$user-path(5)lm$user-path(5)le.

    cDMEPATHcA

       ls$MEPATH(5)lm$MEPATH(5)le is an environment variable that may be used to define the
       absolute search path for NanoEmacs macro files and affects the setting
       of cD$search-pathcA. The path should include the system macros location(s)
       and should include the user directory location ls$user-path(5)lm$user-path(5)le as the
       first path when the environment variable ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le is not
       defined. If cD$MEUSERPATHcA is defined then this path name appears before
       the cD$MEPATHcA variable to define the user directory location. cD$MEPATHcA is
       not searching, so ALL directories to be searched must be included in
       the path specification.

       ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le is the preferred method used to defined the user
       directory.


cEFILES cA


    All of the macro files and dictionaries are located in the cDNanoEmacscA home
    directory. The standard file extensions that are utilized are:-

    cD.emfcA

        A cDMicroEmacs 2009cA macro file. The following classes of macro file
       exist:

       cDne.emfcA

               The default startup file.


cEMICROSOFT WINDOWS cA


    Microsoft Windows environments should refer to lsme32.ini(8)lmme32.ini(8)le for a method of

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDadd-colorcA creates a new color and inserts it into MicroEmacs 2009 colors
    table, where cCredcA, cCgreencA and cCbluecA are the color components and cCcol-nocA is
    the MicroEmacs 2009 color table number. The color table contains 256
    entries indexed by cCcol-nocA in the range 0-255.

    On some platforms (DOS and UNIX termcap) the number of colors is
    physically limited by the hardware to less than 256 (typically 16), in
    this case all 256 colors can be defined and for each created color the
    closest system color is used.

    By default, only color 0 (white) and 1 (black) are defined. Once created,
    the colors may be used to create color schemes, this is the sole use of
    colors.

    cDadd-colorcA may be used to modify an existing cCcol-nocA index by re-assignment,
    the existing color definition is over-written with the new color
    definition. 
    
    cDadd-color-schemecA creates a color scheme entry used by
    lshilight(2)lmhilight(2)le, lsscreen-poke(2)lmscreen-poke(2)le, lsosd(2)lmosd(2)le and variables such as
    ls$global-scheme(5)lm$global-scheme(5)le, ls$buffer-scheme(5)lm$buffer-scheme(5)le, ls$ml-scheme(5)lm$ml-scheme(5)le.

    The command takes an index number "cCschemeNumcA" and eight color values
    (defined by cDadd-colorcA) alternating between foreground and background
    colors. The 8 colors represent the 4 color paired states of foreground and
    background that may appear in a text buffer. The paired states correspond
    to current and selected lines (or permutations thereof). If an argument cCncA
    is given to the command then cCschemeNumcA is set to a duplicate of the cCncAth
    scheme, no other arguments are required.

    cCschemeNumcA is the identifying index that is used to recognize the scheme.
    By default only two color schemes are defined at initialization, they are
    a monochrome scheme and inverse scheme with indices 0 and 1 using white as
    foreground and black as background, selected text is inverted. When
    defining a color scheme, if an existing cCschemeNumcA index is used then that
    scheme is modified.

    The next eight arguments must be given, they specify foreground and
    background color pairs for the four different situations, as follows:-

    Default    
    
        Color combination used when none of the following three are
        applicable.

    Current
 
        Color combination used when the text is on the same line as the
        cursor. It is also used by the ls$mode-line-scheme(5)lm$mode-line-scheme(5)le for the current
        window's mode line and for the current selection on an lsosd(2)lmosd(2)le dialog.

    Selected
 
        Color combination used when the text is in the current selected
        region, but is not on the current line. Also used by cDosdcA for
        non-current item Hot keys.

    Current-selected
 
         Color combination used when the text is on the current line and in the
        current selected region. Also used by cDosdcA for the current item's Hot
        key.

    The following 8 arguments set up fonts and are optional, any missing
    arguments are defaulted to 0. Each argument is a bitmask indicating which
    font should be enabled, where each bit is as follows:

         `0x01` Enable bold font.
         `0x02` Enable italic font.
         `0x04` Enable light font.
         `0x08` Enable reverse font.
         `0x10` Enable underlining.

    Normally only the foreground value is used, i.e. the first, third, fifth
    and seventh values. But lsscreen-poke(2)lmscreen-poke(2)le can be used to draw reversed color
    scheme in which case the background values are used.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The color palette is typically created at start-up via the configuration
    file cDschemecAcCXcAcD.emfcA. These files are not easily read as they are
    automatically generated via the lsscheme-editor(3)lmscheme-editor(3)le dialog. A more readable
    form of cGcGschemed.emfcAcA would be as follows:-

cENOTES cA


    Color schemes can be created and altered using the lsscheme-editor(3)lmscheme-editor(3)le
    dialog, the created color scheme can then the used from start-up by using
    the lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le dialog. Therefore direct use of these commands is
    largely redundant.

    The existence of a color or scheme index is checked as each entry is
    submitted, therefore any color or scheme used must have been previously
    been created, otherwise a default value is substituted.

    Changing any existing color definitions causes all references to the color
    from a scheme to adopt the new color.

    Changing any existing color-scheme definitions changes the rendered color
    of any lshilight(2)lmhilight(2)le etc., that was using that color-scheme.

    A negative color scheme value (i.e. cC-ncA) uses the previous 'cCncA'th entry that
    is defined in the color block. i.e. if cCcurrent-forecA was specified as -2
    then it would inherit the cCforecA field color.

    Not all UNIX terminals support all the above fonts.

    On some telnet packages color is not directly supported and some of the
    termcap display attributes such as bold and italic are represented by a
    color (e.g. italic text is shown in green). Using this translation it is
    possible to achieve reasonable color support on a VT100 terminal - it is a
    little awkward but is worth while if you have to use this type of
    connection frequently.

    add-dictionary - Declare existence of a spelling dictionary
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDadd-dictionarycA "cCfilecA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDadd-dictionarycA adds the given dictionary (specified by the given cCfilecA) to
    the dictionary list. Note that the cCfilecA may omit the cD.edfcA extension, this
    is automatically added.

    The command accepts a numeric argument 'cCncA' which determines the actions to
    be undertaken. When cCncA is omitted then the dictionary is marked for loading
    (on demand) - this is the standard invocation used in the start up files.

    If an argument of cD0cA is given the dictionary is created but it is not
    marked for loading, this can be used to create an empty dictionary.

    If an argument of cD-1cA is given the contents of the dictionary are dumped
    into the current buffer, used for dictionary maintenance. The two main
    uses of this command are discussed below.


cEDictionary Loading  cA


    A call to cDadd-dictionarycA with no numeric argument does not perform an
    immediate load of the dictionary, instead the dictionary is only loaded on
    demand, i.e. when a call to lsspell(2)lmspell(2)le (usually via lsspell-word(3)lmspell-word(3)le or
    lsspell-buffer(3)lmspell-buffer(3)le) is made, this ensures that the start up time for
    MicroEmacs does not become too long. When the dictionary is loaded it is
    checked for efficiency, if found to be inefficient it is automatically
    optimized and flagged as changed. On exiting MicroEmacs, the user is
    prompted to save any dictionary that has be altered or optimized.

    The spelling search order is made from the last dictionary added to the
    first, as soon as a word is found in a dictionary the search is halted.
    This implies that if a word has been defined incorrectly in one
    dictionary, but correct in another, the order in which the dictionaries
    are added determines the result.

    The number of dictionaries allowed is unlimited but note that any words
    added are always added to the LAST dictionary. The size of the dictionary
    is restricted to about 16Mb, the size is NOT tested when words are added
    and if this size is exceeded the results are undefined. However, it is
    unlikely that this limit will be reached, the largest dictionary created
    to date is 0.8Mb.

    A new main dictionary may be created as follows:-

    cD1)cA
      Find a file containing an cDispell(1)cA compatible list of words.

    cD2)cA
      lsexecute-file(2)lmexecute-file(2)le spellutl.emf to define macro lsspell-add-word(3)lmspell-add-word(3)le.

    cD3)cA
       Start up MicroEmacs 2009 and execute the command cDadd-dictionarycA giving
       an appropriate new dictionary name.

    cD4)cA
       Load up the file containing the words and execute the command
      lsspell-add-word(3)lmspell-add-word(3)le with a very large argument so all the words are
       added.

    cD5)cA
       Save the dictionary by either executing the command lssave-dictionary(2)lmsave-dictionary(2)le
       or exiting.


cEDictionary Dump  cA


    A call to cDadd-dictionarycA with a numeric argument cCncA of -1 causes the
    contents of the given dictionary to be dumped into the current buffer
    (make sure you are in an empty buffer or cD*scratch*cA) where:

         `xxxx` - Good word `xxxx` with no spell rules allowed
         `xxxx/abc` - Good word `xxxx` with spell rules `abc` allowed
         `xxxx>yyyy` - Erroneous word with an auto-replace to `yyyy`

    The dump of the dictionary may be edited, allowing erroneous entries to be
    removed. The macro file cGspellutl.emfcA contains macros lsedit-dictionary(3)lmedit-dictionary(3)le
    and lsrestore-dictionary(3)lmrestore-dictionary(3)le which enable the user to edit a dictionary.


cENOTES cA


    MicroEmacs 2009 is supplied with a dictionaries for American and British
    English, it is strongly suggested that these dictionaries are cDNOTcA modified
    in anyway. Ensure that the dictionary is protected by loading the base
    dictionaries first, followed by a personal dictionary. New words added
    during spelling will then be added to the personal dictionary rather than
    the main dictionary.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The MicroEmacs 2009 start-up file cDme.emfcA executes cDlanguage.emfcA which in
    turn executes the user language setup file, for example cDamerican.emfcA,
    which adds the main language dictionaries and rules. cDlanguage.emfcA then
    adds the user's dictionary, this process can be simplified to:-

sB
          ; add the main American dictionary
          add-dictionary "lsdmenus"

          ; reset the spell rules
          0 add-spell-rule
          ; Now add the American spell rules
          -2 add-spell-rule "A" "" "" "re" ; As in enter > reenter
          -2 add-spell-rule "I" "" "" "in" ; As in disposed > indisposed
              .
              .

! 2 add-file-hook
cEcENAME cEcA


    add-file-hook - Declare file name context dependent configuration
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDadd-file-hookcA "cCextensionscA" "cCfhook-namecA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDadd-file-hookcA defines a macro binding between a file name or file type and
    a set of macros. This binding enables file type dependent screen
    highlighting and key bindings to be performed. For a higher level
    introduction refer to lsfileHooks(2)lmFile Hooksle.

    cDadd-file-hookcA operates in two different modes to establish the type of file:-

    - Content recognition, by examination of the contents of the file.
    - File extension recognition.

    Content recognition has the highest priority and is used in preference to
    the file extension.

    cDadd-file-hookcA is called multiple times to add new recognition rules. The
    rules are interrogated in last-in-first-out (LIFO) order, hence the
    extension added last has a greater precedence than those added first. This
    ordering allows default rules to be over-ridden.


cEInitialization  cA


    cDadd-file-hookcA must be initialized prior to the first call, using an
    invocation of the form:-

sB
          0 add-file-hook

sA
    with a numeric argument cCncA of 0, and no arguments. This invocation resets
    the file hooks by deleting all of the installed hooks.


cEFile Extension Recognition  cA


    cDadd-file-hookcA with no numerical argument cCncA allows the extension of a file
    (or the base file name if there is no extension) to be used to determine
    which user defined setup macro is to be executed. The cCextensionscA argument
    is a space separated list of cCfile endingscA (as opposed to true extensions)
    and is usually specified with the extension separator. For example, the
    extension cGcG.doccAcA may indicate that the file is a document and therefore
    the lsindent(2m)lmindentle, lswrap(2m)lmwraple and lsjustify(2m)lmjustifyle buffer modes are required. This may be
    performed automatically by defining a macro which adds these modes and
    adding a file hook to automatically execute this macro whenever a file
    cGcG*.doccAcA is loaded.

    The command arguments are defined as follows:-

    cCextensionscA
    
       A space separated list of file extensions, which are to be checked,
       this list includes the extension separator (typically dot (cCcG.cAcA). It
       should be noted that the extension search is actually a comparison of
       the tail of the string, as such files such as cCmakefilecA, which do not
       have an extension, are specified literally.

    cCfhook-namecA
    
       The name of the file hook to execute. This is the name of the macro to
       execute that initializes the buffer.

    As an example:-

sB
          define-macro fhook-doc
              1 buffer-mode "indent"
              1 buffer-mode "wrap"
              1 buffer-mode "justify"
          !emacro

          add-file-hook ".doc" "fhook-doc"

sA    It is quite possible that the same macro should be executed for a text
    file, i.e. cGcG*.txtcAcA this is achieved by a single cDadd-file-hookcA as the space
    (' ') character is used as an extension separator, e.g.

sB
          add-file-hook ".doc .txt" "fhook-doc"

sA    There are three special file hooks, which are cDfhook-binarycA, cDfhook-rbincA and
    cDfhook-defaultcA, these are not predefined, but if the user defines them then
    they are executed whenever a file is loaded in lsbinary(2m)lmbinaryle or lsrbin(2m)lmreduced binaryle
    mode (see lsbuffer-mode(2)lmbuffer-mode(2)le) or the extension does not match any of those
    defined.

    Considering the cGfhook-XXXcA prefix, the initial 'cCcCfcAcA' character must be
    present as this is changed to a 'cDbcD' and an 'cAecA' when looking for the enter
    (begin) buffer and exit buffer hooks. These hooks are executed whenever
    the user swaps to or from a buffer (including creating and deleting). So
    for the given example, if the fill ignore characters are to be changed
    then this operation this is performed by defining the cGbhook-XXXcA and
    cGehook-XXXcA macros, e.g.:-

sB
          ; Begin hook - entering the buffer - save the current fill-ignore characters
          define-macro bhook-java
              !if &exi .fhook-java.fill-ignore
                  set-variable .fhook-java.ofill-ignore $fill-ignore
                  set-variable $fill-ignore .fhook-java.fill-ignore
              !endif
          !emacro

          ; End hook - leaving the buffer - restore the fill-ignore characters
          define-macro ehook-java
              !if &exi .fhook-java.fill-ignore
                  set-variable $fill-ignore .fhook-java.ofill-ignore
              !endif
          !emacro

          ; Fix up the $fill-mode so that we wrap java doc parameters. Do this by
          ; removing the "@" from the $fill-ignore variable.
          !if &sin "@" $fill-ignore
              set-variable .fhook-java.fill-ignore $fill-ignore
              set-variable .fhook-java.fill-ignore &rep .fhook-java.fill-ignore "@" ""
          !endif

sA
    File hooks are often used to setup the desired cCbuffer modescA, cChilightingcA,
    cClocal key bindingscA, cCabbreviation filecA, etc.

    Buffer hooks are usually used to set and restore conflicting global
    variables.


cEFile Content Recognition  cA

    cDadd-file-hookcA with a non-zero numerical argument cCncA defines a macro binding
    between the content in a file and a set of macros. This binding enables
    file type dependent screen hi-lighting and key binding to be performed.
    For a full description of file hooks refer to lsfileHooks(2)lmFile Hooksle, for file
    extension dependent hooking refer to lsadd-file-hook(2)lmadd-file-hook(2)le.

    The content defined file hooks interrogate the contents of a file on
    loading and search for a cCmagiccA string identifier embedded in the text
    which uniquely identifies the file type.

    The recognition process performs a search of the first cCncA (numerical
    argument) non-blank lines of the file, searching for the regular
    expression specified by the cCextensionscA argument. The sign of the numerical
    argument cCncA is interpreted as follows:-

    - cD-vecA - Case insensitive search
    - cD+vecA - Case sensitive search

    The command arguments are defined as follows:-

    cCextensionscA 

      A regular expression string defining the text to be searched for.

    cCfhook-namecA 

       The name of the file hook to execute. This is the name of the macro to
       execute that will initialize the buffer.

    The search commences from the first non-blank line in the file, if the
    regular expression, defined by cCextensionscA is located then the file hook
    cCfhook-namecA is invoked. This is typically used to identify files which do
    not have file extensions i.e. UNIX shell script files. To identify a shell
    script file which commences with:-

          #!/bin/sh


    The following file hook is used:-

    cD1 add-file-hookcA "cD#!/.*shcA" "cDfhook-shellcA"

    Note that cGcG.*shcAcA also matches cG/bin/cshcA, cG/usr/local/bin/zshcA etc, so care
    should be taken to ensure that the regular expression string is
    sufficiently well specified to recognize the file type.

    The second class of embedded text are explicit identifiers embedded into
    the text. The embedded strings take the form:

       `-*-` _mode_ `-*`  
       `-*-` __Mode:__ _mode_; ... `-*-`  
       `-!-` _mode_ `-!-`  

    The cG-*-cA notation belongs to GNU Emacs, but MicroEmacs 2009 recognizes the
    construct and extracts the string correctly. The cG-!-cA notation is
    MicroEmacs 2009 specific and is provided so as not to cause conflict with
    GNU Emacs. MicroEmacs 2009 searches for either construct on the first
    non-blank line of the file.

    The explicit strings are defined with a negative numerical argument cCncA,
    which identifies them as cDexplicitcA rather than cDmagiccA text strings. The
    cCstringcA should be defined in lower case and matches a case insensitive
    string take from the file. e.g. to define a file hook for a make file:

          #_____________________________-!-Makefile-!-________________________________
          #
          # Make file for MicroEmacs using the Microsoft MSCV 2.0/4.0 development kit.

          # File        : makefile.w32
          ....


    might be defined as:

    -1 cDadd-file-hookcA "-!-[ \t]*makefile.*-!-" fhook-make


cENOTES cA


cEAutomatic Macro File Loading  cA


    cDadd-file-hookcA performs an automatic load of a macro file if the cDfhookcA
    macro is not present in memory. The file name of the command file
    containing the macro is automatically derived from the cCnamecA component of
    the cDfhookcA macro name. The cDfhook-cA part of the name is stripped off and
    prepended with cDhkcA and suffixed with cD.emfcA. Hence, macro cDfhook-doccA would be
    searched for in file cGhkdoc.emfcA within the MicroEmacs 2009 directory. The
    command file is automatically loaded and executed.

    In cases where the fhook macro is not located in an equivalent hook file,
    the file location of the macro may be explicitly defined for auto loading
    via a lsdefine-macro-file(2)lmdefine-macro-file(2)le invocation.

    As an example, consider the C-mode file hook, used to load cG.ccA files. The
    loading of a C header file (cG.hcA) utilizes the same highlighting modes, but
    it's startup sequence is slightly different when handling new files. In
    this case the cDfhook-cmodecA for cG.ccA and cDfhook-hmodecA for cG.hcA files are located
    in the same hook file namely cGhkcmode.emfcA.

sB
          define-macro-file hkcmode fhook-hmode

          add-file-hook ".c .cc .cpp .def .l .y .i .ac"   "fhook-cmode"
          add-file-hook ".h .hpp"                         "fhook-hmode"

sA
    In this case the lsdefine-macro-file(2)lmdefine-macro-filele has been used to inform MicroEmacs 2009
    of the location of the cDfhook-hmodecA macro thereby overriding the automatic
    load of a file called cDhkhmode.emfcA. The cDfhook-cmodecA macro requires no such
    definition as it is located in a hook file that matches the mode name,
    cGhkcmode.emfcA.


cEExtending a standard hook definition  cA


    The standard file hook files cDhkXXX.emfcA should not be modified. The
    standard file hooks may be extended with local definitions by defining a
    file cDmyXXX.emfcA, which is an extension to the hook file cDhkXXX.emfcA. This is
    automatically executed after cDhkXXX.emfcA. Refer to sections
    lsLanguage TemplateslmlanguageTemplates(2)le and lsfileHooks(2)lmFile Hooksle for details.


cEFile Extensions  cA


    The file extensions are specified as a space separated list of file name
    endings. Back-up file endings such as tilde (cG~cA) are not classed as correct
    file endings and are skipped by the file hook search, hence a file ending
    cGcG.c~cAcA invokes the same hook function as a cGcG.ccAcA file. It is therefore not
    necessary to add the backup and auto-save endings to the file hook
    definition.

    The extension separator, usually dot (cG.cA), is typically added to the
    cCextensionscA list, they may be omitted with effect where a file always ends
    in the same set of characters. A notable example is cGcGmakefilecAcA which
    includes no extension, as such, MicroEmacs 2009 applies the same hook
    function to a file called cGImakefilecA as the endings are the same.


cEBinary Files  cA


    It is sometimes useful to associate file types as binary files, so that
    they are immediately loaded in binary. In this case, both file extension
    and content recognition methods (i.e. of a magic string) are applicable.
    In both cases the file is bound to the well known hook cGfhook-binarycA which
    automatically loads the file in a binary mode.

    Note, that for the content recognition process for a binary hook, the load
    time is doubled as the file is initially loaded in the default text mode,
    the binary hook function forces a second load operation in binary.


cESUMMARY cA


    cDadd-file-hookcA is summarized as follows:-

    - Binds one or more extensions to a macro called fhook-cCxxxxcA.
    - Extensions are typically specified with the dot (cG.cA) separator.
    - Multiple extensions are specified as a space separated list.
    - Binds a regular expression search string to a macro called
          fhook-xxxx.
    - The absolute value of the numerical argument determines the number
          of lines in the file over which the regular expression search is
          made.
    - The sign of the numerical argument determines if the regular
          expression search is case (in)sensitive.
    - When one of the files with a known file extension, or recognized
          content, is loaded macro fhook-xxxx is executed.
    - cDfhook-xxxxcA, if undefined, is automatically searched for in file
          hkxxxx.emf.
    - When the buffer containing the known file is entered (i.e. gains
          focus), then entry macro bhook-xxxx is executed.
    - When the buffer containing the known file is exited (i.e. looses
          focus), then the exit macro ehook-xxxx is executed.

cEResolving Loading Order Problems  cA


    There is a potential loading order problem involving auto-loading of file
    libraries and the setting up of cDbhookcA and cDehookcA. E.g. if the main fhook
    function has been defined as a lsdefine-macro-file(2)lmdefine-macro-file(2)le, but the bhook or
    ehooks have not the when a buffer is created as only the fhook is define,
    only the fhook is set, the rest remain disabled even though the execution
    of the macro file will define these extra hooks.

    To solve this problem simply define the bhook/ehooks as well. Note that
    automatically loaded hooks do not suffer from this problem as the macro
    file is executed before the hooks are assigned, thereby ensuring the all
    the hooks are defined.

    cDosd-unbind-keycA cCncA "cCkeycA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDosd-bind-keycA creates a local key binding for a given lsosd(2)lmosd dialogle, binding
    the command cCcommandcA to the keyboard input cCkeycA. Only the current root
    dialog's local bindings are used, local bindings of included dialogs or
    other root dialogs currently displayed are ignored.

    Osd local bindings take priority over default osd bindings, local bindings
    created using lsml-bind-key(2)lmml-bind-key(2)le are also used, but any current buffer local
    bindings created using lsbuffer-bind-key(2)lmbuffer-bind-key(2)le are ignored.


cENOTES cA


    The prefix commands cannot be rebound with this command.

    Key response time linearly increases with each osd binding added.

    As only the root dialog's bindings are used, creating note-book page
    specific bindings can be awkward. Typically all required keys are bound to
    the same command which, depending on the page that is currently being
    displayed, checks if the key pressed is bound on the current page and if
    so calls the required command. See lsorganizer(3)lmorganizer(3)le, defined in cGorganize.emfcA
    for an example of this operation.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDglobal-modecA changes the state of one of the hereditary global modes. A
    buffer's modes are initialized to the global modes when first created.
    This command is very useful in changing some of the default behavior such
    as case sensitive searching (see the example below). See lsOperating ModeslmOperating Modesle
    for a full list and description of modes. Also see lsbuffer-mode(2)lmbuffer-mode(2)le for a
    full description of the use of the argument cCncA.

    The lsabout(2)lmabout(2)le command gives a list of the current global and buffer modes.

    cDadd-global-modecA and cDdelete-global-modecA are macros defined in meme3_8.emf
    which use global-mode to add or remove a global mode. They are defined for
    backward compatibility with MicroEMACS v3.8 and for ease of use; they are
    simple macros, add-global-mode is defined as follows:

sB
          define-macro add-global-mode
              ; Has the require mode been given as an argument, if so add it
              !force 1 global-mode @1
              !if &not $status
                  ; No - use 1 global-mode to add a mode

cEcENAME cEcA


    add-next-line - Define the searching behavior of command output
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDadd-next-linecA "cCbuffer-namecA" [ "cCstringcA" ]


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDadd-next-linecA is used to set up the cCnext-linecA functionality which is used
    by the lsget-next-line(2)lmget-next-line(2)le command. The cCnext-linecA feature is aimed at giving
    the user easy access to file locations which are stored in another buffer.
    This buffer may typically be the output from the cDgrep(1)cA command or a
    compiler (e.g. cDcc(1)cA) and needs to contain the file name and line number
    of the required location.

    As long as the format of the buffer is consistent and there is a maximum
    of one location per line, the cCnext-linecA feature can be successfully
    configured.

    The first argument, "cCbuffer-namecA", gives the name the aforementioned
    buffer, this is "cD*grep*cA" for the lsgrep(3)lmgrep(3)le command etc. There is no limit on
    the number of next-line formats, nor on the number of cDadd-next-linecA
    strings which are given. While there is no real need to initialize each
    new type, it is advised that the first cDadd-next-linecA is called with a
    numerical argument of zero, e.g.:

sB
          0 add-next-line "*grep*"
          add-next-line "*grep*" "....."

sA    
    This tells MicroEmacs to reinitialize the type by freeing off any strings
    currently stored, note that the "cCstringcA" argument is not used in this
    case. Resetting the next-line type safe guards against duplicate strings
    being added to it, a common problem if MicroEmacs is reinitialized.

    Following is a typical output from grep:

         foo.c: 45:      printf("hello world\n") ;
         foo.c: 46:      printf("hello again\n") ;


    If we replace the file name with cGcG%fcAcA and the line number with cGcG%lcAcA, this
    becomes:

         %f: %l:      printf("hello world\n") ;


    lsget-next-line(2)lmget-next-linele works on a left to right basis, as soon as it has enough
    information from the line it does not need to continue. Therefore the
    previous example can be reduced to just cG`%f: %l:`cA. This is the string
    argument that should be given for the above example, i.e.:

sB
          add-next-line "*grep*" "%f: %l:"

sA
    lsget-next-line(2)lmget-next-linele takes the given string and replaces the "%f" with
    ls$file-template(5)lm$file-template(5)le and the "%l" with the ls$line-template(5)lm$line-template(5)le and then uses
    the resultant string as a regular expression search string to find the
    next location. Crudely these could be set to cGcGfoo.ccAcA and cGcG45cAcA respectively
    to find the first example, but this would fail to find any other. As a
    result the templates are usually magic search strings which will match any
    file and line number.

    Similarly, following is an example output of the cDgcc(1)cA compiler:

         basic.c:522: warning: `jj' might be used uninitialized in this command
         display.c:833: warning: implicit declaration of function `ScreenPutChar'


    In this case the cDadd-next-linecA given needs to be:

sB
          add-next-line "*compile*" "%f:%l:"

sA
    If a negative numerical argument is given to cDadd-next-linecA the given
    'next-line' is ignored, this can be useful when some warnings are to be
    ignored. For example a common warning from gcc is given when a variable
    might be used uninitialized, given as follows:

         bind.c:578: warning: `ssc' might be used uninitialized in this function


    These warnings can be ignored using the following:

sB
          -1 add-next-line "*compile*" ...
              ... "%f:%l: warning: `.*' might be used uninitialized in this function"

sA
    Some versions of cDgrep(1)cA give the file name first and then the lines on
    the following lines. This is not a major problem as cDget-next-linecA
    remembers the last file name. The only problem occurs when skipping some
    parts of the list at which point the last file name parsed may not be the
    current file. Following is an example output of such a cDgrepcA and the setup
    required:

         File foo.c:
         Line 45:      printf("hello world\n") ;
         Line 46:      printf("hello again\n") ;


    The configuration to locate the lines is defined as:

sB
          0 add-next-line "*grep*"
          add-next-line "*grep*" "File %f:"
          add-next-line "*grep*" "Line %l:"

sA
cENOTES cA


    The reinitialize command format of this command changed in January 2001,
    the format changed from:

sB
          add-next-line "*grep*" ""

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    A keyboard macro is a short hand way to repeat a series of characters. In
    effect, a cCrecordingcA is made of the sequence of keys that you hit while
    defining a keyboard macro. The recording is started with cDstart-kbd-macrocA
    and ended with cDend-kbd-macrocA. The recording is then repeated whenever you
    execute the keyboard macro using lsexecute-kbd-macro(2)lmexecute-kbd-macro(2)le.

    Since it is key-strokes that are being saved, you can freely intermix
    commands and text to be inserted into the buffer.

    You can save a keyboard macro for later using the lsname-kbd-macro(2)lmname-kbd-macro(2)le
    command, which saves the keyboard macro as a named macro. Otherwise if you
    start another keyboard macro recording session, the previously defined
    macro is lost. So make sure that you are done with the current keyboard
    macro before defining another one. If you have a series of commands that
    you would like to cCrecordcA for later use, lsinsert-macro(2)lminsert-macro(2)le can be used to
    insert the macro into a text file and can be reloaded using the
    lsexecute-file(2)lmexecute-file(2)le or lsexecute-buffer(2)lmexecute-buffer(2)le commands.
    Using the command lssave-kbd-macro(3)lmsave-kbd-macro(3)le the named recorded macro can
    saved to the users emf file.
    
    Recording commences with cDstart-kbd-macrocA (cGC-x (cA) and terminates when an
    cDend-kbd-macrocA (`C-x )` is encountered.


cENOTES cA


    Once cDstart-kbd-macrocA has been executed, the mouse is disabled until
    cDend-kbd-macrocA is executed. This is because the mouse events cannot be
    successfully recorded in macros. The main menu can still be used, but only
    via the keyboard bindings and hot-keys (note that the layout of the menu
    may change).

    cCncA cDglobal-unbind-keycA "cCkeycA" (cDesc C-kcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDglobal-bind-keycA takes one of the named commands and binds it to a key.
    Thereafter, whenever that key is struck, the bound command is executed. If
    an argument cCncA is given then the bound command is executed cCncA times when the
    key is struck. (i.e. the command is passed the numeric argument 'cCncA').

    cDglobal-unbind-keycA unbinds (detaches) a user entered cCkeycA sequence (i.e. C-x
    C-f) from any command to which it may be bound. This does not work with
    lsbuffer-bind-key(2)lmbufferle or lsml-bind-key(2)lmmessage linele key bindings, see lsbuffer-unbind-key(2)lmbuffer-unbind-key(2)le and
    lsml-unbind-key(2)lmml-unbind-key(2)le. If an argument of 0 is given to global-unbind-key, only
    a single key is obtained for the user, if the character is currently bound
    to the lsprefix(2)lmprefixle command, the prefix binding and any sub-bindings are
    removed. cDglobal-bind-keycA calls cDglobal-unbind-keycA first if the key to be
    bound is already bound to something else.

    If a negative argument is given to cDglobal-unbind-keycA then all bindings are
    removed, cDcautioncA - removing all bindings interactively will render the
    current MicroEmacs session unusable. This can only be used within macro
    development where new bindings are created immediately afterwards.

    The cDglobal-bind-keycA command, currently bound to `esc k`, prompts the user
    for the named command and the key to which it is to be bound. This help
    file gives a complete list of all built in commands, and some useful
    macros, a complete list of all commands and macros can be obtained by
    using the command completion (type cGesc xcA cGtabcA cGtabcA, see lsml-bind-key(2)lmml-bind-key(2)le) or
    using the command lsdescribe-bindings(2)lmdescribe-bindings(2)le.

    The mouse buttons are considered to be cCkeyscA, there is a cCkeycA for each
    button press and release event, use lsdescribe-key(2)lmdescribe-key(2)le to get the binding key
    string.

    The non-ASCII standard keys such as the cursor keys have 'standard' key
    names to make cross platform binding support easy. Some systems such as
    cCtermcapcA do not have fixed key-bindings, for these key the users must use
    the command lstranslate-key(2)lmtranslate-key(2)le to convert the system key binding to the
    standard key binding.

    Permanent changes are done indirectly through the cGme.emfcA file. This is a
    file that MicroEmacs 2009 reads and executes (see lsexecute-file(2)lmexecute-file(2)le) during
    startup and hence results in the appearance of a permanent change in the
    key bindings. The syntax of commands in the cGme.emfcA file is described under
    the lsexecute-file(2)lmexecute-filele command. Of principal concern here are the two commands
    cDglobal-bind-keycA and cDglobal-unbind-keycA. The primary difference between the
    way parameters are passed to these commands in the cGme.emfcA file is that the
    keys are not typed in directly (as in the cCcontrol-IcA key when you want cGC-icA)
    but by symbolic names. Every key has a unique name which can be easily
    obtained with the current binding by using the command lsdescribe-key(2)lmdescribe-key(2)le.

    See help on lskeyNames(2)lmKey Namesle for a description of the symbolic naming system and
    a complete list of valid key names. Also see lsBindings(2)lmBindingsle for a complete list
    of default key bindings.

cENOTES cA


    Some ASCII keys, such as cG<CR>cA (C-m), cG<tab>cA (C-i), cG<BACKSPACE>cA (C-h) have
    non-ASCII key bindings, namely "cDreturncA", "cDtabcA", "cDbackspacecA" etc. this is
    to allow separate key-bindings for the real "cDC-mcA" etc.

    Be very careful in binding and unbinding keys since you could get into

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDchange-frame-depthcA changes the depth of the current frame, if the numeric
    argument cCncA is given then the frame depth is changed by cCncA lines. If cCncA is
    not specified the user is prompted for the new cCdepthcA and the frame depth
    will be changed to this value. It is assumed that the screen can draw the
    requested cCncA lines and MicroEmacs draws the lines at the users peril.

    A change in depth causes all of the internal windows currently displayed
    in the frame to be re-sized, the vertical position of the windows are
    modified to match the new screen dimension, the horizontal position of the
    windows remains unaltered. If the window is down-sized and the currently
    displayed windows are not able to fit into the new screen space then all
    windows are deleted with the exception of the current window.

    cDchange-frame-widthcA changes the width of the current frame, if the numeric
    argument cCncA is given then the frame width is changed by cCncA characters. If cCncA
    is not specified the user is prompted for the new cCwidthcA and the frame
    width will be changed to this value. It is assumed that the screen can
    draw the requested cCncA columns and MicroEmacs draws them at the users peril.
    The windows are reorganized as cDchange-frame-depthcA working horizontally
    rather than vertically.


cENOTES cA


    Within windowing environments such as cDX-WindowscA and cDMicrosoft WindowscA
    these commands cause the canvas window to be re-sized to accommodate the
    change in screen size.

    In MS-DOS and UNIX Termcap environments the physical size of the screen is
    determined by the characteristics of the display adapter.
    cDchange-frame-depthcA may be used to correct anomalies (usually on portables)
    in the displayable screen area and the graphics mode. e.g. In DOS the
    graphics mode utilizes 50 lines, and only 47 lines are viewable. In this
    case change the screen depth to 47 and MicroEmacs will not utilize the
    remaining lines which are not viewable.

! 2 search-buffer
cEcENAME cEcA


    search-buffer - Search the current buffer for a string
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDsearch-buffercA "cCflagscA" "cCstringcA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDsearch-buffercA searches for a cCstringcA from the current cursor position, in a
    forwards or backwards direction, to the end or start of the buffer,
    respectively. The search direction and mode is specified by the by cCflagscA
    argument.

    The cDsearch-buffercA command is designed to be used from the macro language
    rather than the command line as the search may be defined independently of
    the buffer setting of lsmagic(2m)lmmagic(2m)le mode, which allows regular expression
    pattern matching, or lsexact(2m)lmexact(2m)le mode, which makes the search case
    sensitive. The cCflagscA argument is used to explicitly set the lsmagic(2m)lmmagic(2m)le and
    lsexact(2m)lmexact(2m)le search modes.

    The cCflagscA argument is defined as a character string which defines the
    search behavior:

    cGbcA - backward search
    
     > Specifies the direction of the search as backwards, when omitted then
       a forward search is performed.

    cGecA - enable exact search
    
       A lsexact(2m)lmexact(2m)le mode search is performed, the characters are matched case
       sensitively.

    cGEcA - disable exact search

     > A lsexact(2m)lmexact(2m)le mode search is not performed, the characters are matched
       case insensitively.

    cGmcA - enable magic
 
       A lsmagic(2m)lmmagic(2m)le mode search is performed, the search cCstringcA is interpreted
       as a regular expression.

    cGMcA - disable magic

       A lsmagic(2m)lmmagic(2m)le mode search is not performed, the search string is
       searched for literally.

    When the cCflagscA are not specified then the default behavior is to search in
    a forwards direction inheriting the lsexact(2m)lmexact(2m)le and lsmagic(2m)lmmagic(2m)le modes of the
    buffer. Within macros it is suggested that the search modes are explicitly
    specified unless the buffer modes are to be inherited.

    The numeric argument cCncA is interpreted in the same way as a
    lssearch-forward(2)lmsearch-forward(2)le command:-

    cDn > 0cA
    
       The cCncAth occurrence of the cCstringcA is located.

    cDn < 0cA
    
       The first occurrence of the cCstringcA is located in the next cCncA lines.


cEDIAGNOSTICS cA


    The command returns a status of cGFALSEcA if the cCstringcA could not be located
    (or cCncAth cCstringcA where cCncA occurrences are requested). If the cCstringcA is found
    within the given search criteria the return status is cGTRUEcA.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following examples show the use of the cDsearch-buffercA command. The
    cDsearch-buffercA is usually used with the ls!force(4)lm!force(4)le directive which traps any
    cGFALSEcA return status and may be subsequently tested using the ls!if(4)lm!if(4)le
    directive on the status ls$status(5)lm$status(5)le variable. If the cD!forcecA directive is
    omitted then the macro will abort with a failure status if the search
    fails (sometimes this behavior may be required).

    Case sensitive search forward for the word cGcGfoocAcA, this is not a magic
    regular expression.

sB
          !force search-buffer "eM" "foo"
          !if $status
              ; found string

sB
          search-buffer "m" "[<>]"

sA
    Regular expression search catching the regular expression. A[a-z]*. The
    macro variable cD@s1cA returns the regular expression string that has been
    found.

sB
          !force search-buffer "em" "\\(A[a-z]*\\)"
          !if $status
              ; found string
              1000 ml-write &spr "Found string '%s'" @s1

cENOTES cA


    cDSearch-buffercA was added in November 2004 to simplify macro writing and to
    speed up macro execution. It replaces the macro commands cDregex-forward(3)cA
    and cDregex-backward(3)cA. The command simplifies macro development by
    allowing the lsexact(2m)lmexact(2m)le and lsmagic(2m)lmmagic(2m)le modes to be specified on the command
    line, this ensures that the buffer mode does not need to be saved, set and
    then restored in order to modify the behaviour of a search operation.

cEcENAME cEcA


    set-scroll-with-mouse - Scroll the window with the mouse
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDset-scroll-with-mousecA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDset-scroll-with-mousecA command controls the scrolling of a window by
    the mouse. This is a two stage process, the first stage locks the cursor
    to the mouse, the second stage scrolls the screen.

    The first stage (locking) is performed when the mouse is located on the
    scroll-box (typically when the left button is depressed i.e.
    cDpick-mouse-1cA). cDset-scroll-with-mousecA is invoked with an argument cCncA, this
    causes the mouse position to be recorded ready for a scroll. Depending on
    the scroll method, the blank lines present at the end of the buffer are
    scrolled off the screen.

    Subsequent calls to the cDset-scroll-with-mousecA are made with no argument,
    the window is scrolled by the relative displacement of the mouse from it's
    locked position, motion is limited at the end of the scrolling region.
    Scrolling is proportional to the buffer length. The command is typically
    bound to cDmove-mouse-1cA which results in an update whenever the mouse is
    moved by the user.

    When the button is released cDdrop-mouse-1cA then the scrolling is stopped by
    unbinding cDmove-mouse-1cA, thereby breaking the binding between the mouse
    moving and the scroll command.

    The scrolling utilizes fractional mouse positional information (i.e. units
    smaller than a character cell), if available, resulting in a smoother
    scrolling motion.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example shows how the command is used.

sB
          0 define-macro mouse-scroll-pick
              1 set-scroll-with-mouse         ; Lock mouse position to scroller
              global-bind-key set-scroll-with-mouse "mouse-move-1"
          !emacro

          0 define-macro mouse-scroll-drop
              global-unbind-key "mouse-move-1"

          global-bind-key mouse-scroll-pick "mouse-pick-1"
          global-bind-key mouse-scroll-drop "mouse-drop-1"

sA
    When the left button is 'picked', cDmouse-scroll-pickcA lock the cursor to the
    mouse and binds mouse movement to cDset-scroll-with-mousecA so that whenever
    the mouse is moved the cursor will be repositioned appropriately. When the
    button is 'dropped', the mouse movement is unbound so that the cursor will
    no longer be locked to the mouse.

    copy-region - Copy a region of the buffer
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDcopy-regioncA (cDesc wcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDcopy-regioncA copies all the characters between the cursor and the mark set
    with the lsset-mark(2)lmset-mark(2)le command into the kill buffer (so they can later be
    lsyank(2)lmyankedle elsewhere).

    If the last command also entered text into the kill buffer (or the ls@cl(4)lm@cl(4)le
    variable is set to one of these commands) the cDcopy-regioncA text is appended
    to the last kill.

    The numeric argument cCncA determines how the copy operates when a narrow
    region, defined by lsnarrow-buffer(2)lmnarrow-buffer(2)le, is encountered. The default
    operation, when the number argument is cG1cA, is to copy all of the text
    contained within the narrowed region. When the numeric argument is cG0cA then
    narrowed region is NOT copied and the text is copied as it appears in the
    buffer.


cEUSAGE cA


    To copy text from one place to another, using the cDcopy-regioncA command, the
    following operations are performed:

    - Move to the beginning of the text you want to copy.
    - Set the mark there with the lsset-mark(2)lmset-markle (cDesc-spacecA) command.
    - Move the point (cursor) to the end of the text.
    - Use cDcopy-regioncA to copy the region you just defined. The text will
          be saved in the kill buffer. (If you accidentally delete the text
          use lsyank(2)lmyankle (C-y) immediately or lsundo(2)lmundole (C-x u) to restore the text).
    - Move the point to the place you want the text to appear.
    - Use the lsyank(2)lmyankle (cDC-ycA) command to copy the text from the kill buffer to
          the current point.

    Repeat the last two steps to insert further copies of the same text.


cENOTES cA


    Windowing systems such as X-Windows and Microsoft Windows utilize a global
    windowing kill buffer allowing data to be moved between windowing
    applications (cCcut buffercA and cCclipboardcA, respectively). Within these
    environments MicroEmacs 2009 automatically interacts with the windowing
    systems kill buffer, the last MicroEmacs 2009 cDcopy-regioncA entry is

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDcreate-callbackcA "cCcommandcA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDcreate-callbackcA creates a timer based callback command. The given cCcommandcA
    is called back in cCncA milliseconds time. This can be used by the user to
    monitor system events (such as incoming mail). The command is called only
    once, but if the command creates a callback of itself a loop is created.

    If a negative argument cCncA is given any pending callback for cCcommandcA is
    cancelled.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example creates a callback that is invoked every 10 minutes.
sB
          define-macro Example-callback
              ml-write "It was 10 minutes since you last saw me!"

          !emacro
          Example-callback

sA
cENOTES cA


    A call-back cannot interrupt while MicroEmacs is active, instead the
    call-back is delayed until MicroEmacs becomes inactive. MicroEmacs is
    considered to be inactive when it is waiting for user input, this could be
    during the execution of another macro. If a command or macro requires no
    user input then once execution has started, it cannot be interrupted by a
    call-back macro.

    The resolution of the clock is platform dependent, some platforms limit
    the minimum timer period to 10 milliseconds.

    MicroEmacs does not guarantee to service the callbacks within any set time
    constraints, the resultant callback intervals may be of a slightly
    different duration than requested.

    When a callback macro is executed, the key given by ls@cck(4)lm@cck(4)le is cGcGcallbackcAcA.
    If the current buffer has a ls$buffer-input(5)lm$buffer-input(5)le command set, this command
    will be called instead of the callback command with cD@cccA and cD@cckcA set
    appropriately. It is the responsibility of the input macro to deal with
    the callback.

    The registry listing is generated in the buffer cGcG*registry*cAcA by default,
    the buffer may be modified with the cCbuffercA argument.

    The numerical argument cCncA is interpreted as a bit-mask as follows:-

    cC1cA
    
       If bit cG0x1cA is clear then the listing buffer is specified by the
       argument cCbuffercA. The default (when set) used buffer cG*registry*cA.

    cC2cA
    
       If bit cG0x2cA is set the path of the root of the registry is defined by
       argument cCpathcA. The default when clear is to list the whole registry.

    The visibility of the node is controlled by the attributes assigned by
    lsmark-registry(2)lmmark-registry(2)le. The node value may be hidden (modes !, i and h) and are
    not displayed in the resultant listing.


cEHISTORY cA


    The numeric argument to cDlist-registrycA with associated parameters and
    extended hidden modes were added in January 2005.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDchange-fontcA is a platform specific command which allows the displayable
    font to be modified. The selection of font is determined by the monitor
    resolution and the capabilities of the graphics adapter.

    This command is available on all systems except termcap. While MS-DOS does
    not support the concept of different fonts, it does (or at least the
    graphics card does) support the concept of changing screen resolution,
    which has the effect of changing the font. Each platform takes different
    arguments and are considered independently, as follows:


cEX-Windows  cA


    The X-Windows UNIX environments accept a single argument which is a fully
    qualified font name. Simply give the font X name and the font will change
    if it is available. The window size changes to attempt to retain the same
    number of rows and columns so ensure that when changing to a larger font
    then there is enough room (or a way) to resize a window which is larger
    than the actual screen.

    The X font string describes the attributes of the font in terms of it's
    size name etc. as follows:-

      cCfoundrycA-cCfamilycA-cCweightcA-cCslantcA-cCwidthcA--cCpixelscA-cCpointcA-cChrescA-cCvrescA-cCspacecA-cCavcA-cCsetcA

    Where

    cCfoundrycA
 
       The type of foundry that digitized and supplied the font.

    cCfamilycA
    
       Font Family.

    cCweightcA
    
       Modifies the appearance of the font, the cCweightcA is usually cDmediumcA or
       cDboldcA.

    cCslantcA
 
       Determines the orientation of the font. cCslantcA is usually cDrcAoman
       (upright), cDicAtalic or cDocAblique.

    cCwidthcA
 
       Describes the proportionate width of the font. Typical widths include
       cDnormalcA, cDcondensedcA, cDnarrowcA, cDdoublecA.

    cCpixelscA
 
       Pixel size of the font

    cCpointcA
    
       The resolution of the font in tenths of a cDdpicA (i.e. dpi*10)

    cChrescA
    
       Horizontal resolution of the font in dpi.

    cCvrescA
    
       Vertical resolution of the font in dpi.

    cCspacecA
    
       The spacing of the font. Typical spacing values include cDmcAonospaced
       (i.e. fixed width), cDpcAroportional and cDccAharacter cell.

    cCavcA

       Mean width of all font characters, measured in tenths of a pixel.

    cCsetcA
 
       Character set - character set standards e.g. cDiso8859-1cA.

    The default font used by MicroEmacs 2009 is

        -*-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-*-*-*-c-90-iso8859-1


    A good font to try is:

sB
       change-font "-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-*-*-*-c-80-iso8859-1"

sA
    The font may also be changed in your cD.XdefaultscA file by inserting the
    line:-

        MicroEmacs.font "-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-*-*-*-c-80-iso8859-1"


cEIBM-PC / MS-DOS  cA


    MS-DOS may only change the screen resolution, the standard screen
    resolution is either 80 columns by 25 rows or 80 by 50. A more advanced
    graphics card can typically support up to 132 by 60, MicroEmacs in theory
    has no limit but it has only been tested up to this size.

    The main problem with MS-DOS machines is that there is no standard and
    this is no exception. The graphics mode needed to get a 132 by 60 screen
    (if available) varies from one card to the next so MicroEmacs 2009 needs
    to know the graphic mode number your card uses to get your required screen
    resolution.

    MicroEmacs 2009 can also attempt a little bit of magic to double the
    number of rows on the screen for a given screen resolution. This is how 50
    lines are obtained from the standard 25 line mode 3. If the value of
    "cCspeccA" is non-zero then this is attempted, to the authors knowledge this
    will either work or not depending on the direction of the wind and no harm
    will befall the users equipment. However the author also quickly disclaims
    anything and everything, the user uses this at their own peril, like
    everything else.

    MicroEmacs 2009 attempts to determine the new screen width and depth
    itself, in case this fails the commands lschange-frame-width(2)lmchange-frame-width(2)le and
    lschange-frame-depth(2)lmchange-frame-depth(2)le may be used to correct the problem.

    Following are the standard MS-DOS text modes:

sB
          change-font "2" "0"       ; Simple monochrome or EGA monitor, 80 by 25.
          change-font "3" "0"       ; Simple EGA/VGA monitor, again 80 by 25.
          change-font "3" "1"       ; Simple EGA/VGA monitor using spec, 80 by 50.

sA
    Most Trident cards support the following text mode:

sB
          change-font "86" "0"      ; Sweet 132 by 60

sA
    A Diamond Stealth supports the following mode:

sB
          change-font "85" "1"      ; Nice 132 by 50

sA
    Cirrus video cards (1MB) seem to support:

sB
          change-font "84" "1"      ; PT-526 (132x50)

sA
    Time to start digging out your graphics card manual!


cEMicrosoft Windows  cA


    The Microsoft Windows environments utilize font files to drive the
    display. When cDchange-fontcA is invoked with no arguments, or a negative
    argument then a font dialog is presented to the user to allow the font to
    be selected. The current font is not changed if a negative argument is
    given, in both cases the variable ls$result(5)lm$result(5)le is set the the user selected
    font. The format of the returned string is cGcGOWwwwwhhhhhFontNamecAcA, where:-

    cDOcA

       The type of character set (0 for OEM and 1 for ANSI).

    cDWcA
 
       The font weight (0 - 9).

    cDwwwwcA

       The font width.

    cDhhhhcA
      
       The font height.

    cDFontNamecA
 
       The font name.

    If a positive argument is specified with cDchange-fontcA then the arguments
    are explicitly entered, arguments are defined as follows:-

    cCfontcA
    
       The name of the font - maximum of 32 characters. Select Fixed mono
       fonts only. Proportional fonts may be specified but the cursor will
       not align with the characters on the screen.

       An empty name ("") may be specified resulting in the selection of the
       default system OEM font. No other arguments are required when
       specified.

       Note that cDCourier NewcA is not actually a fixed mono font as might be
       expected.

    cCcharSetcA
    
       The type of character set required, this is an integer value of:-

                0 - ANSI or Western (True Type etc)
              161 - Greek
              162 - Turkish
              204 - Russian
              255 - OEM (or bitmapped)

    cCweightcA
    
       The weight of the font. The values are defined as:-

              0 - Don't care (Automatically selected).
              1 - Thin
              2 - Extra Light
              3 - Light
              4 - Normal
              5 - Medium
              6 - Semi-Bold
              7 - Bold
              8 - Extra-Bold
              9 - Heavy

    Note that you may request a weight and it is not honored. Typically 4
    and 7 are honored by most font definitions. 4 is typically used.

    cCwidthcA

       The width of the font. Specifies the average width, in logical units,
       of characters in the requested font. If this value is zero, the font
       mapper chooses a "closest match" value. The "closest match" value is
       determined by comparing the absolute values of the difference between
       the current device's aspect ratio and the digitized aspect ratio of
       available fonts.

       Note that if the width is specified as zero then the height should be
       specified and the width will be automatically selected.

    cCheightcA

       The height of the font. Specifies the desired height, in logical
       units, of the requested font's character cell or character. (The
       character height value is the character cell height value minus the
       internal-leading value.) If this value is greater than zero, the font
       mapper matches it against available character cell height values; if
       this value is zero, the font mapper uses a default height value when
       it searches for a match; if this value is less than zero, the font
       mapper matches it against available character height values.

       Note: as with the weight the width and height may not be honored if
       the font cannot support the specified width/height in which case the
       closest matching height is automatically selected


cENotes on the Standard Windows Configuration  cA


    For releases prior to '99, the cDTerminalcA font is the standard MS-DOS font
    used for the MS-DOS window. This is an OEM fixed width character set which
    contains all of the conventional symbols found in the DOS shell.

    Releases of MicroEmacs post '99 may utilise any of the windows fonts,
    typically cGCourier NewcA or cGLucida ConsolecA are used, these provide the best
    screen rendering of characters. cGLucida ConsolecA is slightly better with a
    smaller font size as this allows a cCcG1cAcA (one) and cCcGlcAcA (lower case L) to be
    distinguished.

    The cDTerminalcA fonts are the same as shown in the DOS window the last 2
    arguments are the width x height, the terminal equivalents (Bit Mapped)
    are commented here.

    cD7x12cA
    
       Regular weight seems to offer the best resolution for 14/15" monitors.

    cD6x8cA
 
       Regular weight is more suitable for 17-21" monitors which offer better
       resolutions.

    The best options for the fonts are defined as follows:-

sB
          ;Standard Terminal Fonts - standard weight
          ;change-font "Terminal" 0 4  4  6
          change-font "Terminal" 0 4  6  8

          ;change-font "Terminal" 0 4  8 12
          ;change-font "Terminal" 0 4 12 16
          ;change-font "Terminal" 0 4 10 18

          ;Standard Terminal Fonts - heavy weight

    cDchange-font-boldcA     is a command  which  toggles fonts between bold and
                         medium weighted fonts.

    cDchange-font-couriercA  sets the  default  font for  resizing  to Adobe
                         courier.

    cDchange-font-lucidacA   sets the  default  font for  resizing  to lucidatypewriter
      
    cDchange-font-typecA     allows an easier  switching  of font just giving
                         the main font and an optional font-size or using an 
                         interactive menu if no arguments are given

    cDchange-font-xfontselcA  allow to chose the font if the X11 tool  xfontself
                          is installed
      
    The font-size is increased in case of C-+ and decreased in case of the C--
    minus    key     bindings.     For    Unix    systems    the     variables
    ls.change-font.sz-font(5)lm.change-font.sz-font(5)le and ls.change-font.sz-size(5)lm.change-font.sz-size(5)le  are  used to cycle
    through two standard fonts, Adobe courier and  lucidatypewriter.  The user
    can define  their own short fonts using just the family and the weight and
    give the their list of available sizes through which they like to cycle through.

      prefix 4 (C-c)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    prefix sets up to 8 prefix key sequences, allowing two stroke key
    bindings. The command does not do anything, it is used to create double
    barrel key bindings such as such as lsgoto-line(2)lmgoto-line(2)le (esc g). This binding may
    be redefined, redefining ALL meta bindings. If the meta bindings are not
    required the command should first be unbound using the
    lsglobal-unbind-key(2)lmglobal-unbind-key(2)le.

    The prefix key can only be defined using the lsglobal-bind-key(2)lmglobal-bind-key(2)le, passing
    the command the prefix number required, for example:

sB
          1 global-bind-key "prefix" "esc "
          2 global-bind-key "prefix" "C-x"

sA
    Binds the first prefix to the Escape key and the second prefix to
    Control-x.

    The first prefix key (cDprefix 1cA) differs from the other prefixes since it
    permits entry of the numeric argument at the message line, e.g. "esc 1 0  C-f"
    will move forward 10 characters.
    

cENOTES cA


    Invocating this command via lsexecute-named-command(2)lmexecute-named-command(2)le or by a macro has no
    effect. It can be bound to only one key sequence which must be a single
    key stroke such as cDC-xcA etc. Re-binding the command to another key will not
    only unbind the new key but also the current cDprefix ?cA key bindings.

    cDdefine-macrocA starts the definition of an macro named cCmacro-namecA, only used
    within macro files or buffers. After the above header line, the body of
    the macro is added, one command or expression on a line. The macro
    definition is completed by the ls!emacro(4)lm!emacrole directive.

    The numeric argument cCncA, specified as zero, defines the macro as private
    such that it does not appear on a command completion list. A zero argument
    is generally used on helper macro's that form part of a larger macro. If
    the argument is omitted, or non-zero, then the macro appears in the
    command completion list.

    See lsexecute-file(2)lmexecute-file(2)le for a complete definition and examples of the
    MicroEmacs 2009 macro language.

    Once the macro has been defined, it becomes indistinguishable from a
    standard MicroEmacs 2009 command, i.e. lsexecute-named-command(2)lmexecute-named-command(2)le (cGesc xcA)
    can be used to execute the macro and lsglobal-bind-key(2)lmglobal-bind-key(2)le can be used to
    globally bind the command to a key combination.

    There are no restrictions on the number of macros that may be defined,
    provided that the name space is managed properly. Consideration must be
    given as to when any additional macros that are created are loaded into
    MicroEmacs 2009. We usually like start-up to be rapid and macros are
    loaded as and when requested by the user, or by the buffer hooks as new
    files are loaded (see lsadd-file-hook(2)lmadd-file-hook(2)le and lsdefine-macro-file(2)lmdefine-macro-file(2)le).

    User defined macros may be documented with on-line help by including a
    lsdefine-help(2)lmdefine-help(2)le construct within the macro file.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following are two standard macros provided with MicroEmacs 2009. The
    first is a macro called cDcleancA, this strips trailing white space from the
    ends of lines in a file and removes blank lines from the end of the file.

sB
          define-macro clean
              ;
              ; Prepare to clean up file.
              ; Remember line & magic mode
              set-variable #l0 $window-line
              set-variable #l1 &not &bmod magic
              !if #l1
                  1 buffer-mode "magic"
              !endif
              ;
              ; Get rid of trailing white space on EOL
              beginning-of-buffer
              replace-string "[\t ]+$" "\\0"
              beginning-of-buffer
              replace-string "[ ]+\t" "\t"
              ;
              ; Strip trailing blank lines.
              end-of-buffer
              backward-line
              !while &and &gre $window-line 1 &sequal @wc "\n"
                  kill-line
                  backward-line
              !done
              ;
              ; Clean up - restore buffer modes etc.
              ; Move back to starting line & restore original magic mode
              !force goto-line #l0
              !if #l1
                  -1 buffer-mode "magic"
              !endif
              screen-update
              ml-write "Cleaned up file."
          !emacro

sA
    The second example converts all of the cG<tab>cA characters in the file to
    their cG<SPACE>cA character equivalent.

sB
          ;
          ; tabs-to-spaces.
          ; Convert all of the tabs to spaces.
          define-macro tabs-to-spaces
              ; Remember line
              set-variable #l0 $window-line
              beginning-of-buffer
              !force search-forward "\t"
              !while $status
                  set-variable #l1 $window-acol
                  backward-delete-char
                  &sub #l1 $window-acol insert-space
                  !force search-forward "\t"
              !done
              goto-line #l0
              screen-update
              ml-write "[Converted tabs]"
          !emacro

sA
    Both of these commands are available from the command line, they are
    indistinguishable from the built in commands.

    Macros may also be nested, as shown in the next example, this macro
    contains a cDdefine-macrocA within itself, when executed the macro creates
    another macro dynamically - dynamic macros are generally given a prefix of
    cD%cA and are highlighted differently in lsdescribe-bindings(2)lmdescribe-bindings(2)le.

    The following example is taken from the lsalarm(3)lmalarm(3)le macro, executing cDalarmcA
    the user is prompted for a message, and the time interval before the alarm
    expires in hours and minutes. It then creates a new macro with a callback
    so that the new macro will be called at the correct time.

sB
          !if &seq %alarm-numb "ERROR"
              set-variable %alarm-numb 0
              set-variable %osd-alarm &pinc %osd 1
          !endif

          define-macro alarm
              set-variable %alarm-numb &add %alarm-numb 1
              set-variable #l0 &cat "%alarm-" %alarm-numb
              !force set-variable #l2 @3
              !if &not $status
                  set-variable &ind #l0 @ml "Message"
                  set-variable #l1 @ml "Hours"
                  set-variable #l2 @ml "Minutes"
              !else
                  set-variable &ind #l0 @1
                  set-variable #l1 @2
              !endif
              set-variable #l1 &mul 60000 &add &mul 60 #l1 #l2
              define-macro #l0
                  !bell
                  set-variable #l0 &add &len &ind @0 10
                  osd %osd-alarm 0 "bat" 9 3
                  osd %osd-alarm 1 ""

    delete-buffer - Delete a buffer
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDdelete-buffercA "cCbuffer-namecA" (cDC-x kcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDdelete-buffercA disposes of buffer cCbuffer-namecA in the editor and reclaim the
    memory. This does not delete the file that the buffer was read from.

    If the buffer has been edited and its name does not start with a 'cCcC*cAcA' then
    the user is prompted as to whether the changes should be discarded. Also
    if the buffer has an active process running in it then confirmation is
    sort from the user before the process is killed.

    The argument cCncA can be used to change the default behavior of delete-buffer
    described above, cCncA is a bit based flag where:-

    cD0x01cA
    
       Enables loss of work checks (default). These include a check that the
       buffer has not been modified, if so the user is prompted. Also if a
       process is running then user must confirm that the process can be
       killed. If this flag is not supplied then the buffer is killed without
       any user prompts (useful in macros).

cEcENAME cEcA


    directory-tree - Draw the file directory tree
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDdirectory-treecA ["cCdirectorycA"]


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDdirectory-treecA creates or manipulates a view of the file systems directory
    structure. The command is quite complex to use directly so is largely used
    but macros such as lsfile-browser(3)lmfile-browser(3)le.

    The argument cCncA is a bit based flag which is used to control the command,
    where the bits have the following meaning:-

    cD0x01cA
    
       If set, the focal directory of the command is set by the given
       "cCdirectorycA" argument. Otherwise the argument is not required and the
       command must be executed within the "cC*directory*cA" buffer; the current
       line sets the focal directory.

    cD0x02cA
    
       Specifies that the current line in resultant "cC*directory*cA" window
       should be set to the focal directory. If this bit is not set then the
       current line will be the last selected directory, or if none have been
       selected, the first line in the buffer.

    cD0x04cA

       Specifies that any evaluations required during the commands operation
       should be performed. Without this flag an open operation on a
       directory which has not previously been evaluated will not be perform
       an evaluation and the results will likely be incomplete.

    cD0x08cA

       Specifies that the current focal directory should be opened. This
       means that sub-directories within the current focal directory will
       also be drawn in the directory tree.

    cD0x10cA
    
       Specifies that the current focal directory should be closed. This
       means that sub-directories within the current focal directory will not
       be drawn in the directory tree.

    cD0x20cA

       Specifies that the current focal directory's open state should be
       toggled. This means that if the sub-directories are currently hidden
       they will now be drawn and vice-versa.

    cD0x40cA

        When specified any directory opened will be re-evaluated, ensuring the
       accuracy of the information.

    cD0x80cA
 
       Enables a recursive behavior, for example if this flag was specified
       with the open then not only will the focal directory be opened, but
       all of it's children, and their children etc. Note that if the
       Evaluation flag is not specified then only the already evaluated
       directories can be opened.

    directory-tree creates a new buffer "cC*directory*cA" and draws the known
    directory tree. Every drawn directory is preceded by a character flag
    giving the user an indication of the directory state, where:

    cD?cA
    
       Directory has not been evaluated.

    cD-cA
 
       Directory has been evaluated and is visible.

    cD+cA
    
       Directory has been evaluated but is currently hidden.

    Directories which have been evaluated and found to have no children use
    the '-' ls$box-chars(5)lm$box-chars(5)le instead of a '-' character.

    On UNIX platforms, if a directory is a symbolic link to another directory,
    the link name is given after the directory name.

    be found in hkdirlst.emf.

    cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" "cDxcA" | "cDwcA" "cCtokencA" "cCindentcA" "cCindent-schemecA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDindentcA  command creates and manages the  auto-indenting  methods, the
    process of creating a new  indentation  method is best described in 
    lslanguageTemplates(2)lmLanguage Templatesle  The command  takes various forms as defined
    by the arguments. Each of the argument configurations is defined as follows:-


cEIndentation Method Creation  cA


    cC0cA cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" "cCflagscA" "cClook-backcA" [ "cCindent-schemecA" ]

    With an argument of cG0cA, cDindentcA creates a new indentation method with the
    integer handle cCind-nocA. The indentation method is assigned to a buffer by
    setting ls$buffer-indent(5)lm$buffer-indent(5)le to cCind-nocA. cCind-nocA cannot be 0 as setting
    cD$buffer-indentcA to zero disables indentation. If the indentation method
    with the same cCind-nocA already exists, then the existing method is deleted
    and a new method may be created.

    cCflagscA Sets the indent bit flags where:-

    cG0x01cA
    
       Indent method is case insensitive. Note that cDindentcA tokens must be
       specified in lower case.

    cG0x02cA
    
       Defines a cDfast look-backcA indentation scheme to be used in conjunction
       with the current indentation scheme. The fast look-back scheme is used
       to identify a change in the current buffer's indent scheme, for
       example the starting of embedded script in html. The cCindent-schemecA
       argument is required when this flag bit is set and identifies the
       handle of the fast look-back indentation scheme to be used.

       This feature is only used when indent is required to support multiple
       complex indentation schemes within a single file, for example
       indentation of scripts within html, asp or php pages etc. When defined
       the given cCindent-schemecA must also be defined using cDindentcA, the
       scheme's cClook-backcA argument is typically set to look back a long way
       to ensure correctness, i.e. 500 lines, but it should therefore contain
       few tokens to maintain performance.

    cG0x04cA
    
       Defines C mode of indentation. C styling is built into the editor and
       is enabled through the cDindentcA command. The C form is discussed in more
       detail in the next section.

    cG0x08cA
    
       Ring the bell if lsgoto-matching-fence(2)lmgoto-matching-fence(2)le fails.

    cG0x10cA
    
       Comment continuation mode. This is only valid when C mode is defined
       and is defined further in the next section.

    cClook-backcA specifies the maximum number of lines, prior to the current
    line, considered when calculating the indentation of a line, i.e. if there
    are cClook-backcA number of lines between the line to be indented and the
    previous non-blank line then the current indentation is lost.

    If cClook-backcA is set to 0 then the indentation is effectively disabled as
    the current indentation can never be found. The maximum value has been
    increase as of January 2004 from 255 to an integer (large number), a value
    of 10 is typically sufficient for a normal indent scheme and 500 for a
    fast look-back scheme.

    cC0cA cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" "cCflagscA"  
    cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" cGscA "cCstatementcA"  
    cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" cGccA "cCcontinuecA"  
    cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" cGxcA "cCmaxcA"  
    cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" cGbcA "cCbracecA"  
    cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" cGecA "cCbraceStatementcA"  
    cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" cGwcA "cCswitchcA"

    cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" cGucA "cCcomcontcA"  

    C mode is built into the editor by default and is enabled by setting the
    indent intialization flag bit cG0x04cA. With this bit enabled then the
    indentation for 'C' mode is defined through the additional arguments.
    cCind-nocA and cCflagscA have the same meaning as defined in the previous section.
    C mode is typically initialized with the value 12. The remaining C
    arguments are defined as follows:

    cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" cGcGscAcA "cCstatementcA" (=t)
 
       The indent of the current line is derived from cCstatementcA value plus
       the indent of the last c token (cCifcA, cCelsecA, cCwhilecA etc.) or the last cCcG{cAcA
       (which ever was found first). i.e. if the last cCcG{cAcA was found at column
       16 then the current line will be indented to 20:-

                      {
                          xxxxxxxxxx
                          xxxxxxxxxx


       or

                      if(xxxxx)
                          xxxxxxxxxx


    C tokens are only used to indent the next line, whereas cCcG{cAcA are used
    in indenting every line to it's partnering cCcG}cAcA.

    cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" cGcGccAcA "cCcontinuecA" (=3/2t)
    
       cCcontinuecA sets the indent to be added to a split line, i.e. for an
       indent of 20, a continued statement would be indented to 30. A
       continued statement is a single c statement which is spread over 2 or
       more lines, the 2nd and any following lines would be indented to 30.
       For example

                      thisIsAVeryLongVariableWhichMeansAssignmentsAreSplit =
                                ThisIsTheFirstContinuedStatementLine +
                                ThisIsTheSecondContinuedStatementLine + etc ;


       The indent is changed if there is an open bracket, continued
       statements are indented to the depth of the open bracket plus one,
       e.g.

                      func(firstFuncArg,
                           secondFuncArg,
                           anotherBracketForFun(firstAnotherBracketForFunArg,
                                                secondAnotherBracketForFunArg),
                           thirdFuncArg) ;


    cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" cGcGxcAcA "cCmaxcA"

       cCmaxcA sets an upper limit of the indentation where an open bracket is
       encountered, in the case where the leading indent of the function name
       and open bracket exceeds cCmaxcA, then the continuation is reduced to the
       continuation indent.

       The effect of cCmaxcA is described as follows; if cCmaxcA is set to a large
       value then the default open brace offset appearence is:-

              longVariable = LongFunctionNameWhichMeans(isSoFar,
                                                        OverAndYouRunOutOfRoom) ;


       Setting cCmaxcA to 16 gives:

              longVariable = LongFunctionNameWhichMeans(isSoFar,
                              overAndYouRunOutOfRoom) ;


       Where by the second argument indent has been artificially reduced
       because of it's length.

    cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" cGcGbcAcA "cCbracecA" (=0)
    
       Sets the indent of a cCcG{cAcA and a cCcG}cAcA on a new line from the current
       statement indent. For example, a value of 0 results in the following

                              if(xxxxxx)
                              {
                                  xxxxxxxxxx
                                  xxxxxxxxxx
                              }


       With a setting of 2, this would become:-

                              if(xxxxxx)
                                {
                                  xxxxxxxxxx
                                  xxxxxxxxxx
                                }


       This works in conjunction with cCstatementcA and cCbraceStatementcA a change
       to cCstatementcA will change the position of cCcG{cAcAs. In summary:

              if (condition)      if (condition)     if (condition)
              {                       {                {
                  statement;          statement;         statement;
              }                       }                }

              brace = 0             brace = 4         brace = 2


    cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" cGcGecAcA "cCbraceStatementcA" (t)
    
       The cCbraceStatementcA defines the indentation following a curly brace cCcG{cAcA
       which follows a statement.

    cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" cGcGwcAcA "cCswitchcA" (=0)
    
       The additional indent to be applied after a cDswitchcA statement, the
       cCstatementcA indent is applied in addition to the cCswitchcA indent. See the
       cCcasecA argument.

    cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" cGcGacAcA "cCcasecA" (=-t)

       cCswitchcA value sets the offset of a cGcGcasecAcA entry statement from the
       opening brace left margin position. The default value is zero. e.g.

                              switch(xxxxxxxxx)
                              {
                              case 1:
                                  xxxxxxxxxx
                                  xxxxxxxxxx
                              case 2:
                                  xxxxxxxxxx
                              }


       Setting the value to 4, increases the leading space on the cGcGcasecAcA
       statement, e.g.

                              switch(xxxxxxxxx)
                              {
                                  case 1:
                                      xxxxxxxxxx
                                      xxxxxxxxxx
                                  case 2:
                                      xxxxxxxxxx
                              }


       cCcasecA sets the offset of the lines following a cGcGcasecAcA statement, from
       the current indent. For example, using the default settings, if the
       current indent was 20 then a line starting with a cGcGcasecAcA would be
       indented to 16, i.e.

                                  xxxxxxxxxx
                              case xxxxxxxxxx
                                  xxxxxxxxxx


       This is used inside cGcGswitchcAcA statements, the default setting give the
       following lay-out:-

                              switch(xxxxxxxxxx)
                              {
                              case 1:
                                  xxxxxxxxxx
                                  xxxxxxxxxx
                              case 2:


       This works in conjunction with the cCstatementcA variable, a change to
       cCstatementcA will change the position of cCcG{cAcAs.

       In summary:

              switch (variable)   switch (variable)
              {                   {
              case 1:                 case 1:
                  break;                  break;
              default:                default:
                  break;                  break;
              }                    }

                switch = 0           switch = t
                case = -t            case = -t


    cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" cGcGmcAcA "cCmargincA" (=-1)

       If inserting a comment at the end of a C line, it is tedious typing cCxcA
       number of spaces to the comment column (by default tab does not insert
       a tab when lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le is enabled, it reformats the indentation of the
       line regardless of the cursor position). This variable sets the indent
       column of these comments. So with the default settings and the
       following line,

                      xxxxxx ;/


       when a '*' is entered the line becomes

                      xxxxxx ;                /*


       The indenting of the cGcG/*cAcA occurs only if there is text on the line
       before it, and none after it. If the current column is already past
       cCmargincA then it is indented to the next tab stop.

       A value of -1 disables this feature.

       In summary:

                  statement;        /* Comment */      statement; /* Comment */

                  margin = 40                          margin = -1


    cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" cGcGucAcA "cCcomcontcA" (cG` * `cA)
    
       This argument is only specified if cCflagscA bit cG0x10cA is set. This defines
       the string which is inserted when a new line is started while in a
       comment. The string is only inserted if the cursor is at the end of
       the line when the lsnewline(2)lmnewline(2)le command is given. For example, for the
       default settings, if a cDnewlinecA was entered at the end of the first
       line, the second line would initialize to:-

                              /* xxxxxxxxxx
                                 @


       where cCcG@cAcA is the current cursor position. With a setting of cG` * `cA,
       then:-

                              /* xxxxxxxxxx
                               * @


       In summary:

              /*                  /*               /* Comment
               * Comment          ** Comment          Comment */
               * Comment          ** Comment
               */                 */
               comcont = " * "    comcont = "** "   comcont = "   "


    The standard indent rule for setting up C and Java is defined as:-

sB
              0 indent .hilight.c 12
              indent .hilight.c "s" t     ; Default may be omitted
              indent .hilight.c "e" t     ; Default may be omitted
              indent .hilight.c "c" 3/2t  ; Default may be omitted
              indent .hilight.c "x" 0     ; Default may be omitted
              indent .hilight.c "b" 0     ; Default may be omitted
              indent .hilight.c "w" 0     ; Default may be omitted
              indent .hilight.c "a" -t    ; Default may be omitted
              indent .hilight.c "m" -1    ; Default may be omitted
              indent .hilight.c "u" " * "

sA
    This is typically written with the defaults omitted.

sB
              0 indent .hilight.c 12
              indent .hilight.c "u" " * "

sA    If GNU Emacs indentation is required then the following definition may be
    used:-

sB
              0 indent .hilight.c 12            ; if (a == b)
              indent .hilight.c "e" t           ;   {
              indent .hilight.c "b" t           ;     c = d;
              indent .hilight.c "s" t           ;   }
              indent .hilight.c "u" " * "

sA
    The default configuration scheme is defined as:-

sB
              0 indent .hilight.c 12            ; if (a == b)
              indent .hilight.c "e" t           ; {
              indent .hilight.c "b" 0           ;   c = d;
              indent .hilight.c "s" t           ; }
              indent .hilight.c "u" " * "

sA
    Where comments are to be aligned at the end of a statement then the margin
    parameter may be defined in cG<user>.emfcA.

sB

sA
cEIndentation Rule Creation  cA


    cDindentcA "cCind-nocA" "cCtypecA" "cCtokencA" [ "cCclosecA" [ "cCignorecA" ]] [ "cCindentcA" ] [
    "cCindent2cA" ] [ "cCindent-schemecA" ]

    With the default argument of cG1cA, cDindentcA creates a new rule for the
    indentation method cCind-nocA which must have previously been defined and
    initialized.

    The indentation of a line in a buffer, which is using an indentation
    method, is affected by the token types matched on the line (cCtypecA cGfcA, cGocA, cGscA)
    and the current indentation (if line is not of type cGfcA).

    The current indentation is determined by searching the previous lines
    (look-back) for the indentation of the last indented line. This may not
    simply be the indentation of the last non-blank line, the exact
    indentation is determined by searching for tokens in the line and
    assessing their effect on the indentation of the current line.

    The format of the regex valid in the "cCtokencA" and "cCclosecA" arguments are the
    same as at used by hilight token creation, see lshilight(2)lmhilight(2)le for more
    information.

    The cCindentcA argument specifies the indent to apply in characters. The
    indent may be specified as a literal integer value, a positive value
    increases the indent a negative value reduces the indent. The cCindentcA may
    be specified in terms of buffer specific generic value
    ls$buffer-indent-width(5)lm$buffer-indent-width(5)le using the value t, indicating a tab width. The
    value of cDtcA may be prefixed with a signed integer or vulgar fraction which
    adjusts the size of the indentation width by the appropriate amount.
    Modifying the value of ls$indent-width(5)lm$buffer-indent-widthle modifies the indent width that
    is applied allowing the indentation method to be specified independently
    of the indentation width.

    The indent tokens may be assigned one of the following types, using the
    cCtypecA argument. If the type is specified in upper case then the token must
    be surrounded by non-alpha-numeric characters:

    cDFixedcA (cCtypecA = cCcGfcAcA or cCcGFcAcA)

       A line containing a fixed indent token will be indented to the given
       cCindentcA column from the left-hand edge. cCindentcA is the only argument
       specified. e.g. MicroEmacs macro cG!gotocA labels:-

sB
              indent .hilight.emf f "*" 0

sA    
       producing

                  .....
              *label
                  .....


        The fixed token must be the first non-white character on the line, the
       rest of the line is ignored. The indentation of the previous line has
       no effect.

    cDIndent-from-next-line-onwardcA (cCtypecA = cCcGncAcA or cCcGNcAcA)

       The indentation changes by cCindentcA from the next line onwards from the
       current line. cCindentcA is the only argument specified. e.g. MicroEmacs
       macro cG!ifcA:-

sB
              indent .hilight.emf n "!if" t

sA
       Keeps the indentation of the cG!ifcA line the same as the previous
       indentation, change the indentation on the following lines by an extra
       ls$indent-width(5)lm$buffer-indent-widthle characters, to produce:

              ....
              !if
                  ....


    cDIndent-from-current-line-onwardcA (cCtypecA = cCcGocAcA or cCcGOcAcA)

       Increment the current and following lines indentation by cCindentcA.
       cCindentcA is the only argument specified. e.g. MicroEmacs macro cG!endifcA

sB
              indent .hilight.emf o "!endif" -t

sA
       decrement the indent of the cG!endifcA line and following lines by
       ls$indent-width(5)lm$buffer-indent-widthle spaces producing:

                  ....
              !endif
              ....


    cDUniversal-indentcA (cCtypecA = cCcGucAcA or cCcGUcAcA)

       Independent control of the current line and next line indent.
       Increment the current line indentation by cCindentcA and the following
       line indentation by cCindent2cA. Where cCindentcA represents indent with the cGocA
       option and cCindent2cA represents indent with the cGncA option. This command
       is useful where the indentation of both the current and next line need
       to be controlled independently given a single token.

sB
              indent .hilight.emf u "<cfelse" -t 3/2t

sA
       This has been used in the cCColdFusioncA indentation to control the
       cG<cfelse>cA condition which requires control of both the current line and
       next line with different values from the same token. Note that a
       cDIndent-singlecA could be implemented with this command using an argument
       of `-t t`.

    cDIndent-singlecA (cCtypecA = cCcGscAcA or cCcGScAcA)

       Changes the indentation of the current line ONLY by cCindentcA. cCindentcA is
       the only argument specified. e.g. MicroEmacs macro cG!elifcA:-

sB
              indent .hilight.emf o "!elif" -t

sA
       decrements the indentation of the cG!elifcA line by ls$indent-width(5)lm$buffer-indent-widthle
       characters, but restores the previous indentation after the current
       line, producing:

                  ....
              !elif
                  ....


    cDBracketcA (cCtypecA = cCcGbcAcA or cCcGBcAcA)

       A bracket should be used when a starting token pairs with a closing
       token which may span multiple lines. i.e. the opening and closing
       braces of a programming language. Note that the opening and closing
       tokens must be different otherwise they cannot be differentiated. A
       bracket has two main effects:

       When the previous line has an unmatched open bracket
    
              In this situation the current line is indented to the right of the
              mismatched bracket.

       When the previous line has an unmatched close bracket
     
              In this situation the matching open bracket is hunted for in
              previous lines until either the look-back limit (See Indentation
              Method Creation) is exhausted or the bracket is matched, in which
              case the indent of that line is used.

        For a bracket the only other argument given is the cCclosecA. e.g. tcl's
       cCcG(cAcA and cCcG)cAcA brackets

sB
              indent .hilight.tcl b "(" ")"

sA
       Which produces:

              ....
              .... (....
                    ....
                    ....)
              ....


    cDContinuecA (cCtypecA = cCcGccAcA or cCcGCcAcA)
    
       Indicates that when cCtokencA is found on the current line, the next line
       is a continuation of the current line. The indentation of the next
       line is the indentation of the first continuation line plus the given
       cCindentcA. cCindentcA is the only argument specified. e.g. tcl's '\'

sB
              indent .hilight.tcl c "\\" 3/2t

sA    
       A simple example is

              ....
              12345678901234567890      \
                       ....
              ....


       When used in conjunction with brackets, the following effect is
       observed:

              ....
              12345678901234567890      \
                        ....(....       \
                             ....)      \
                        ....            \
                        ....
              ....


       This shows why the first continuation line (the cG123456...cA line) must
       be located and used as the base line from which the indentation is
       derived; again the cClook-backcA limits the search for this line.

    cDExclusioncA (cCtypecA = cCcGecAcA or cCcGEcAcA)
    
       Used to exclude text between start cCtokencA and cCclosecA token from the
       indentation calculation, typically used for quotes. The cCignorecA
       argument is also specified (see lshilight(2)lmhilight(2)le cGtype 0x004cA type bracket)
       e.g. MicroEmacs macro quotes:-

sB
              indent .hilight.emf e "\"" "\"" "\\"

sA    
       e.g. tcl's quotes

sB
              indent .hilight.tcl e "\"" "\"" "\\"

sA
       producing:-

              ....
              ".... ignore { ... \" ... ignore another { token ... "
              ....


    cDIgnorecA (cCtypecA = cCcGicAcA or cCcGIcAcA)
    
       Text to the right of a line containing cCtokencA is to be ignored;
       typically used for comments. e.g. MicroEmacs macro cCcG;cAcA comment:-

sB
              indent .hilight.emf i ";"

sA
       Or tcl's cCcG#cAcA comment

sB
              indent .hilight.tcl i "#"

sA
       producing

              ....
              # ... ignore this { indent token
              ....


    cDTypecA (cCtypecA = cCcGtcAcA or cCcGTcAcA)
 
       Used in a cDfast look-backcA indentation scheme (see bit cG0x02cA of cD0 indentcA
       above) to define the scheme change tokens. The fast look-back token
       typically shadows the cGxcA and cGwcA types and identifies the indentation
       scheme. The token itself does not change the indentation, it simply
       identifies the indentation scheme. The cCcGxcAcA or cCcGwcAcA types are used to
       perform the actual indentation of the line if required.

       If the cCindent-schemecA is defined as zero (cG0cA) then the indentation
       scheme is set to the same value as the ls$buffer-indent(5)lm$buffer-indent(5)le variable.

       The following example is taken from the XML language definition . A
       fast-look back scheme is used (cGhilight.xmlTcA) to search for the
       alternative indentation schemes for cCjavascriptcA and cCvbscriptcA. The cGtcA
       indent type defines the start of script tokens and to switch the
       indentation to the new indent type.

sB
              ; Fast look-back indentation scheme
              0 indent .hilight.xmlT 1 500
              ; Indentation scheme
              0 indent .hilight.xml 3 20 .hilight.xmlT

              !if &exist .indent.javascript
                  indent .hilight.xmlT t "<script ... javascript>"   .indent.javascript
                  indent .hilight.xml  x "<script ... javascript>" 2 .indent.javascript
                  indent .indent.javascript w "</script>" -2 0
              !endif
              !if &exist .indent.vbscript
                  indent .hilight.xmlT t "<script ... vbscript>"   .indent.vbscript
                  indent .hilight.xml  x "<script ... vbscript>" 2 .indent.vbscript

              indent .hilight.xmlT t "</script>" 0
              indent .hilight.xml  o "</script>" -2
              ; Define the indentation tokens. XML is well defined so there are
              ; always opening and closing brackets.
              indent .hilight.xml e "\"" "\"" "\\"
              indent .hilight.xml b "<!--" "-->"
              indent .hilight.xml b "<\\?" "\\?>"

    cDChangecA (cCtypecA = [cGxcA|cGXcA|cGwcA|cGWcA|cGvcA|cGVcA])
    
       Change the indentation scheme from the current scheme to the new
       cCindent-schemecA. If the cCindent-schemecA is specified as zero (cG0cA) then the
       indentation scheme is set to the same handle value as the
       ls$buffer-indent(5)lm$buffer-indent(5)le variable. indent specifies the indent value, when
       the cCtypecA is cGwcA then the current line onwards is indented (similar to
       cGocA), a cCtypecA of cGxcA indents the next line onwards (similar to cGncA), a cCtypecA
       of cGvcA indents both the current line and next time onwards (similar to
       cGucA).

       Refer the the cCtypecA=cGtcA for an example of indentation switching.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    Examples of indentation method creations can be found in macro files
    cGhkemf.emfcA, cGhktcl.emfcA and cGhkvrml.emfcA. The following example is taken from
    cGhkemf.emfcA:-

sB
          !if &not &exist .hilight.emf
              set-variable .hilight.emf &pinc .hilight.next 1
          !endif

          ...

          0 indent  .hilight.emf 0 10
          indent .hilight.emf N "define-macro" t
          indent .hilight.emf n "!if" t
          indent .hilight.emf s "!eli" -t
          indent .hilight.emf s "!els" -t

          indent .hilight.emf o "!don" -t
          indent .hilight.emf n "!rep" t
          indent .hilight.emf o "!until" -t
          indent .hilight.emf o "!ema" -t
          indent .hilight.emf e "\"" "\"" "\\"
          indent .hilight.emf i ";"
          indent .hilight.emf f "*" 0

sA
    Note that a cD.hilightcA command variable is typically used as a buffer with
    indentation rules will almost certainly have hilighting and the same
    variable is used to define the hilighting scheme.

    The variables ls$indent-width(5)lm$indent-width(5)le, ls$buffer-indent-width(5)lm$buffer-indent-width(5)le and the cDtcA indent
    notation were introduced in the November 2004 version of MicroEmacs.

    The electric C mode cDcmode(2m)cA was removed in December 2004, as were the

    cCncA cDforward-delete-charcA (cDC-dcA)  
    cCncA cDbackward-delete-charcA (cDbackspacecA)  


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDforward-delete-charcA deletes the next cCncA characters from the current cursor
    position. If the cursor is at the end of a line, the next line is joined
    onto the end of the current line. If a numeric argument is given the
    character(s) are added to the kill buffer, otherwise the kill buffer
    remains unaltered.

    cDbackward-delete-charcA deletes the next cCncA characters immediately to the left
    of the cursor (e.g. more conventionally backspace). If the cursor is at
    the beginning of a line, this joins the current line to the end of the
    previous line. If an argument is given then the character is added to the
    kill buffer, otherwise the kill buffer remains unaltered.

    Where the numeric argument is cG0cA the command has no effect. A negative
    argument changes the direction.


cENOTES cA


    cDforward-delete-charcA is also bound to cDdeletecA and cDS-deletecA.

    cDbackward-delete-charcA is also bound to cDS-backspacecA.


cEHISTORY cA


    As of December 2004 the mode cDletter(2m)cA which controlled whether the
    deleted character is added to the kill buffer was removed. Letter mode
    used to be disabled by default, the behavior of the old letter mode, when
    enabled, may be achieved through the key bindings:-

sB
          1 global-bind-key backward-delete-char "backspace"
          1 global-bind-key forward-delete-char "delete"

sA 
    The use of the numeric argument of 1 in the global binding has the has the
    same effect as the existing cDletter(2m)cA mode (when enabled).

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDforward-kill-wordcA deletes the next cCncA words starting at the current cursor
    position, the deleted text is added to the kill buffer. See
    lsforward-word(2)lmforward-word(2)le for a description of word boundaries. If no argument n is
    given and the current character is a non-word character then only the
    characters from the current position to the start of the next word are
    removed. If the argument cCncA is cG0cA the command has no effect. If a negative
    argument is specified, cCncA words are deleted backwards (i.e. this is the
    same as cD-n backward-kill-wordcA).

    cDbackward-kill-wordcA deletes the previous cCncA words before the cursor, the
    deleted text is added to the kill buffer. The numeric argument has the
    same effect as with cDforward-kill-wordcA.


cENOTES cA


    cDbackward-kill-wordcA is also bound to cDesc backspacecA.

    The negative argument is typically used by macro scripts where the kill
    buffer is more precisely controlled.


cEHISTORY cA


    The interpretation of the numeric argument was changed in the 2005 release
    to kill cCncA words in a forwards or backwards direction. In previous releases
    then the negative argument controlled the kill buffer behavior. If kill
    buffer control is required then lskill-region(2)lmkill-region(2)le should be used instead.

cEcENAME cEcA

$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDdelete-windowcA (cDC-x 0cA)  
    cCncA cDdelete-other-windowscA (cDC-x 1cA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDdelete-windowcA attempts to delete the current window (remove window from
    the screen), retrieving the lines for use in the window adjacent to it.
    The command fails if there is no other window or if the current window is
    protected from deletion (see ls$window-flags(5)lm$window-flags(5)le). The deletion protection
    can be overridden by giving the command a numerical argument cCncA of 2.

    The window deletion policy is determined by the formation of the windows
    displayed on the screen. The bias is for the cCpreviouscA window (above) the
    current window to be merged when split vertically, and for the left window
    to be merged when split horizontally.

    cDdelete-other-windowscA deletes all of the other windows, the current window
    becomes the only window, using the entire available screen area. Windows
    can be protected from deletion by using the ls$window-flags(5)lm$window-flagsle variable, giving
    the command a numerical argument cCncA of 2 overrides this protection.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDset-registrycA "cCrootcA" "cCvaluecA"  
    cC2cA cDset-registrycA "cCrootcA" "cCnew-namecA"


cEINTRODUCTION cA


    The cCregistrycA is a hierarchical tree of node names optionally with
    associated node values that is used for storing and retrieving values. The
    registry mechanism is used for saving and retrieving persistent user
    information between sessions.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDset-registrycA adds a new value or modifies an existing value in the
    registry. cCrootcA is an absolute path node name to the new entry. The first
    path component MUST exist or the call fails, subsequent path components (a
    cCcG/cAcA separated path) are created if they do not already exist. cCvaluecA is the
    value to assign to the node.

    If a numeric argument of 2 is specified the cCrootcA is renamed to cCnew-namecA,
    the cCrootcA must exist or the call fails. If the cCnew-namecA contains a path
    (i.e. cGcGnew/path/namecAcA) the registry node is moved to the new path which
    must be an existing absolute path, i.e. not relative to its current
    location.

    The value assigned to a node with cDset-registrycA may be retrieved using
    ls&reg(4)lm&reg(4)le.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following call (where the registry node cG/historycA already exists):

sB
          set-registry "/history/foo/win32/printer" "foo-bar"

sA
    constructs a registry hierarchy of the form:-

       "history" {
            "foo" {
              "win32" {
                "printer"="foo-bar";
              }
            }
       }


    The value of the registry node may be retrieved using:-

sB
          &reg "/history/foo/win32/printer"

sA
    which would return the value cGcGfoo-barcAcA.


cEHISTORY cA


    The cDget-registry(2)cA command was removed in January 2005 in preference to
    the ls&reg(4)lm&reg(4)le function, the existing get command was never used.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDexchange-point-and-markcA (cDC-x C-xcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDexchange-point-and-markcA moves the cursor to the current marked position
    (see lsset-mark(2)lmset-mark(2)le) in the current window and moves the mark to where the
    cursor was. This is very useful in finding where a mark was, or in
    returning to a position previously marked.

    The current buffer mark line and column position may be obtained from
    within a macro using the variables ls$window-mark-line(5)lm$window-mark-line(5)le and

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDexecute-buffercA executes script lines in the named buffer cCbuffer-namecA. If
    the buffer is off screen and an error occurs during execution, the cursor
    is left on the line causing the error.

    cDexecute-linecA executes a in script line entered from the command line.
    Typically this is used in macros.

    cDexecute-regioncA executes Macro commands in a marked buffer region.
    Typically this is used in macro development. Please note that all possible
    narrows, hidden regions,  are removed after execution, so show up again.

    execute-string - Execute a string as a command
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDexecute-stringcA "cCstringcA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDexecute-stringcA executes the given cCstringcA cCncA times as if it is being typed.
    This is the writable format of a keyboard macro, it can be placed in any
    cDemfcA file. Any characters may form the cCstringcA (unprintables as cG\xXXcA) and
    key-strokes that are bound to a command will execute that command. This
    command is used by macros to store user defined keyboard macros.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example uses keyboard strokes with cDexecute-stringcA in a macro
    to format cDnroff(1)cA text located between cG.cA commands:

sB
          define-macro nroff-para
              beginning-of-line
              !if &not &sequal @wc "."
                  1 buffer-mode "magic"
                  execute-string "\CXS^\\.\CM\CB\CM\CX\CH\CN\CM"
                  -1 fill-paragraph
                  execute-string "\CD\CX\CH\CN\CD\CXH\CB"
              !endif
              forward-line
          !emacro

sA
    cDexecute-stringcA has the advantage that execution is very fast as the amount
    of parsing and decoding to be performed is limited. The disadvantage is
    that you cannot quickly discern which operations are being performed !!


cENOTES cA


    Try to avoid using named key, such as cGcGupcAcA and cGcGreturncAcA, as the keyboard
    macro equivalent is not readable and is likely to change in future
    releases.

    For this reason the following special abbreviations may be used

    cD\EcA
    
       The "cDescapecA" key.

    cD\NcA
    
       The "cDreturncA" key.

    cD\TcA
 
       The "cDtabcA" key.

    cD\bcA
 
       The backspace character (0x08).

    cD\dcA

! 2 exit-emacs
cEcENAME cEcA


    exit-emacs - Exit MicroEmacs
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDexit-emacscA [cCexitCodecA]


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    Exit MicroEmacs back to the operating system. If no argument cCncA is given
    and there are any unwritten, changed buffers, the editor prompts the user
    to discard changes. If an argument is specified then MicroEmacs exits
    immediately.

    The numeric argument is defined as a bit-mask as follows:

    cG0x01cA
    
       Prompting the user before saving any files, writes out all changed
       buffers to the files they were read from. Saves all changed
       dictionaries, killing any running commands and exits the editor.

    cG0x02cA
    
       Writes out all changed buffers to the files they were read from, saves
       all changed dictionaries, killing any running commands and exits the
       editor. The behavior is modified by flags cG8cA and cG16cA.

    cG0x04cA

       Define the exit code cCexitCodecA from MicroEmacs, the default when
       omitted is 0.

    cG0x08cA

       Discard changed buffers (except the history and registry) and delete
       any backup files associated with the edited buffer(s). This mode does
       not operate when bit cG1cA is set.

    cG0x10cA
 
       Discard changed buffers (except the history and registry) and create a
       auto save file(s) with the changes from unsaved buffers. This mode
       does not operate when bit cG1cA is set.

    cG0x20cA
 
       Forces the program exit status to be 1 (non-zero), which is
       interpreted by any parent task as an error status.

    cDexit-emacscA may be used to reproduce the behavior of
    lssave-buffers-exit-emacs(2)lmsave-buffers-exit-emacs(2)le and lsquick-exit(2)lmquick-exit(2)le as follows:

 
       3 exit-emacs == save-buffers-exit-emacs
       2 exit-emacs == quick-exit


cEMACRO INTERACTION cA


    If the macro lsshut-down(3)lmshut-down(3)le is defined then it is invoked by the editor when
    it is closed. A user defined shutdown action may be associated with the
    close operation. It is the callers responsibility that the macro
    terminates correctly otherwise the editor will hang.


cENOTES cA


    All buffers with a name starting with a cCcG*cAcA are assumed to be system
    buffers (i.e. cD*scratch*cA) and are not saved.

    Modes cG8cA and cG16cA may be used where the user wishes to discard edited buffers
    on exiting and does not want to confirm the exit. Dictionaries should be
    configured to auto-save in lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le.

    An emergency exit command which forces the editor to quit may be
    implemented as cG0x28 exit-emacscA i.e. Force quit and exit with failed
    status. Internally this is what MicroEmacs uses to perform an emergency
    quit operation caused by signal fault etc.

! 2 fill-paragraph
cEcENAME cEcA


    fill-paragraph - Format a paragraph
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDfill-paragraphcA (cDesc ocA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDfill-paragraphcA this takes all the text in the current paragraph (as
    defined by surrounding blank lines, or a leading indent) and attempts to
    fill it from the left margin to the current fill column as defined by
    ls$buffer-fill-col(5)lm$buffer-fill-col(5)le. When an argument n is supplied n paragraphs are
    filled. If cCncA is positive then MicroEmacs 2009 performs indented filling
    (i.e. indentation for a bullet mark etc). If cCncA is negative then indented
    filling is disabled. If no argument cCncA is supplied then the paragraph is
    filled and the cCpointcA and cCmarkcA positions are retained. This allows
    paragraphs to be filled, whilst in the middle of the paragraph and the
    word position is maintained.

    If cDjustify modecA is enabled the variable ls$buffer-fill-mode(5)lm$buffer-fill-mode(5)le determines
    how the paragraph is filled (i.e. cCleftcA, cCrightcA, cCbothcA or cCcentercA). The
    variable ls$fill-eos-len(5)lm$fill-eos-len(5)le determines the trailing space used after a
    period (cG.cA) character (the trailing characters are specified by
    ls$fill-eos(5)lm$fill-eos(5)le), typically defined as 2.

    A set of characters defined by ls$fill-bullet(5)lm$fill-bullet(5)le enable bullet markers to be
    placed in the text at the beginning of the paragraph causing the left
    margin to be moved to the right of the bullet. The search depth for fill
    to locate a bullet character is defined by ls$fill-bullet-len(5)lm$fill-bullet-len(5)le. When the
    paragraph is formatted and one of the bullet characters is encountered
    then the user is prompted as to whether the paragraph should be indented
    following the marker or not. The point of indentation is shown with a cG<<<<cA
    marker.

    Filling is automatically disabled on paragraphs which start with
    characters in the ls$fill-ignore(5)lm$fill-ignore(5)le set.

    The simple text formatting is generally used for mail messages, ASCII text
    README files etc.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following examples show how the text is formatted with indented
    filling enabled and both justification enabled:-

       This  is  regular  text  that  is on the
       margin

              This is a regular  paragraph that is
              offset  from  the  margin.  Note how
              MicroEmacs 2009 retains the indent.

              * With  the  introduction  of one of
                the  special  characters,  in this
                case a  bullet,  a  format  of the
                paragraph  offsets  the text  from
                the bullet.

              1) Numbered  lists   are  the  same.
                 Note that the  paragraphs are all
                 separated with a blank line.

              1. Numbered  lists  ending  with   a
                 period.

              label - Or labeled lists, separated
                      with a dash.

              >  '>' might be an ignore
              >  character so it skips the paragraph
              >

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDfilter-buffercA executes one given operating system command, using the 
    contents of the current buffer as input, sending the results back to the
    same buffer, replacing the original text.

    This would typically be used in conjunction with cDsort(1)cA, cDawk(1)cA or cDsed(1)cA

$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDfind-filecA "cCfile-namecA" (cDC-x C-fcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDfind-filecA finds the named file cCfile-namecA. If it is already in a buffer,
    make that buffer active in the current window, otherwise attempt to create
    a new buffer and read the file into it.

    The numeric argument cCncA is used to modify the default behavior of the
    command, where the bits are defined as follows:

    cD0x01cA
    
       If the file does not exist and this bit is not set the command fails
       at this point. If the file does not exist and this bit is set (or no
       argument is specified as the default argument is cG1cA) then a new empty
       buffer is created with the given file name, saving the buffer
       subsequently creates a new file.

    cD0x02cA
    
       If this bit is set the file will be loaded with lsbinary(2m)lmbinary(2m)le mode
       enabled. See help on cDbinarycA mode for more information on editing
       binary data files.

    cD0x04cA
 
       If this bit is set the file will be loaded with lscrypt(2m)lmcrypt(2m)le mode
       enabled. See help on cDcryptcA mode for more information on editing
       encrypted files.

    cD0x08cA
 
       If this bit is set the file will be loaded with lsrbin(2m)lmrbin(2m)le mode enabled.
       See help on cDrbincA mode for more information on efficient editing of
       binary data files.

    cD0x10cA
 
       If this bit is set then the file hook evaluation is not performed when
       the file is loaded (i.e. the lsfileHooks(2)lmbuffer's file hookle is not executed).

    Text files are usually thought of as named collections of text residing on
    disk (or some other storage medium). In MicroEmacs 2009 the disk based
    versions of files come into play only when reading into or writing out
    buffers. The link between the physical file and the buffer is through the
    associated file name.

    MicroEmacs 2009 permits full file names, i.e. you can specify:

       disk:\directories\filename.extension


    or (UNIX)

       /directories/filename.extension


    If the disk and directories are not specified, the current buffers disk/
    directory is used. Several points should be noted in respect to the
    methods that MicroEmacs utilizes in the handling of files:-

    - Without explicitly saving the buffer(s) to file, all edits would be
            lost upon leaving MicroEmacs - you are asked to confirm whenever you
            are about to lose edits.

    - MicroEmacs has a mechanism for "protecting" your disk-based files
            from overwriting when it saves files. When instructed to save a
            file, it proceeds to dump the file to disk, making a backup of the
            existing file when lsbackup(2m)lmbackup(2m)le mode is enabled.

    - Auto-saving files can be performed on edited buffers by setting the
          ls$auto-time(5)lm$auto-time(5)le variable. The file is saved in the same place with a
            '#' appended to the file name. This can be used directly by the user
            or in the unlikely event of MicroEmacs crashing (or system crash),
            the files are automatically recovered next time it is edited.

    If you do not wish to perform any edits but merely browse the file(s), add
    the lsview(2m)lmview(2m)le mode to the buffer or ask for the file to be read in for
    lsview-file(2)lmviewingle only.


cERCS Support  cA


    If the file does not exist and the variable ls$rcs-file(5)lm$rcs-file(5)le is set then the
    existence of the RCS file is tested. If the rcs file exists then it will
    be checked out using a command-line created from the variable
    ls$rcs-co-com(5)lm$rcs-co-com(5)le. If the check-out is successful then this file is loaded.

    This raw interface for supporting file revision control systems has been
    adapted to support SCCS and Visual Source Safe see help on variable
    cD$rcs-filecA for more information and examples.


cEHTTP Support  cA


    MicroEmacs supports http file loading, this is available by default on
    UNIX systems but must be compiled in on win32 platforms (socket libraries
    not available on all win95 machines so cannot be compiled in by default).
    When available a http file can be loaded by simply executing cDfind-filecA and
    giving the http file name, i.e. cGcGhttp://user:password@address:port/filecAcA.
    Only the` http://`, cGaddresscA and cG/filecA components are mandatory, the rest can
    usually be omitted. e.g.:

       find-file "http://www.jasspa.com/index.html"


    See help page on ls%http-proxy-addr(5)lm%http-proxy-addr(5)le for information on HTTP proxy server
    support.


cEFTP support  cA


    MicroEmacs supports ftp file loading, this is identical to http except the
    prefix cGftp://cA is used as opposed to` http://`. The user name and password
    defaults to cCguestcA in the absence of both these fields. If the user name is
    supplied but not the password the password will be prompted for; this can
    be useful as the password will not be stored or written to the history
    file. Connection is by default on port 21.

       find-file "ftp://<me>:<password>@members.xoom.com/jasspa/index.html"


    See also lsftp(3)lmftp(3)le.

    The progress of the FTP transfer, and the FTP commands issued, may be
    viewed in the cG*ftp-console*cA buffer. This is popped up depending on the
    setting of the ls%ftp-flags(5)lm%ftp-flags(5)le variable.


cENOTES cA


    The base name part (i.e. not the path) of cGfile-namecA can contain wild-card
    characters compatible with most file systems, namely:-

    cD?cA
 
       Match any character.

    cD[abc]cA
 
       Match character only if it is cCacA, cCbcA or cCccA.

    cD[a-d]cA
 
       Match character only if it is cCacA, cCbcA, cCccA or cCdcA.

    cD[^abc]cA
 
       Match character only if it is not cCacA, cCbcA or cCccA.

    cD*cA
 
       Match any number of characters.

    If the name matches more than one file, a buffer will be created for each
    matching file. Note that these are not the same wild-card characters used
    by lsRegularExpressions(2)lmregexle.

    For cCftpcA and cChttpcA then a ftp console window is opened up to show the
    progress of the transfer (when configured), this is described in lsftp(3)lmftp(3)le.

! 2 find-tag
cEcENAME cEcA


    find-tag - Find tag, auto-load file and move to tag position
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDfind-tagcA "cCstringcA" (cDesc tcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDfind-tagcA finds the current or given tag (cCstringcA) in a cDtagscA file and goes
    to the given point, loading the file if necessary. The tag is either the
    current word under the cursor or a user supplied word if the cursor is not
    in a word. The buffer containing the tag is popped up in another window
    and the cursor moved to the tag in the new window.

    A cDtagscA file is usually created by an external program (e.g. cDctags(1)cA)
    which stores word references (or tags) and the name of the file containing
    the tag, with a search string to go to its local. It is an indexing system
    which is often used in programming.

    The argument cCncA can be used to change the default behavior of find-tag
    described above, cCncA is a bit based flag where:-

    cD0x01cA
 
       Use popup-window to display the tag in a different window (default)
       when this flag is not given the current window is used to display the
       tag.

    cD0x02cA
 
       Disable the use of the current cursor position to determine the tag.
       Instead the tag must always be supplied through "cCstringcA".

    cD0x04cA
 
       Find the next definition of the last tag (multiple tag support). This
       feature can only be used if multiple tag support is enabled (see flag
       'cDmcD' of variable ls%tag-option(5)lm%tag-option(5)le) and cAfind-tagcA has already been
       successfully executed. In this situation the last invocation of
       find-tag defines the current tag and executing again with an argument
       of cG4cA will jump to the next definition of the current tag or return the
       message "`[No more "<current>" tags]`".

       The next tag is typically bound to cGM-C-tcA.

    The cDtagscA file is, by default, assumed to reside in the current directory
    of the currently viewed file. The user variable ls%tag-option(5)lm%tag-option(5)le may be
    specified with a value of cCcGrcAcA (recursive) and cCcGccAcA (continue) flags, which
    ascends the directory tree from the current directory and attempts to
    locate a cCrecursivelycA generated tags file at a higher directory level.
    Recursive tag files are generally easier to maintain where project source
    files are located in a number of project sub-directories, and enable the
    whole of the project tree to be taggable.

    Two user variables must be defined before cDfind-tagcA will execute, if either
    ls%tag-file(5)lm%tag-file(5)le or ls%tag-template(5)lm%tag-template(5)le are not defined the error message 
    "[tags not setup]" is signaled.


cENOTES cA


    A cDtagscA file may be generated by MicroEmacs 2009 from the menu (Tools->XX
    Tools->Create Tags File). Alternatively a cDtagscA file may be generated by
    the cDctags(1)cA utility. This is typically standard on UNIX platforms. For
    Windows and DOS platforms then the cDExuberant CtagscA is recommended, this is
    available from:-

      ` http://darren.hiebert.com`

    A MicroEmacs 2009 compatible tags file may be generated using the command
    line "`ctags -N --format=1 ."` cataloging the current directory. To generate
    cDtagscA for a directory tree then use cG`ctags -NR -format=1 .`cA. Refer to the
    cDExuberant CtagscA documentation for a more detailed description of the
    utility.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDget-next-linecA (cDC-x `cA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDget-next-linecA is typically used in conjunction with the lscompile(3)lmcompile(3)le and
    lsgrep(3)lmgrep(3)le commands to enable the user to step through errors/locations one
    by one. The command looks for lines in the form defined by
    lsadd-next-line(2)lmadd-next-line(2)le in the order of definition. If a match is found the
    command attempts to find the next error or warning found from the current
    location (See lscompile(3)lmcompile(3)le). If the buffer was not found then the next
    buffer set is searched for, and if found then the next expression from the
    cursor is automatically located. The command fails if none of the buffers
    exist, or the end of the buffer is reached.

    cDgoto-alpha-markcA "cC?cA" (cDC-x acA)  
    cC0cA cDgoto-alpha-markcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDgoto-alpha-markcA prompts user for an alpha character and sets the cursor
    position to the preset location. Alpha marks are specified on a per buffer
    basis, thus the current buffer is not changed, merely the current location
    in the buffer. The alpha mark must already be defined using
    lsset-alpha-mark(2)lmset-alpha-mark(2)le. This functionality is useful for rapidly returning back
    to locations in large files.

    cDgoto-alpha-markcA with a numeric argument of zero (0) returns a string
    containing all of the alpha marks that exist in the current buffer. The
    alpha mark string is returned in ls$result(5)lm$result(5)le, this is an empty string if
    there are no alpha marks in the buffer.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDgoto-linecA (cDesc gcA)  
    cDgoto-linecA "cCnumcA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDgoto-linecA moves the cursor to the specified line in the buffer. The user
    is prompted for the new line number on the command line, which may be
    entered as a relative displacement ([cG+cA|cG-cA]cCnumbercA) from the current
    position, or as an absolute line number (cCnumbercA). If the number is
    preceded by cG+cA or cG-cA then this is treated as a relative displacement from
    the current line, otherwise it is an absolute line number.

    If a positive argument cCncA is supplied, cDgoto-linecA moves to this line, e.g.
    to move the cursor to line 240:

sB
          240 goto-line

sA
    A special case of cDgoto-linecA is operative if an argument of cG0cA is supplied,
    argument "cCnumcA" must also be given as above except cDgoto-linecA treats the
    line number or displacement as an absolute move, i.e. includes narrowed
    out sections when calculating the new position. If the new line lies
    within a narrowed out section (i.e. a section that has been hidden and is
    not visible on the screen) the narrow is automatically expanded. See
    lsnarrow-buffer(2)lmnarrow-buffer(2)le for more information on narrowing.

    Supplying a negative argument to goto-line results in an error.

    goto-matching-fence - Move the cursor to specified line
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDgoto-matching-fencecA (cDesc C-fcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDgoto-matching-fencecA moves the cursor to the opposing fence character of
    the character currently under the cursor. The set of fence characters
    include cG[ ... ]`, `{ ... }`, `( ... )cA and `< ... >`. i.e. if the character under
    the cursor is `cG{cA' then cDgoto-matching-fencecA moves the cursor to the
    matching closing `cG}cA' fence, and visa versa.

    cDgoto-matching-fencecA can also be used to move to a matching cG' ... 'cA and 
    "... " fence, but, as the start and end fence is the same, bit cG0x04cA must be
    used to indicate whether the current fence is the open or close fence, see
    below.

    cDgoto-matching-fencecA can also be used to move the cursor between the start
    and end of a C/C++ cG/* ... */cA style comment. It can also be used to move to
    matching C/C++ cG#ifcA, cG#elifcA, cG#elsecA and cG#endifcA constructs, cycling through
    them in the given order.

    The numeric argument cCncA is used to modify the default behavior of the
    command, where the bits are defined as follows:

    cD0x01cA
 
       When this bit is set (the default) the terminal bell is rung if the
       matching fence cannot be found.

    cD0x02cA
 
       When this bit is set the command moves the cursor to the matching
       fence, updates the screen and pauses for ls$pause-time(5)lm$pause-time(5)le before moving
       the cursor back again. When omitted the cursor is simply moved to the
       matching fence.

    cD0x04cA
 
       When this bit is set the fence the cursor is current at is treated as
       the close fence so cDgoto-matching-fencecA moves backwards through the
       file looking for the matching open fence. When this bit is omitted the
       fence is assumed to be the open fence, this bit is only used for cG'cA and
       cG"cA type fences.

    When the lsfence(2m)lmfence(2m)le buffer mode is enabled the matching open fence is
    automatically displayed when the closing fence is typed. The length of
    time the matching fence is displayed for can be controlled by the
    ls$pause-time(5)lm$pause-time(5)le variable.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDlist-commandscA constructs a list of all known built in commands and macros
    that are currently defined by MicroEmacs 2009 and presents a list of those
    commands in the buffer "cD*commands*cA". Each entry is formatted as:-

         command ......................... keyCode

    Where multiple keys are bound to the same command, then each of the
    cCkeyCodecA's is shown.

    cDlist-commandscA only displays visible commands, if a numeric argument cCncA of 0
    is given then all commands are displayed, irrespective of their hidden
    status.

    cDlist-commandscA is similar to lsdescribe-bindings(2)lmdescribe-bindings(2)le except that the commands
    are presented in alphabetical order (as opposed to key binding order).

       the current line indentation or inserts a tab.

    cDtabcA
 
       If a tab is to be inserted and this mode is enabled then multiple

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The help commands provide a quick on-line help facility within MicroEmacs
    2009 without invoking a third party documentation system (e.g. a browser
    such as cDNetscape(1)cA or cDwinhelp(1)cA).

    The on-line help is assisted by a set of macros which enable key words
    within the help buffers to be located by either tagging (cGesc tcA) or by
    selection with the left mouse button. The tag mechanism supports command
    completion.

    cDhelpcA provides general help on the philosophy and functionality of
    MicroEmacs 2009, if an argument cCncA of 0 is given to the command it changes
    the current buffer to the internal help buffer, typically named "*on-line help*". 
    This is a lshide(2m)lmhiddenle system buffer used to store all the on-line help
    and can be used for a variety of things. Note that access to this buffer
    must be via the cDhelpcA command, not cDfind-buffercA and the help command will
    also ensure the system help file is loaded first.

    cDhelp-commandcA describes the purpose of the given cCcommandcA.

    cDhelp-variablecA Describes the purpose of the given cCvariablecA, similar to
    cDhelp-commandcA, only for variables.

    cDhelp-itemcA Describes the purpose of any given item, where item could be a
    command, variable or any aspect of MicroEmacs 2009.


cEFILES cA


    The help files are ASCII text files located in the MicroEmacs 2009 home
    directory. The files are defined as follows:-

    cGme.ehfcA - Help text file.

cEMain Menu-Bar Status  cA


    cDosdcA cD-1cA cCflagcA

    This invocation determines the state of the top main menu bar. The state
    is set by the argument cCflagcA defined as:-

               1 - enable.
               0 - disable.
              -1 - disable and destroy.

    [["title-bar-scheme"] ["Text"]] ["resize-command"] ["control-command"]
    ["init-command"]

    This invocation creates or resets the base properties of dialog cCncA. The
    cCflagscA argument determines the arguments and are defined as follows:

        cDAcA
 
              Defines dialog as an alpha type dialog, items are added according
              to their string text value. Alpha dialogs may not have separator
              or child items.

        cDicA
 
              Used with the A flag, sets the alpha ordering to be case
              insensitive.

       cDGcA

             Create a Grid dialog. Every item in the dialog is given a single
              character boarder around it. If one of the dialogs items is also
              given a 'G' flag, the boarder is drawn as a box around it,
              otherwise spaces are used.

       cDNcA

             Create a Note-Book (or tabs) dialog. The dialog can only contain
              one dialog inclusion item ('I') and Note-Book pages ('P'). Pages
              added before the Inclusion item (page item number is lass than the
              inclusion page item number) will be drawn at the top of the
              note-book, those added after will be drawn at the bottom.

       cDbcA

             Draw boarder, draws a boarder around the outside of the dialog.
              See also flag t (title) as flag effects the boarder.

       cDacA

             Defines the absolute start-up position of the dialog in the
              arguments x-pos and y-pos, which are the column and row positions
              respectively of the dialog from the top left-hand corner of the
              display. The arguments must be specified. e.g. the main menu is
              defined with an absolute position of (0,0). If the dialog can not
              be fully drawn on the screen at the given position it will be
              moved to a position which shows the most.

       cDocA

             Specifies an offset to the dialog position calculated by
              MicroEmacs in the arguments x-pos and y-pos, which are the column
              and row offsets. This flag is ignored when flag a is also
              specified. If the dialog can not be fully drawn on the screen at
              the new position it will be moved to a position which shows the
              most.

       cDscA

             Sets the size of the dialog. osd automatically resizes a dialog to
              fit the contents, this flag should be considered as a size hint
              for osd, and is not guaranteed to be honored. If the dialog has a
              boarder (flag b) the size given should include the boarder size.

          The arguments, min-width, min-depth, max-width and max-depth must
           be specified, as

              +ve
                  The actual size of the dialog, minimum and maximum sizes.

                  min value should be specified as desired window size, max may
                  be 0 which specifies the screen size.

              -ve
                  min defines the maximum size. max is unlimited.

          The following table shows possible combination of the sing
           parameters and their effect:-

              min=0, max=0
                  Default setting, makes dialog as small as possible, with a
                  maximum size of the screen.

              min=0, max=50
                  Make dialog as small as possible with a max of 50 characters.

              min=50, max=0
                  Make dialog as small as possible, but make it at least 50
                  characters big and no larger than the screen.

              min=30, max=-1
                  Make dialog at least 30 characters big with no upper limit,
                  very useful for dialogs being used as scrolled children.

              min=-1, max=50
                  Make dialog 50 characters big.

              min=-1, max=0
                  Make dialog the same size as the screen.

              min=-1, max=-1
                  Make dialog as big as possible (do not do this unless you have
                  a large amount of memory to throw away).

           Binds a command to the dialog, which is automatically executed
            when the dialog is opened. When the dialog with a C attribute is
            opened, it is rendered on the screen and then a command, defined
            by control-command is invoked, when the command completes the
            dialog is closed.  
            The command dialog is typically used to create status messages.
            e.g. a "Busy - Please Wait" dialog box, such a dialog may be
            implemented when saving the current buffer then create the simple
            dialog and sent the control-command to lssave-buffer(2)lmsave-buffer(2)le.
            The dialog would be defined as:-

sB
                  osd 200 0 "btcHC" %osd-title-scheme "Saving Buffer" save-buffer
                  osd 200 1 ""
                  osd 200 2 "" "Busy - Please Wait"
                  osd 200 3 ""
                  200 osd

sA
             If the dialog has buttons which need to become active then control
              can be returned to osd by calling osd with no arguments, e.g. in
              the above example the dialog can be made to stay on the screen
              until the user selects okay by:

sB
                  define-macro test-osd
                      save-buffer

              This flag also disables the normal hot-keys for the dialog, so all
              text strings are copied literally.

              characters big.

       If "cCinit-commandcA" is given then this function is always called just
       prior to the dialog being displayed so it can be used to configure the

             Item is a check-box. The setting of the check-box is evaluated
              when the dialog is first drawn, re-draw and whenever any item is
              executed. A "command" must be specified which must both return the
              current setting when the given argument (of 1) is given (!abort if
              false, !return if true) and change the value if the argument value
              is negated. The text string must also be specified, the first 6
              characters are used in the drawing of the check box. The format
              can be shown as follows:-

                  String\State       Off         On
                  "123456"            "12356"     "12456"

                  "^^^^^^"            ""          ""


             Note that no character is rendered when a '^' character is used.
              See also p for prepending the check-box.

       cDpcA

             Prepend the check-box box. By default a check box is drawn as:

                  "Check box12?56"


             This option changes it to:

                  "12?56Check box"

              similar fashion to lsexecute-line(2)lmexecute-line(2)le. Note that if an argument is
              required it is usually specified in the string, i.e.

sB

sA
             writes the argument (i.e. 5) for 1 second.

sB
                  osd "i" "text" 5 "my-command"

sA
             in this case my-command will not be given an argument,

sB
                  osd "i" "text" 5 "10 my-command"

sA
             in this case my-command will be given an argument of 10,

sB
                  osd "i" "text" 5 "@# my-command"

sA
             in this case my-command will be given an argument of 5.

                  osd ""  "2nd on line"

sA
             Will produce "1st on line 2nd on line". If there is not enough
              room on a single dialog line to display all the horizontally added
              items then the line is split and as many lines as needed are used.

       cDccA

             Center the text for the item in the middle of the dialog.

       cDrcA

             Right hand justify the text for the item.

       cDtcA

             Set the item to be in the tab order of the dialog. The order of
              tab items in the dialog is auto-generated, based on item i
              numbers.

             Child inclusion is a scroll box type. By default a child inclusion
              simply draws the whole child dialog at the position. If this flag
              is specified then arguments "width" and "depth" must also be
              supplied and a window displaying "width" by "depth" of the child
              is created. The size of this item will be "width"+1+ss by
              "depth"+1+ss where ss is the scroll bar size which is 1 or 2
              depending on the setting of ls$scroll-bar(5)lm$scroll-bar(5)le. It is up to the user
              to ensure that the child dialog being displayed is at least
              "width" by "depth" characters in size, if this is not true then
              the effect is undefined, (a crash dump is not out of the

              Check-boxes, the command given must both return and set the value
              depending on value of the argument given. The value must be
              returned in ls$result(5)lm$result(5)le if the given argument (or 1 for 'f') is
              given, and the value must be set (usually using ls@ml(4)lm@ml(4)le or ls@mc(4)lm@mc(4)le)
              if the argument is negated. The absolute value of the argument is

             Item is a read-only Combo-box type of entry. As with entry items
              (type E) the command given must return the current value to be
              displayed in the entry box when it is called with a non-negated
              argument. However, when the entry box is selected the item behaves
              like a sub-menu (type M), the command is called (with a negated
              argument) which can be used to create the sub-menu. The type of
              item is often used with a button item (type B) to the right of it
              which also opens the sub-menu by executing this item.

             Item is a Button type. Add the last 2 characters of
              ls$window-chars(5)lm$window-chars(5)le to the text string given, one on each side, i.e.
              if the last two chars are "[]" then:

sB
                  osd "B" " Okay "

             Item is a repeat type, this is typically used with buttons,
              altering their execution behavior. By default an item is only
              executed when the left mouse button is released while over the
              item. However when this flag is specified the item is executed as
              soon as the left mouse button is pressed and is repeatedly
              executed until the button is release or the mouse moves off the
              item. The delay between repeated executions is determined by the
              variables ls$delay-time(5)lm$delay-time(5)le and ls$repeat-time(5)lm$repeat-time(5)le.

             Item is a separator type. This is not often required as any item
              without anything to execute is automatically set to be a
              separator. Occasionally a mouse-insensitive item which can be
              executed is required, typically a text string with a hot key, e.g.

sB
                  osd 200 1  "S" " \HEnter text" 2
                  osd 200 2  "ExHf" %osd-entry-scheme "########" 1 my-entry-set

sA
             will be drawn as "[ Okay ]". The hot-key is denoted by \H so for
              osd item 1 then this is the E of Enter.

             Item 1 will have a hot-key which executes item 2 (as no command is
              given), but it will not hi-light if the mouse is placed over it.

       cDRcA

             Redraw dialog. Forces a redraw of the dialog when the item is
              executed. This is not usually required as osd generally works out
              for itself whether a redraw is needed, however, sometimes it does
              not, most notably when the item sets a variable that is displayed
              by another item as an entry, e.g.

sB
                  set-variable %entry-value "Hello world"

                      !else
                          set-variable $result %entry-value
                      !endif
                  !emacro

                  osd 200 1  "S" " \HEnter text" 2
                  osd 200 2  "ExHf" %osd-entry-scheme "########" 1 my-entry-set
                  osd 200 3  "BxHcfiR" %osd-ebtt-scheme  " \HReset " f "set-variable %entry-value\"\""

sA
             If item 3 did not have flag R set when executed, osd would not
              realize that the change to value %entry-value affects the display
              and the button would not appear to operate.

       cDHcA

             Sets the item color scheme. Note that for scrolled child items
              this only sets the scroll-box color scheme, the dialog scheme is
              used for the rest of the boarder.

       cDucA

             Disables the high-lighting of the item when the mouse is over it.

       cDGcA

             This flag is only applicable in grid dialogs (see flag G in dialog
              creation). The current item will be drawn with a box around it
              using ls$box-chars(5)lm$box-chars(5)le.

       cDzcA

             Sets the item size, arguments "width" and "depth" must be given.

       cDNcA

             This flag only has an effect on entry item types, it selects
              'New-line' style text entry which allows the user to enter
              multiple line of text using the return key and to end the input
              using the tab key.

       Note that for a non-sub-menu item type, if an argument is given with
       no command then it is assumed that the number given is the item number
       to be executed, see flag cDScA for an example.


cEDialog Execution  cA


    cCncA cDosdcA

    This invocation with a single positive numeric argument executes the cCncAth
    dialog.


cEReturning Command Control  cA


    cC-4cA cDosdcA

    An invocation of cDosdcA with an argument of -4 returns control back to the
    cDosdcA from a cCcontrol-commandcA. Refer to the cDCcA flag in the create/reset dialog
    property for information and an example.


cECurrent Dialog Redraw  cA


    cC-2cA cDosdcA

    Calling osd with an argument of -2 forces the complete redrawing of
    current dialog and any sub-dialogs. This is very useful when the execution
    of one item may effect the appearance of another.


cERedraw All Active Dialogs  cA


    cC-3cA cDosdcA

    Calling osd with an argument of -3 forces the complete redrawing of all
    currently active osd dialogs. This is better than calling lsscreen-update(2)lmscreen-update(2)le
    when only the osd dialogs need updating as it suffers less from
    flickering.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDshow-cursorcA hides the cursor if a negative argument is given and restores
    it if a positive or no argument is given. Note that this is not supported
    on all platforms.

    cDshow-cursorcA internally performs a counting operation, if the cursor is
    hidden cCmcA times then it must also be shown cCmcA times before the cursor
    becomes visible again, giving no argument will restore the count ensuring
    it is visible.
! 2 narrow-buffer
cEcENAME cEcA


    narrow-buffer - Hide buffer lines
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDnarrow-buffercA  
     n cDnarrow-buffercA [cCline-schemecA] ["_out-markup-line_" |
           "to-top-markup-line" "to-bottom-markup-line"] ["markup-command"]


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDnarrow-buffercA command allows lines in a buffer to be hidden
    (effectively folded up) the scope of the narrow is defined by a region. A
    region is the text located between the cDpointcA (the current cursor position)
    and the cDmarkcA defined by lsset-mark(2)lmset-markle.

    cDnarrow-buffercA supports two types of information hiding. A simple cCNarrowcA or
    cCNarrowcA cCOutcA hides lines of the region from display and optionally inserts a
    new line, called a mark-up line. The mark-up line allows the narrow
    position to be annotated with a line scheme color and annotation text
    providing a visual representation of the narrow i.e.

       Before Narrow Out           After Narrow Out
       ________________________________________________________________

       ... buffer text ...        ... buffer text ..
       <region start>              <Optional Narrow Out line mark-up>
       .... region text ...       ... more buffer text ...
       <region end>
       ... more buffer text ...


    The second narrow form is a cCNarrow TocA hides text around the region leaving
    the region displayed only. A cCNarrow OutcA will optionally show a mark-up
    line at both the top and bottom of the region. The mark-up line allows the
    cCNarrowcA cCTocA position to be annotated in the buffer with a line scheme color
    and annotation text providing a visual representation of the narrow i.e.

       Before Narrow To            After Narrow To
       ________________________________________________________________

       ... buffer text ...        <Optional Narrow Out top mark-up>
       <region start>              <region start>
       .... region text ...       .... region text ...
       <region end>                <region end>
       ... more buffer text ...   <Optional Narrow Out bottom mark-up>


    Once a narrow has been created and information has been hidden
    cDnarrow-buffercA may be used to subsequently reveal the hidden text on a line
    or complete buffer basis.

    Narrowed regions do not delete the text contained within the buffer the
    information is simply hidden. Saving the buffer using lssave-buffer(2)lmsave-buffer(2)le, by
    default, writes both the displayed and hidden information the command may
    be optionally invoked to save only the visible representation.

    While information is hidden in a narrow lscopy-region(2)lmcopy-region(2)le and lskill-region(2)lmkill-region(2)le
    operate as expected. If a narrow is copied then all of the information
    that is contained within the narrow is also copied to the new location.
    Similarly killing or deleting a narrow removes all of the information that
    is contained within the narrow.

    cDnarrow-regioncA performs the low-level information hiding and is used from
    the macro command language, the command is not generally invoked directly
    by the user. Within the macro environment the location of narrows in any
    buffer may be determined using the line variable ls$line-flags(5)lm$line-flags(5)le. This
    variable allows the narrow state of the current line in a buffer to be
    determined. The narrow state of a buffer may be determined with
    lsnarrow(2m)lmnarrow(2m)le. When a narrow is created the buffer mode lsnarrow(2m)lmnarrow(2m)le is
    automatically set, when the last narrow is removed the mode is deleted.

    The effect of cDnarrow-buffercA depends on the given argument and is defined
    as follows:-

    cG1cA
    
       Removes all narrows in the current buffer (the default), it aborts if
       there are no narrows in the buffer.

    cG2cA
    
       Removes the current line's narrow, it aborts if there is no narrow at
       the current line.

    cG3cA

        Narrow to region hides all but the lines of text in the current buffer
       from the lsset-mark(2)lmmarkle position to the current cursor position, effectively
       'narrowing' the buffer to the remaining text.

    cG4cA
 
       Narrow out region hides the lines of text in the current buffer from
       the lsset-mark(2)lmmarkle position to the current cursor position. This is the inverse
       effect of argument cD3cA.

    The second form of the command takes a variable number of arguments which
    are determined by the value of cCncA when bits in the range cG0x0ff0cA are
    defined. These bits are interpreted as a bit-mask and determine how the
    narrow is to be visually displayed to the user. When these bits are set
    then a mark-up line is created.

    cG0x0010cA - cCline-schemecA
    
       Bit cG0x0010cA specifies the line lshilight(2)lmhilight(2)le color scheme to be used on
       the narrow line when it is an open or closed narrow. The scheme colors
       used are defined by the scheme variables cGscheme.fold-opencA and
       cGscheme.fold-closedcA.

    cG0x0020cA - "cCout-markup-linecA" | "cCto-top-markup-linecA" "cCto-bottom-markup-linecA"
    
       Bit cG0x0020cA specifies that mark-up text is used, the text mark up is
       passed into the call. The number of arguments is determined by the
       type of markup operation (cCtocA/cCoutcA). The arguments are placed on the
       mark-up lines.

    cG0x0040cA - "cCmarkup-commandcA"
    
       Bit cG0x0040cA specifies that a mark-up line is used to represent the
       narrow region. When the narrow region is created then the
       cCmarkup-commandcA macro is executed to annotate the narrowed region. The
       macro is invoked when the narrow is created and is passed a numeric
       argument cCncA which identifies the operation of the narrow. The numeric
       argument to the mark-up macro is defined below, generally a positive
       argument means that a narrow is being added and negative means that
       the narrow is being removed.

       cG1cA - This is a cCNarrow OutcA line.  
       cG2cA - This is the top of a cCNarrow TocA.  
       cG3cA - This is the bottom of a cCNarrow TocA.

       When the macro is executed then the current line is the start of the
       narrow region, the text of the line is available to the macro via
       ls@wl(4)lm@wl(4)le. The markup-command aborts, using ls!abort(4)lm!abort(4)le if the mark-up line
       is to be removed, otherwise returns a mark-up line in the variable
       ls$result(5)lm$result(5)le.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    For example, if the buffer contains the following text:

       1 Richmond
       2 Lafayette
       3 Bloomington
       4 Indianapolis
       5 Gary
       6


    If the mark is on line 2 and the current point is on line 4, executing:-

sB
          4 narrow-buffer

sA
    Creates one narrow, narrowing out lines 2 and 3, line 4 becomes the narrow
    anchor line. When the narrow is removed lines 2 and 3 will be inserted
    before line 4. The buffer will become:-

       1 Richmond
       4 Indianapolis
       5 Gary


    If instead the following command was executed:-

sB
          3 narrow-buffer

sA
    Two narrows are created, the first narrowing out lines 4 and 5 (line 6,
    the last line, being the anchor line) the second narrowing out line 1
    (line 2 being the anchor line). The buffer will become:-

       2 Lafayette
       3 Bloomington
       6


    Executing cDnarrow-buffercA with an argument of cD2cA will only work on the anchor
    lines, namely 4 in the first example and 2 and 6 in the second.


cEMarking Up  cA


    A pseudo line may be created by cDnarrow-buffercA which is hilighted and
    annotated to show that a narrow exists. This markup is used in the
    language templates in the collapse operations (cGcollapse.emfcA) to show that
    a narrow exists. The narrow region is applied using the cDnarrow-buffercA
    command as follows:-

sB
          0x34 narrow-buffer .scheme.fold-close collapse-markup

sA
    This defines a narrow region with a color scheme mark-up. The mark-up line
    is annotated by the macro cGcollapse-markupcA once the narrow is created. The
    macro is defined as follows:-

sB
          0 define-macro collapse-markup
              !if &les @# 0
                  ; no markup line modificaton
                  !abort
              !endif
              set-variable $result &cat &trr &lef @wl 40 " ..."
          !emacro

sA 
    The cGcollapse-markupcA macro process the numeric argument lsMacroArguments(4)lm@#(4)le to determine
    the mark-up type to be applied to the buffer. When the numeric argument is
    negative then ls!abort(4)lm!abort(4)le is called to remove the mark-up. When the numeric
    argument is positive then a mark-up line annotation is created by taking
    the first 40 characters of the line and appending cGcG...cAcA to indicate that
    this is a narrow. The original cDnarrow-buffercA call included a lshilight(2)lmhilight(2)le
    line scheme so the resultant mark-up line will be hilighted and show the
    first 40 characters of the defined followed by an ellipsis.


cENOTES cA


    Alpha mark set by lsset-alpha-mark(2)lmset-alpha-mark(2)le in text which is subsequently narrowed
    out will automatically remove the narrow if the user returns to the mark
    using lsgoto-alpha-mark(2)lmgoto-alpha-mark(2)le.

    lsget-next-line(2)lmget-next-line(2)le operates on the unnarrowed buffer and will remove any
    narrows hiding the 'next' line.

    When copying a region containing a narrowed region(s) with lscopy-region(2)lmcopy-region(2)le
    then the content of the narrowed region(s) is also copied. A numeric
    argument to lscopy-region(2)lmcopy-region(2)le may be used to change the behavior to copy the
    visual representation only.

    cC-1cA cDhilightcA "cChil-nocA" "cCtypecA" "cCtokencA"  


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDhilightcA command creates and manages the buffer hilighting, the process
    of creating a new hilighting scheme is best described in 
    lslanguageTemplates(2)lmFile Language Templatesle. 
    The command takes various forms as defined by the arguments.
    Each of the argument configurations is defined as follows:-


cEHilight Scheme Creation  cA


    cC0cA cDhilightcA "cChil-nocA" "cCflagscA" [ "cCnolcA" ] [ "cCbuffer-schemecA" [ "cCtrunc-schemecA" ] ]

    With an argument of cG0cA, cDhilightcA initializes or re-initializes the hilight
    scheme cChil-nocA (1-255). Every buffer has a hilight scheme, the default is 0
    which means no hi-lighting and only the ls$global-scheme(5)lm$global-scheme(5)le etc. are used.
    The hilighting scheme must be defined before use and is used to specify
    how the buffer is to be hilighted. MicroEmacs 2009 supports the following
    hilighting concepts:-

    - cDhilight stringcA, a user specified string is hilighted in any color
          scheme.
    - cDTokenscA, same as a hilight string except that the string must be
          enclosed in non alpha-numeric characters.
    - cDStart-of-line hilightscA, the start of the hilight must be the first
          non-white character of the line.
    - cDEnd-of-Line hilightscA, the hilight starts from the current position
          and continues until the end of the line. Optionally, the hilight may
          continue onto the next line if the current line ends in a given
          string. A bracket may also be searched for within the line.
    - cDBracket hilightcA, hi-lights from the current position until the
          closing bracket token is found.
    - cDReplace string cA, allows the hilight string to be replaced with a
          different user specified string. (i.e. the displayed representation
          is different from the buffer contents)

    Terminals that cannot display color directly may still be able to take
    advantage of the hi-lighting. A terminal that has fonts (i.e. cCTermcapcA) can
    use them in the same way using the lsadd-color-scheme(2)lmadd-color-scheme(2)le command. The
    hi-light scheme is also used in printing (see lsprint-buffer(2)lmprint-buffer(2)le). If your
    terminal cannot display color in any way, it is recommended that
    hi-lighting is disabled (except when printing) as it does take CPU time.

    The "cChil-nocA" argument specifies which hi-lighting scheme is being
    initialized. Once a hilighting scheme has been initialized, hi-light
    tokens can be added to it and it can be used by setting the current
    buffer's ls$buffer-hilight(5)lm$buffer-hilight(5)le variable to "cChil-nocA". The "cCflagscA" argument is
    a bit based flag setting global hi-light characteristics, 
    where:- 


    cD0x01cA

      The hi-light scheme is case insensitive, i.e. the following tokens
      become equivalent:-

              house == HOUSE == hOuSe

       When the hilight scheme is attributed as case insensitive then the
       tokens must cDallcA be specified in cDlowercA case.

    cD0x02cA

       Set a hi-light look-back. During the process of determining the window
       hilighting then the hilight process has to determine whether the top
       of the window starts in a hi-light bracket or not. The look-back
       command tries looking "cCnolcA" lines backwards for an open bracket. If an
       open bracket is found then the top of the window is assumed to start
       with that bracket, else it is assumed that the top of the window is
       not in a bracket. For example, in `C', a comment starts with cGcG/*cAcA and
       ends with cGcG*/cAcA so if the hilight was initialized with

sB
              0 hilight 1 2 10 $global-scheme

sA
       of the following, only the first would begin hi-lighted which is
       correct (assuming the cGcG/*cAcA is 10 or less lines away).

               /* ........         /*.........           .........
                  ........           .........*/         .........
              ----------------    ---------------     --------------- top of
                  ........*/         .........           .........    window


    The optional argument "cCbuffer-schemecA" specifies the default scheme to use
    if there is no specific hi-light, when omitted the value of
    ls$global-scheme(5)lm$global-scheme(5)le is used. The buffer-scheme is a reference to a set of
    foreground and background color pairs previously defined with
    lsadd-color-scheme(2)lmadd-color-scheme(2)le. The last argument "trunc-scheme" is also optional and
    specifies the line truncation scheme, when omitted the value of
    ls$trunc-scheme(5)lm$trunc-scheme(5)le is used.

    The hi-lighting scheme required is based on the type of file being edited
    and so is usually directly related to the file extension, thus it can be
    automatically set using file hooks (see lsadd-file-hook(2)lmadd-file-hook(2)le).


cEHilight Scheme Token Creation  cA


    cDhilightcA "cChil-nocA" "cCtypecA" "cCtokencA" [ ["cCrtokencA"]
         [ ( [ "close" ["rclose"] "ignore" ] ) |
              ( ["continue" ["rcontinue"] ] ) |
              ( ["b-hil-no"] ) ]
       "cCschemeNumcA"  
    cDhilightcA "cChil-nocA" "cC0x200cA" "cCtokencA"  
    cDhilightcA "cChil-nocA" "cC0x400cA" "cCfrom-colcA" "cCto-colcA" "cCschemeNumcA"  

    With the default argument of cG1cA, cDhilightcA creates a hilight token to be used
    in hilight color scheme identified by "cChil-nocA" (1-255) (see the section on
    cDHilight Scheme CreationcA for a overview of hi-lighting). The second
    argument "cCtypecA" specifies the token type and must always be specified, it
    determines which other arguments required.

    Typically the last argument, cCschemeNumcA, is also required. This identifies
    the color scheme to use when hilighting the token, defining the
    foreground, background and selection color schemes. This is an index
    generated from lsadd-color-scheme(2)lmadd-color-scheme(2)le. If the cCschemeNumcA argument is omitted
    the default hilght color scheme is used.

    The token "cDtypecA" is a bit based flag of which 0, 1 or more of the bits may
    be set, the effect of the bits are defined as follows:

    cD0x001cA

       The "cCtokencA" must be surrounded by non-word characters (word characters
       are typically the alpha-numeric characters), e.g. the following
       defines cGcGifcAcA as a token:

sB
              hilight 1 1 "if" .scheme.keyword

sA
       this hilights the 'if' in cG` if `cA but not in cGcGaifacAcA.

    cD0x002cA

       Color this to the end of the line, often used for comments etc. For
       example in MicroEmacs macro language a cCcG;cAcA character signifies the
       rest of the line as a comment, hilighting is defined as follows:

sB
              ; this is a comment line
              hilight 1 2 ";" .scheme.comment

sA
    cD0x004cA

       This is a bracket token, the closing bracket string "cCclosecA" and an
       ignore character "cCignorecA" must also be supplied. The ignore character
       indicates that when found it should ignore the next character; this
       prevents an early end on bracket miss-match. For example, in C a cCcG"cAcA
       character can be inserted into a string by 'protecting' it with a cCcG\cAcA
       character, such as "cCthis is a string with a \" in itcA". In this example
       the ignore character should be 'cC\cA' so the mid string cCcG"cAcA is correctly
       ignored, as follows:

sB
              hilight 1 4 "\"" "\"" "\\" .scheme.string

sA
       An empty value, "", effectively disables the ignore feature. If
       replacing bit cG0x040cA is set the replacement close bracket "cCrclosecA" must
       be supplied.

    cD0x008cA

       The token has a continuation string, usually used with 0x02 but cannot
       be used with token types cG0x004cA and cG0x080cA. The argument "cCcontinuecA" must
       be supplied and if the replacing bit cG0x040cA is set the replacement
       continue string "cCrcontinuecA" must also be supplied. The best example of
       its use can again be found in C; macros defined using the cG#definecA
       pre-processor construct may be constructed on single or multiple
       lines. The macro continues onto another line if the current line ends
       with a backslash cCcG\cAcA character, e.g.:

              #define a_single_line_macro() printf("hello world\n")

              #define a_four_lined_macro()          \
              do {                                  \
                  printf("hello world\n") ;         \
              } while(0)


        This can be correctly hilighted with the pre-processor scheme using:

sB
              ; use to-end-of-line (2) and continuation (8), i.e. 2+8=10
              hilight 1 10 "#" "\\" .scheme.prepro

sA
    cD0x010cA


       If this is an end of line token (`0x002`) then  
              The rest of the line is checked for any valid brackets.

       Else if this is a bracket token (`0x004`) then
              This is still searched for after an end of line token is found.

       Else
              Ignored

       This feature enables the searching and hilighting of specific brackets
       contained within a to-end-of-line scheme. For example, consider the
       following C code:

              #define My_Token 0x01  /* This is a multi-lined comment
                                      * describing My_Token */


       With the cCcG#cAcA pre-processor hilight (see bit 0x08 above) the #define
       line would all be hilighted with the pre-process scheme, the comment
       would be missed causing incorrect hilighting of the next line. Instead
       this feature may be used by both the pre-processor and comment hilight
       tokens to correctly hilight the above example:

sB
              hilight 1 26 "#" "\\" .scheme.prepro
              hilight 1 20 "/\\*" "*/" "" .scheme.comment

sA
    cD0x020cA

       This token must be the first non-white character of the line.

    cD0x040cA

       The token (and closing bracket tokens) are to be replaced by the given
       replacement strings. This is often utilized when displaying formated
       text such as MicroEmacs on-line help lsehf(8)lmehf(8)le pages, the output from
       UNIX cDman(1)cA etc. In MicroEmacs help pages, the start of bold text is
       delimited with the character sequence cGcG\C[cDcAcA and ends with the
       character sequence cGcG\CcAcA, e.g.

              "the word \C[cDbold\C[cA is in \C[cDbold\C[cA"


       Obviously the hilight delimiters should not appear so the character
       sequence may be correctly drawn using a bracket token, starting with
       cGcG\CcDcAcA and ending with cGcG\CcAcAcA, replacing both with an empty string:

sB
              hilight 1 0x44 "\C[cD" "" "\C[cA" "" "" .scheme.bold


sA    cD0x080cA

       This is a branch token. When this token is found, the token (or the
       replace string) is colored using the given color cCschemeNumcA and then
       the current hilighting scheme is changed to "cCb-hil-nocA" (which MUST be
       defined by the time it is first used). The "cCb-hil-nocA" hi-light scheme
       should also contain a branch token which branches back to "cChil-nocA" or
       cGcG0cAcA (which branches to ls$buffer-hilight(5)lm$buffer-hilight(5)le). A branch does not have to
       branch back to "cChil-nocA", it may branch to any other hi-light scheme.
       The branches are not stacked and there is no limit on the nesting.

    cD0x100cA

       The token must be at the start of the line.

    cD0x200cA

       This is an invalid token in its own right, which is used for
       optimizing a hi-lighting scheme.

       This has the second highest precedence (see cD0x400cA) and all other bits
       are ignored. Only the first 3 arguments are required. For example, if
       there are 11 tokens starting with cGcGdelete-cAcA as with the hi-lighting of
       this buffer, then adding the token cGcGdelete-cAcA, while invalid in its own
       right, means that cGcGdelete-cAcA is only checked for once. This also
       reduces the size of the internal hilighting tables so if the message
       "cDTable fullcA" appears, the hilighting scheme should be reduced by
       removal of the common components.

    cD0x400cA

       This is a column hilighting token, which allows absolute columns
       within a window to be hilighted (irrespective of the contents). This
       bit takes precedence over all other bits and all other bits are
       ignored. Column highlighting is a different concept to token in that
       it requires a "cCfrom-colcA" and a "cCto-colcA" column positions and a line
       will be hilighted in the given scheme between these two columns.

    cD0x800cA

       The flag is used with bracket tokens (cG0x04cA) and indicates that the
       bracket is typically contained on a single line. This information is
       used by MicroEmacs in trying to avoid hilighting anomalies caused when
       the start and end tokens of the bracket are the same (e.g. a string's
       start and end token is cCcG"cAcA). Problems arise when the bracket starts on
       one line and closes on a later line, even with a large look-back,
       eventually the start bracket will become too far back and only the end
       bracket is found. But as this is the same as the open token it is
       mistaken for an open bracket and the strings become out of synch. This
       test can reset this if further down the file an open and close bracket
       is found on the same line. For this to have any effect, the hilighting
       scheme must use look-back (flag cG0x02cA of cDHilight CreationcA).

    cD0x1000cA

       Flag is typically used with a branch token (cG0x04cA) and indicates that
       the hilight exists to the end of the line or is terminated by the new
       line (i.e. encountering the end of line will removes the branch
       hilight).

    Note that cG0x004cA, cG0x008cA and cG0x080cA are mutually exclusive and more than 1
    should not be set in any one hilight token, if 2 or more are set the
    effect is undefined. Other than this there is no restrictions placed on
    the types of token used, although strange combinations like cG0x006cA may lead
    to unexpected results -- hopefully not a core dump, but not guaranteed !

    The token and close token of brackets may contain a limited subset of
    regular expression tokens as follows:-

    cD^cA

       When specified as the first character of the token, the token must be
       at the start of the line.

    cD$cA

       The token must be at the end of the line, must be the last character.

    cD\{cA

       Indicates the start of the hilighted part of the token, only one may
       be used per token. This token use is different from regex. The cD\{cA
       hilight start marker must be at a fixed point from the start of the
       token, that is a wild card sequence may NOT proceed the cGcG\{cAcA token,
       i.e. cG`A\{ *B`cA is correct, cG`A *\{B`cA is incorrect as it is proceeded by
       a wild card character.

    cD\}cA

       Indicates the end of the hilighted part of the token, only one may be
       used per token. The rest of the token must be matched for it to be
       used but is not considered part of the token, i.e. hilighting
       continues on the character immediately after the "cC\}cA", not at the end
       of the token. Similar to the cD\<cA token, the length of the rest of the
       token must be fixed. This token use is different from regex.

    cD\(.\)cA

       Groups are supported in hilighting, but they must only enclose a
       single character, closures ('*', '?' and '+') must come after the
       closure, i.e. use "\(.\)*", not "\(.*\)". Alternatives (cGcG\|cAcA) are not
       supported.

       Groups are used to capture a single, this single character may be
       tested again within the string using the syntax cG\1cA..cG\9cA as with regular
       expressions. Where the inverse character is required then the syntax
       cG\!1cA..cG\!9cA may be used. This NOT syntax is special to highlighting and
       is not present in the regular expression general syntax.

    cD.cA

       Matches any character.

    cD[...]cA

       Matches a single buffer character to a range of characters, for
       example to hilight MicroEmacs register variables (i.e. cG#g0cA-cG#g9cA,
       cG#p0cA-cG#p9cA, cG#l0cA-cG#l9cA) the following regex string may be used:

sB
              hilight 1 1 "#[gpl][0-9]"

sA 
       This matches a token which starts with a cCcG#cAcA, followed by a cCcGgcAcA, cCcGpcAcA
       or cCcGlcAcA character and ends with a numerical digit. If the user required
       the replacement (bit 0x40) of the cGcG#cAcA to "#register" to aid
       readability, the replacement string some now needs to know whether the
       second character was a cCcGgcAcA, cCcGpcAcA or cCcGlcAcA and which digit. Up to 9 groups
       (cGcG\(.\)cAcA) can be use to store a store a single search character, which
       can be used later in the search string and in the replacement string
       by using the form "\`#`", where cG#cA is the range test number counting from
       the left, e.g. for the given example use:

sB
              hilight 1 65 "#\\([gpl]\\)\\([0-9]\\)" "#register\\1\\2"

sA
       The content of the brackets (cD[cA...cD]cA) include a set of special short
       cuts and regular expression syntax definitions as follows:-

       cG[abc]cA
    
             A list of characters.

       cG[a-z]cA
     
            A range of characters.

       cG[-.0-9]cA
     
            A combination of character lists and ranges.

       cG[[:space:]]cA

            A white space character. See lsset-char-mask(2)lmset-char-mask(2)le for a full
             description on MicroEmacs character range support.

       cG[[:digit:]]cA
     
            A digit, 0-9.

       cG[[:xdigit:]]cA
     
             A hexadecimal digit, 0-9, a-f, A-F.

       cG[[:lower:]]cA
    
            A lower case letter, by default a-z.

       cG[[:upper:]]cA
     
            An upper case letter, by default A-Z.

       cG[[:alpha:]]cA
     
            A lower or upper case letter.

       cG[[:alnum:]]cA
     
            A lower or upper case letter or a digit.

       cG[[:sword:]]cA
      
           A spell word character.

       cD[^...]cA
     
           Matches all characters except the given range of characters, e.g.
           "[^[:space:]]".

    cG\#cA
 
       The same character which matched the #th group token. This
       functionality is best explained using UNIX cDman(1)cA output as an
       example, to create a bold character 'cCcCXcAcA' it produces cGcGX\CHXcAcA where cG\CHcA
       is a backspace character thereby overstriking the first cCcGXcAcA with
       another creating a bold character. This can be checked for and
       simulated in MicroEmacs using the following:

sB
              hilight 1 64 "\\(.\\)\CH\\1" "\\1" .scheme.bold

sA
       The use of cGcG\1cAcA in the search string ensures that the second character
       is the same as the first. This is replace by a single character drawn
       in the bold scheme.

    cG\!#cA
 
       The inverse character that matched the #th group token, i.e. NOT cG\1cA.

    cD?cA cD+cA cD*cA
 
       Matches 0 or 1, 1 or more and 0 or more of the previous character or
       character range respectively.

    `\a \A \w \W \l \L \m \u \U \d \D \h \H \x \s \S \e \g \n \r`
    
       Marches (cGacA)lphabetic lower, the special word characters (cGwcA)ord,
       (cGlcA)ower, (cGmcA)alhpanumeric, (cGucA)pper, (cGdcA)igit, (cGhcA)exdigit (cGxcAxx) literal
       hexdecimal digit, white(cGscA)pace, (cGecAescape, (cGncA)ewline, (cGgcA}bell,
       (cGrcA)formfeed. The uppercase letters are the inverse. 
       (see ([Regular Expressions]RegularExpressions(2))).

    Following is a list of hilighting regular expression restrictions:

       The number of characters to the left of a cD{cA and to the right of a cD}cA
       token must be fixed, i.e. the 'cD?cD', 'cA+cD' and 'cA*cA' tokens cannot be used
       before this token. Consider the hilighting of a C function name
       defined to be a token at the start of a line followed by 0 or more
       spaces followed by a '('. The following hilight token looks valid but
       the variable space match is incorrect as it is to the right of the cD}cA:

sB
              hilight 1 0 "^\\w+\\}\\s*(" .scheme.function

sA
       Instead either the space match must be include in the function token
       hilighting (which may cause problems, particularly if printing with
       underlining) or by fixing the number of spaces as follows:

sB
              ; include the spaces in the function hilighting
              hilight 1 0 "^\\w+\\s*\\}(" .scheme.function
              ; or fix the number of spaces to 0, 1 ...
              hilight .hilight.c    0 "^\\w+\\}(" .scheme.function
              hilight .hilight.c    0 "^\\w+\}\\s(" .scheme.function

sA
       The cD+cA and cD*cA tokens match the longest string and do not narrow, e.g.
       consider the hilighting of a C goto label which takes the form of an
       alpha-numerical name at the start of a line followed by a ':'
       character. The token cGcG^.*:cAcA cannot be used as cG.cA will also match and
       move past the ending ':', ending only at the end of the line. As no
       narrowing is performed the final cCcG:cAcA in the token will not match and
       the label will not be hilighted. Instead a character range which
       excludes a ':' character must be used, e.g. "cD^[^:]*:cA".

       A group should not be followed by a cD?cA or cD*cA closure, it should either
       be a fixed single character or followed by a cD+cA closure (in which case
       the last matching character is stored).


    Following is a list of hilight type bit / token regex equivalents:

    cD0x01cA

       cGcG[^word]\{????\}[^word]cAcA

    cD0x02cA

       cGcG????.*cAcA

    cD0x20cA

       cGcG^\s*\{????cAcA - (note that this is strictly incorrect as the cG\s*cA is to
       the left of the cG\{cA, it is correctly handled for the ease of use).

    cD0x100cA

       cGcG^????cAcA


cEHilight Scheme Token Deletion  cA


    cC-1cA cDhilightcA "cChil-nocA" "cCtypecA" "cCtokencA" With a negative argument cDhilightcA
    deletes the given "cCtokencA" from a hi-light color scheme identified by
    "cChil-nocA". The token "cCtypecA" must also be specified to distinguish between
    normal and column token types.


cEEXAMPLE cA


cEExample 1  cA

cEExample 3  cA


    The following example uses the branch hilighting feature to hilight each
    window line a different color to its neighbors by cycle through 3
    different color schemes:

sB
          0 hilight .hilight.line1 0                        $global-scheme
            hilight .hilight.line1 0x80 "\\n" .hilight.line2 .scheme.no1

cEExample 4  cA


    Simulate the hilighting from the output of a UNIX man page (taken from
    hkman.emf):

sB

          ; normal underline/italic
          hilight .hilight.man 64 "_\CH\\(.\\)\\}[^\CH]" "\\1"     .scheme.italic
          hilight .hilight.man 64 "\\(.\\)\CH_\\}[^\CH]" "\\1"     .scheme.italic
          ; bold - first is for nroff -man
          hilight .hilight.man 64 "\\(.\\)\CH\\1\\}[^\CH]" "\\1"   .scheme.bold
          hilight .hilight.man 64 "_\CH_\CH_\CH_\\}[^\CH]" "_"     .scheme.header
          hilight .hilight.man 64 "\\(.\\)\CH\\1\CH\\1\CH\\1\\}[^\CH]" "\\1" .scheme.header
          ; bold underline
          hilight .hilight.man 64 "_\CH_\CH_\CH_\CH_\\}[^\CH]" "_" .scheme.italic
          hilight .hilight.man 64 "_\CH\\(.\\)\CH\\1\CH\\1\CH\\1\\}[^\CH]" "\\1" .scheme.italic

sA
    This replaces the complex nroff character string with a single hi-lighted
    character (if you do not believe me then try it!).


cENOTES cA


    MicroEmacs hilight was written with speed and flexibility in mind, as a
    result the user is assumed to know what they are doing, if not the effects
    can sometimes be fatal.

    Within MicroEmacs macro language then a single backslash cGcG\cAcA is the escape
    character of the macro pre-processor. When writing a regular expression
    search string in the macro language then search string backslashes should
    be escaped. Hence a regular expression defined as cGcG\x41\\x41cAcA searches for
    the character cCcGAcAcA (cCcGAcAcA is hexadecimal 0x41 i.e. cGcG\x41cAcA) followed by a
    single hexadecimal character (cGcG\\xcAcA) followed by the literal string cGcG41cAcA.


cEHISTORY cA


    The March 2005 release modified the NOT replacement pattern with cGcG\s!DcAcA
    where cGDcA is the numeric group identifier cG1..9cA.

    The token cG0x1000cA was undocumented before March 2005 and is now a fully
    supported hilight mode.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDinsert-macrocA inserts the named cCcommandcA into the current buffer in the
    MicroEmacs 2009 macro language, thus enables it to be saved, re-load and
    therefore re-used at a later date. This is often used in conjunction with

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDinsert-stringcA "cCstringcA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDinsert-stringcA inserts a string cCncA times into the current buffer, moving the
    cursor position.

    cDinsert-stringcA allows text to be built in a buffer without reading it from
    a file. Some special escape characters are interpreted in the cCstringcA, as
    follows:

       `\n` - Enters a new line
       `\t` - A tab character
       `\b` - Backspace
       `\f` - Form-feed
       `\\` - Literal backslash character '`\`'
       `\xXX` - Hexadecimal value of character ASCII value


cENOTES cA


    If a negative argument cCncA is given to cDinsert-stringcA the given string is
    inserted 0-cCncA times into the buffer. The behavior is the same as if a
    positive argument is given except that if the string contains a new-line
    character (ascii char 0x0a), rather than splitting the string over
    multiple lines the character is inserted into a single line of the buffer.

    This is highly irregular and can break MicroEmacs (for example lsundo(2)lmundo(2)le
    will fail and could lead to a crash); the feature has been added to
    support bit cG0x100cA of the lsshell-command(2)lmshell-command(2)le process spawning group of
    commands. It's use outside of this context is to be avoided.

    UNIX - cCirixcA, cChpuxcA, cCsunoscA, cCfreebsdcA, cClinuxcA.

    Windows NT - cCwin32cA.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDipipe-shell-commandcA executes the given system command cCcommandcA, opening up
    a cD*icommand*cA buffer into which the results of the command execution are
    displayed. Unlike the lspipe-shell-command(2)lmpipe-shell-command(2)le, the user may continue editing
    during command execution. The command may be terminated by deleting the
    buffer or issuing a cDipipe-killcA command.

    The argument cCncA can be used to change the default behavior of
    pipe-shell-command described above, cCncA is a bit based flag where:-

    cD0x01cA

       Enables the use of the default buffer name cD*icommand*cA (default). If
       this bit is clear the user must supply a buffer name cCbuffer-namecA. The
       buffer naming allows another command to be started without effecting
       any other existing command buffer.

    cD0x02cA

       Hides the output buffer, the default action pops up a window and
       displays the output buffer in a new window.

    cD0x04cA

       Disable the use of the command-line processor to launch the program
       (MS Win32 versions only). By default the "cCcommandcA" is launched by
       executing the command:

              %COMSPEC% /c command


       Where cG%COMSPEC%cA is typically cGcommand.comcA. If this bit is set "cCcommandcA"
       is launched directly.

    cD0x08cA

       Detach the launched process from MicroEmacs (MS Win32 versions only).
       By default the command is launched as a child process of MicroEmacs
       with a new console. With this bit set the process is completely
       detached from MicroEmacs instead.

    cD0x10cA

       Disable the command name mangling (MS Win32 versions only). By default
       any cCcG/cAcA characters found in the command name (the first argument only)
       are converted to cCcG\cAcA characters to make it Windows compliant.

    cD0x20cA

       Displays the new process window (win32 versions only), by default the
       window is hidden.

    cD0x40cA

       Raw ipipe, disable text annotation at the start and end of the pipe
       output and force lswrap(2m)lmwrap(2m)le mode off.

    cD0x80cA
    
       Supply a function cCbuffer-ipipe-commandcA to be invoked when the pipe
       receives data and terminates. This is equivalent to setting the buffer
       variable ls$buffer-ipipe(5)lm$buffer-ipipe(5)le but allows the pipe to be set when the ipipe
       is created. Setting the cC$buffer-ipipecA on invocation allows the pipe
       exit status to be trapped properly.

    cD0x100cA

       When set the command-line to be run is the first line of buffer
       cCstringcA, this feature can be used to overcome the default 1024
       character command-line limit. When a multiple-line command-line is
       required, a negative argument can be given to lsinsert-string(2)lminsert-string(2)le.

    cD0x200cA

       When set prevents the lines from wrapping.

    Many other macro commands (see lscompile(3)lmcompile(3)le, lsgrep(3)lmgrep(3)le, etc.) use this
    command.

    cDipipe-writecA writes a string cCstringcA to an open ipipe, cCncA times.

    cDipipe-killcA terminates an open ipipe and is automatically invoked when the
    ipipe buffer is deleted using lsdelete-buffer(2)lmdelete-buffer(2)le or when MicroEmacs is
    exited. The numeric argument cCncA may be used to change the signal generated,
    where cCncA takes the following values:

    cD1cA

       Sends a Terminate process signal, literally a cGSIGKILLcA signal on UNIX
       or a cGWM_CLOSEcA on Windows. This is the default signal and is typically
       bound to `C-c C-k`.

    cD2cA

       Sends an interrupt signal, writes a cCCtrl-CcA to the cC<stdin>cA pipe on UNIX
       or sends cCCtrl-CcA key events on Windows. This is typically bound to C-c
       C-c.


cENOTES cA


    On UNIX platforms the TERM environment variable of the new process may be
    set by setting the user variable cD%ipipe-termcA to the required value, e.g.:

              set-variable %ipipe-term "TERM=vt100-nam"


    Ipipe shells support a large sub-set of vt100 terminal commands, notable
    exceptions are color, font support and auto-margins. Using the terminal
    type cGcGvt100-namcAcA disables the use of auto-margins, thereby providing
    better support.

    On platforms which do not support cDipipe-shell-commandcA, such as MS-DOS,
    executing cDipipe-shell-commandcA automatically invokes lspipe-shell-command(2)lmpipe-shell-commandle.
    Therefore macros may safely use ipipes without explicitly checking the
    platform type. cDipipe-shell-commandcA does not run reliably on cDWindowscA cD3.11cA
    and cDWindowscA cD95cA; cDWindowscA cDNTcA does support ipipes.

    While the pipe command is running, mode lspipe(2m)lmpipe(2m)le is enabled. Modes
    lslock(2m)lmlock(2m)le and lswrap(2m)lmwrap(2m)le effect the output behavior of an
    cDipipe-shell-commandcA.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example is the lsxgrep(3)lmxgrep(3)le command macro which utilizes the
    cDipipe-shell-commandcA, diverting the output to a buffer called cD*grep*cA.

sB
          define-macro xgrep
              !force set-variable #l0 @1
              !if &not $status
                  set-variable #l0 @ml00 %xgrep-com
              !endif
              !if @?
                  1 pipe-shell-command &cat %xgrep-com #l0 "*grep*" @mna
              !else
                  1 ipipe-shell-command &cat %xgrep-com #l0 "*grep*" @mna
              !endif
          !emacro

sA
    Note that if an argument is passed to cDgrepcA then it uses pipe-shell-command
    instead. This is useful if another command is using cDgrepcA which must finish
    before the calling command can continue, see lsreplace-all-string(3)lmreplace-all-string(3)le for an
    example.


cEBUGS cA


    On MicroSoft Windows platforms, cDipipe-shell-commandcA spawns the shell (e.g.
    cGcommand.comcA) with the appropriate command line to make it execute the
    given command. If the command to be run detaches from the shell and
    creates its own window, for example cGme.execA, cDipipe-killcA will only kill the
    shell, it will not kill the actual process, i.e. the cGme.execA.

    On MicroSoft Windows platforms cDipipe-shell-commandcA does not work on
    Novell's Intranet Client v2.2 networked drives, version 2.5 does appear to
    work.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDisearch-forwardcA [ "cCargcA" ] (cDC-scA)  
    cCncA cDisearch-backwardcA [ "cCargcA" ] (cDC-rcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDisearch-forwardcA provides an interactive search in the forward direction.
    This command is similar to lssearch-forward(2)lmsearch-forward(2)le, but it processes the search
    as each character of the input string is typed in. This allows the user to
    only use as many key-strokes as are needed to uniquely specify the string
    being searched. The string argument cCargcA is not supplied when invoked
    interactively.

    The follow keys can be used at the start of an incremental search only:

       `C-s` - Search for last string.
       `C-m` - Perform a search-forward instead.
       `esc p`,
       `esc n` - Scroll through history list etc (See [ml-bind-key(2)](ml-bind-key(2))).

    Several control characters are active while isearching:

    cDC-scA or cDC-x cA

       Skip to the next occurrence of the current string

    cDC-rcA

       Skip to the last occurrence of the current string

    cDC-hcA

       Back up to the last match (possibly deleting the last character on the
       search string)

    cDC-wcA

       Insert the next word into the search string.

    cDC-gcA

       Abort the search, return to start.

    cDesc cAor cDC-mcA

       End the search, stay here

    cDisearch-backwardcA is the same as cDisearch-forwardcA, but it searches in the
    reverse direction.

    For both commands when the end of the buffer is reached, an alarm is
    raised (bell etc.) a further search request (cGC-scA) causes the search to
    commence from the start of the buffer.

    The numeric argument cCncA controls the behavior of cDisearch-*cA at the end of
    the buffer. When specified as cG0cA then the search exits when the start/end
    of the buffer is reached and the search is exhausted. When omitted (or
    specified as cG1cA) then the search recommences again at the start/end of the
    buffer, this is the default behavior.

    When cDisearch-*cA is invoked from a macro then the string argument cCargcA
    specifies the search string. cDisearchcA is primarily designed for for
    interactive use and is not typically used from within a macro. When
    embedded in a macro then it is typically invoked with the cG0cA argument so
    that the calling macro may handle the start/end of buffer condition. The
    macro lspage-file(3)lmpage-file(3)le uses cDisearch-*cA and performs exactly this operation, for
    a comprehensive example refer to macro file cGpagefile.emfcA.


cENOTES cA


    The lsml-bind-key(2)lmml-bind-key(2)le bindings are used.

    The incremental search supports buffer modes lsexact(2m)lmexact(2m)le and lsmagic(2m)lmmagic(2m)le.


cEHISTORY cA


    The numeric argument to cDisearch-*cA was first introduced into MicroEmacs '04.


cEBUGS cA


    Due to the dynamic nature of active lsipipe-shell-command(2)lmipipe-shell-command(2)le buffers the
    search history cannot be stored in the same way (list of fixed locations).
    As a result the search history is stored as a list of searches which are
    not guaranteed to be consistent.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDkill-paragraphcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDkill-paragraphcA deletes the next cCncA paragraphs from the current cursor
    position, the paragraphs that are killed are added to the kill buffer. If
    the cursor is in the middle of a paragraph then the text from the current
    cursor position to the end (or start, depending on direction) of the
    paragraph is deleted.

    If cCncA is positive then the kill direction is forwards, if cCncA is negative
    then the kill direction is backwards. If cCncA is cG0cA (zero) the command simply
    returns. The default value for cCncA is cG+1cA.


cEDIAGNOSTICS cA


    The following errors can be generated, in each case the command returns a
    FALSE status:

    cD[end of buffer]cA

       The positive argument cCncA is greater than the number of remaining
       paragraphs, all of the remaining paragraphs to the end of the buffer
       are still removed.

    cD[top of buffer]cA

       The negative argument cCncA is greater than the number of previous
       paragraphs, all of the previous paragraphs to the top of the buffer
       are still removed.


cENOTES cA


    A paragraph is terminated by a blank line. All text residing between two
    blank lines is considered to be a paragraph - regardless of the text
    layout.


cEHISTORY cA


    The behavior of cDkill-paragraphcA was modified in November 2004 after which
    the numeric argument cCncA was interpreted to control the number and direction
    of paragraphs to delete. Previous releases interpreted a negative value as
    a control to disable the deleted text from entering the kill buffer. If
    the existing behavior is required then lskill-region(2)lmkill-region(2)le with a negative
    argument should be used to delete a region of marked text,
    lsforward-paragraph(2)lmforward-paragraph(2)le and lsbackward-paragraph(2)lmbackward-paragraph(2)le may be used to move to the
    appropriate kill position.

$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDkill-regioncA (cDC-wcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDkill-regioncA deletes all characters from the cursor to the mark set with
    the lsset-mark(2)lmset-mark(2)le command. The characters removed are copied into the kill
    buffer and may be extracted using lsyank(2)lmyank(2)le. If a numeric argument of cG0cA is
    given the command has no effect. If a negative argument is given the
    characters are not placed in the kill buffer, therefore the text is
    effectively lost (this does not effect the lsundo(2)lmundo(2)le operation).

    The mark position may be ahead or behind the current cursor position.

    Where the region contains a narrowed region, defined by lsnarrow-buffer(2)lmnarrow-buffer(2)le,
    then cDkill-regioncA deletes all text contained within the narrow, this text
    is added to the kill buffer.


cEUSAGE cA


    To move text from one place to another:

    - Move to the beginning of the text you want to move.
    - Set the mark there with the lsset-mark(2)lmset-markle (cDesc spacecA) command.
    - Move the point (cursor) to the end of the text.
    - Use the cDkill-regioncA command to delete the region you just defined.
          The text will be saved in the kill buffer.
    - Move the point to the place you want the text to appear.
    - Use the lsyank(2)lmyankle (cDC-ycA) command to copy the text from the kill buffer to
          the current point.

    Repeat the last two steps to insert further copies of the same text.


cENOTES cA


    If a region is accidentally removed then lsyank(2)lmyankle the text back immediately or
    use lsundo(2)lmundo(2)le.

    Windowing systems such as X-Windows and Microsoft Windows utilize a global
    windowing kill buffer allowing data to be moved between windowing
    applications (cCcut buffercA and cCclipboardcA, respectively). Within these
    environments MicroEmacs 2009 automatically interacts with the windowing
    systems kill buffer, the last MicroEmacs 2009 cDkill-regioncA entry is
    immediately available for a paste operation into another windowing
    application.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDkill-linecA (cDC-kcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDkill-linecA, when used with no argument cCncA, deletes all text from the cursor
    to the end of a line, the end of line character is NOT deleted. The
    deleted text is placed in the kill buffer, see lsyank(2)lmyank(2)le for more
    information on the kill buffer. If the line is blank then the whole line
    is deleted, including the end of line character.

    If a positive argument cCncA is supplied the specified number of lines are
    deleted. If a negative argument is specified the previous -cCncA lines are
    deleted. If cCncA is cG0cA the command has no effect.


cENOTES cA


    If a line is accidentally removed then use lsyank(2)lmyankle to restore the text or use
    lsundo(2)lmundo(2)le.

    The Emacs Key binding for kill line ((cDC-kcA) ) may be re-bound to affect the

sA
cEHISTORY cA


    The behavior of cDkill-linecA was modified in November 2004. cDkill-linecA now
    interprets the numeric argument cCncA in both a positive and negative
    direction. The existing implementation did not operated in a negative
    direction, the negative argument controlled the kill buffer behavior of
    the line. The kill behavior is no longer an option to cDkill-linecA and the
    line(s) are always added to the kill buffer, control of the kill buffer is
    required then deletion should be performed with lskill-region(2)lmkill-region(2)le.

    The behavior of the end of line kill used to be controlled by a cDline(2m)cA
    mode, this behavior may be replicated by modification of the binding as
    described in the previous section.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDlist-bufferscA (cDC-x C-bcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDlist-bufferscA splits the current window and in one half brings up a list of
    all the buffers currently existing in the editor. The active modes, change
    flag, and active flag for each buffer is displayed. (The change flag is a
    cD*cA character if the buffer has been changed and not written out. The active
    flag is not an cD@cA if the file had been specified on the command line, but
    has not been read in yet since nothing has switched to that buffer.)

    The numerical argument cCncA is a bitwise flag which determines the
    information that is displayed by the command, it is interpreted follows:-

    cG  1cA - The default, when the bit is set displays visible buffers only. When
    clear displays both visible and lshide(2m)lmhiddenle buffers.
    
    cG  2cA - When set shows buffer size information, including file size, memory
    size and undo size in bytes.

    The buffer list has some special command keys associated with it which
    allow the state of the buffers to be edited from the buffer list, the
    editing allows buffers to be killed and saved to disk. The key codes are
    defined as follows:-

    cD1cA - Switch to buffer

       Switch to that buffer and make it the only buffer.

    cD2cA - Move to buffer

       Switch the buffer list window to that buffer.

    cDDcA - delete buffer

       Flag buffer for deletion. A buffer scheduled for deletion is marked
       with a 'cDDcD' in first column. The delete status is enacted by the 'cAXcA'
       command, or may be removed with the 'cCcCUcAcA' command.

    cDScA - save buffer

       Flag buffer for saving. A buffer scheduled from saving is marked with
       a 'cCcCScAcA' in the second column. Note that a buffer may be marked for
       saving and deletion, the save operation is performed before the
       delete.

    cDUcA - unmark buffer

       Unmark the 'cDDcD' and 'cAScA' flags on current line.

    cDXcA - execute

       Execute all the 'cDDcD' and 'cAScD' flags currently set. The cAScAave is enacted
       first.

    For all but 'cCcCXcAcA', the buffer selected is the buffer noted on the current
    cursor line. These keys are not remappable.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDbuffer-bind-keycA creates a key binding local to the current buffer, binding
    the command cCcommandcA to the keyboard input cCkeycA. This command is
    particularly useful in conjunction with file loading hooks (see

    of the buffer.

    The message line input is not effected by the current buffers local
    bindings.

    cDbuffer-unbind-keycA unbinds a user created local key binding, this command
    effects only the current buffer. If a negative argument is given to
    cDbuffer-unbind-keycA then all the current buffer's bindings are removed.

cEHistory  cA


    MicroEmacs 2009 stores the last 20 entries of each kind (command, buffer,
    file, search and general which is also saved in the history file so the
    state of the history is retained when next loaded. The following commands
    can be used to manipulate the history.

    - next history list entry (loop through history), command:
    - lsforward-paragraph(2)lmforward-paragraphle (esc n, C-n, down)
    - previous history list entry, command: lsforward-paragraph(2)lmbackward-paragraphle (cDesc pcA, C-p, up)


cECompletion  cA


    When entering a command, file, buffer or a mode name MicroEmacs 2009
    creates a list of possible completions the following operations can be

$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDchange-buffer-namecA "cCbuffer-namecA" (cDesc C-ncA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDchange-buffer-namecA changes the name of the current buffer to cCbuffer-namecA.
    Buffer names must be unique as they act as the identity handle. By default
    the buffer name is derived from the buffer's file name excluding the path.
    This can lead to conflicts, when editing files with the same name and
    different paths, in which case a counter is appended to the end of the
    buffer name to make the name unique. For example:

       File Name               Buffer Name

       /etc/file.c             file.c
       /tmp/file.c             file.c<1>


    The numeric argument cCncA is a bit-mask and is interpreted as follows:

 cG0x01cA
 
       By default, or an argument is specified with bit 1 set,
       cDchange-buffer-namecA fails if a buffer with the given name already
       exists. This behavior can be changed by specifying an argument with
       the first bit cleared, e.g. 0, in which case if a buffer with that
       name already exists then a counter as appended.

    cG0x02cA
    
       Forces the buffer to adopt the given name cCbuffer-namecA, changing the
       name of any existing buffer if required.

    cCncA cDfind-buffercA "cCbuffer-namecA" (cDC-x bcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDnext-buffercA switches to the cCncAth next buffer in the buffer list in the
    current window, the default cCncA is cG1cA, if cCncA is negative then the cG0-cAcCncAth
    previous buffer is selected. If cG0cA or a number greater than the number of
    buffers is specified then the command fails.

    cDfind-buffercA switches to buffer "cCbuffer-namecA" in the current window. If the
    buffer does not exist and a zero argument cCncA is supplied then the command
    fails. If the buffer does not exist but no argument or a positive argument
    cCncA is specified then a new buffer is created, at which point the file-hook
    is evaluated.

    If a negative argument cCncA is given to cDfind-buffercA then the buffer will be
    hidden. Any window displaying "cCbuffer-namecA" will find another buffer to
    display. This functionality is often used with the lshide(2m)lmhide(2m)le buffer mode.
    If a value of -1 is given then the buffer will not be hidden in a window
    whose ls$window-flags(5)lm$window-flags(5)le are set to lock the buffer to the window. If a
    value of less than -1 is given then the buffer is hidden from all windows.

    The numeric argument of cDfind-buffercA is treated as a bit mask as follows:

    cG0x01cA

       Bit set then the buffer is created if it does not exist. Bit clear
       then the command fails if the buffer does not exist.

    cG0x02cA

       Locate the buffer whose buffer file name matches the argument
       cCbuffer-namecA.

    cG0x04cA

       Bit set then an inactive buffer (i.e. a buffer whose contents have not
       been loaded) shall remain inactive and the buffer contents shall not
       be restored from file. This bit setting is used to allow the buffer
       variables to be interrogated without causing the file to load. Setting
       of this bit must be used with care.

    cG0x08cA

       Bit set causes the buffer to be hidden.

    cG0x10cA

       Forces the buffer to be hidden from all windows.

    cG0x20cA

       Stop the history of the outgoing buffer from being incremented.

    If the current buffer has an cC$buffer-ehookcA command set then this command
    is executed before the new buffer is switched in. If the new buffer has a
    $cCbuffer-bhookcA command set then this command is automatically executed
    after the new buffer is switched in but before control returns to the
    user.

       cCFree form textcA

    cD!ehelpcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDdefine-helpcA provides a mechanism to define help information for commands
    and variables within macro files. The command allows user defined macros
    to be documented with help information that is accessible from the command
    line via the normal help commands such as lshelp-item(2)lmhelp-item(2)le. 

    The help information is typically embedded in the macro file with the
    macro command that it is documenting. When the macro file is loaded then
    the help information is loaded and integrated into the existing help
    database.

    cCstringcA is the name of the item that is being defined, cCsectioncA defines what
    section the item belongs to. Following is a table of standard MicroEmacs
    2009 sections:

       `1 `MicroEmacs command line arguments.
       `2 `Built-in commands.
       `2m` MicroEmacs buffer modes.
       `3 `Macro commands.
       `4 `Macro language commands.
       `5 `MicroEmacs variables.
       `8 `MicroEmacs file formats.

    When cCsectioncA is omitted is defaults to the general section which is
    usually used for the higher level help pages.

    Text following the cDdefine-helpcA line contains the help information, this is
    a free form text area that is reproduced when the help information is
    requested. The end of the text area is delimited by a cD!ehelpcA construct.
    The help text is usually displayed using a special lshilight(2)lmhilighting schemele to
    control the colors and hyper-text links to other help pages. As a result
    the text may contain escape (cCcG^lsehf(8)lmcAcA) key sequences, see [ehf(8)le for more
    information on the format.

    Since MicroEmacs 091224b2 for the help text as well a subset of Markdown is 
    supported. See below for an example.

    cDforward-paragraphcA moves forwards cCncA paragraphs. The cursor is placed at the
    end of the cCncAth paragraph at the start of the blank paragraph separation
    line. The default value of cCncA is 1, if cCncA is negative then the direction is
    backwards.

    cDbackward-paragraphcA similarly moves backwards cCncA paragraphs. The cursor is
    placed at the start of the blank paragraph separation line. The default
    value of cCncA is 1, if cCncA is negative then the direction is forwards.


cEDIAGNOSTICS cA


    The following errors can be generated, in each case the command returns a

    cD[end of buffer]cA
 
       When moving forwards, the given argument cCncA was greater that the number
       of remaining paragraphs, the cursor is left at the end of the buffer.

    cD[top of buffer]cA
 
       When moving backwards, the given argument cCncA was greater than the
       number of paragraphs before the cursor, the cursor is left at the
       beginning of the buffer.

    cD0x01cA

       If there is no 'next' window because this is the last then if this bit
       is set the search for the next window is allow to continue with the
       first window of the frame. As the default argument cCncA is cG1cA this is the
       default behaviour.

    cD0x02cA

       When this bit is set windows whose ls$window-flags(5)lm$window-flags(5)le are set to be
       ignored by this command are not skipped. The setting of bit cG0x010cA of a
       windows cD$window-flagscA will make the default action of this command
       skip it which means the the command may not simply select the next
       window but the next window without this flag set. Setting this bit of
       the numeric argument will force the command to always select the next
       window.

    cD0x04cA

       When set the search for the next window starts at the first window
       instead of the current window, this can be used to find the first
       window in the current frame.

    cDprevious-windowcA makes the next window up the current window. The numeric
    argument cCncA has the same effect on this command as for cDnext-windowcA except
    bit cD0x04cA starts the search at the last window of the frame.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example visits every window in the current frame printing
    the buffer it displays with a second pause between each one:

sB
          ; go to the first window
          !force 6 next-window
          !while $status
              1000 ml-write $buffer-bname
              ; go to the next window - fail if this is the last
              !force 2 next-window
          !done

sA

cENOTES cA


    Both commands fail if a suitable window cannot be for, see the example on
    how this can be used.

|$ME_PIPE_STDERR
    cD$ME_PIPE_STDERRcA "cCstringcA"; Default is undefined.  


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDpipe-shell-commandcA executes one operating system command cCcommandcA and pipes
    the resulting output into a buffer with the name of cD*command*cA.

    The argument cCncA can be used to change the default behavior of
    pipe-shell-command described above, cCncA is a bit based flag where:-

    cD0x01cA

       Enables the use of the default buffer name cD*command*cA (default). If
       this bit is clear the user must supply a buffer name. This enables
       another command to be started without effecting any other command
       buffer.

    cD0x02cA

       Hides the output buffer, default action pops up a window and displays
       the output buffer in the new window.

    cD0x04cA

       Disable the use of the command-line processor to launch the program
       (win32 versions only). By default the "cDcommandcA" is launched by
       executing the command:

              %COMSPEC% /c command


       Where cG%COMSPEC%cA is typically command.com. If this bit is set, the
       "cDcommandcA" is launched directly.

    cD0x08cA

       Detach the launched process from MicroEmacs (win32 versions only). By
       default the command is launched as a child process of MicroEmacs with
       a new console. With this bit set the process is completely detached
       from MicroEmacs instead.

    cD0x10cA

       Disable the command name mangling (win32 versions only). By default
       any cCcG/cAcA characters found in the command name (the first argument only)
       are converted to cCcG\cAcA characters to make it Windows compliant.

    cD0x20cA

       Displays the new process window (win32 versions only), by default the
       window is hidden.

    cD0x40cA

       Raw mode, disable text annotation at the start of the pipe output.

    cD0x100cA

       When set the command-line to be run is the first line of buffer
       cCstringcA, this feature can be used to overcome the default 1024
       character command-line limit. When a multiple-line command-line is
       required, a negative argument can be given to lsinsert-string(2)lminsert-string(2)le.


cENOTES cA


    On MS-DOS and cCWin32scA the standard shell cDcommand.com(1)cA does not support
    the piping of cCstderrcA to a file. Other shells, such as cD4Dos.com(1)cA, do,
    using the command-line argument cGcG>&cAcA. If the environment variable
    cGcGME_PIPE_STDERRcAcA is defined (the value is not used) then MicroEmacs
    assumes that the current shell supports piping of stderr.

$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDscreen-pokecA cCrowcA cCcolumncA cCcolorSchemecA "cCstringcA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDscreen-pokecA writes a cCstringcA to the screen at position (cCrowcA, cCcolumncA) using
    the given color scheme. The screen coordinates are defined with (0,0) at
    the top left of the screen.

    cDscreen-pokecA by-passes the conventional buffer update and writes directly
    to the screen buffer. The command has no effect on buffers already showing
    on the screen and is erased on the next screen update. The cCstringcA is
    clipped to the screen area hence the caller need not continually check on
    the size of the client area.

    The numeric argument cCncA is a bitwise flag which has the following meaning  
    cG0x01cA Don't mark the poke area for update.  
    cG0x02cA Don't flush poke to screen.  
    cG0x04cA colorScheme is an array of values, one for each letter.  
    cG0xf0cA colorScheme pair offset to use.  

    If the cD0x01cA flag is absent then the parts of the screen over written by
    cDscreen-pokecA are marked and refreshed on the next cDscreen-updatecA operation,
    thereby erasing the poked information. If the flag is present the poked
    information remains on the screen until a forced refresh is performed
    (i.e. cD1 screen-updatecA) or the window information under the poked screen
    data is modified.

    In macros using many consecutive screen-pokes (e.g. lsPatience(3)lmPatience(3)le to display
    a pack of cards) most pokes use the 'No flush' flag to improve performance
    and look on some platforms.

    The use of cDscreen-pokecA has largely been reduced to games such as lsMetris(3)lmMetris(3)le
    since the introduction of lsosd(2)lmosd(2)le to create dialogs.

    popup-window - Pop-up a window on the screen
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDpopup-windowcA "cCnamecA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDpopup-windowcA manages the display of a new window on the screen. If only
    one window exists then it will be split else the current window will
    changed to one of the other existing visible windows. If the given buffer
    name "cCnamecA" is not null ("") then the buffer is created, if it does not
    exist, and swapped in.

    The numeric argument cCncA alters the behavior of the command as follows:

    cG0cA

       When cCncA is zero is given then the command only succeeds if the given
       buffer is already being displayed in an existing window, this window
       is made current.

    cG1cA

       When cCncA is 1 and the given buffer is not visible then a window
       displaying a system buffer is chosen in preference. A system buffer is
       one who's name starts with a cCcG*cAcA character, e.g. cGcG*help*cAcA. window used
       to display

    cG2cA

       When cCncA is 2 the frame containing the buffer is made current, this will
       interact with the window manager and bring MicroEmacs to the top of
       the window stack and bring it into focus. The cCnamecA argument is not
       required.

    cG3cA

       When cCncA is 3 then the frame position on the Desktop Window is allowed
       to be re-positioned, this is typically called after a font change or
       screen re-size operation and ensures that the MicroEmacs window is
       positioned on the screen. The cCnamecA argument is not required.

    cG4cA

       When cCncA is 4 then both the frame position and frame size on the Desktop
       Window is adjusted, this is the same as cG3cA except the frame size may
       also be adjusted to fit on the desktop. The cCnamecA argument is not
       required.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDprint-buffercA  
    cCncA cDprint-regioncA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDprint-buffercA and cDprint-regioncA print the current buffer or region,
    respectively, using high-lighting where appropriate. The hilighting
    assigned to a buffer is defined by the variable ls$buffer-hilight(5)lm$buffer-hilight(5)le the
    print scheme is defined with lsprint-scheme(2)lmprint-scheme(2)le, the lsscheme-editor(3)lmscheme-editor(3)le should
    be used to create printer schemes.

    The printing is typically configured using lsprint-setup(3)lmprint-setup(3)le, which can be
    found in the main menu under cDFile->Printer SetupcA.

    The numerical argument cCncA is generally used for macro development, it
    changes the default behaviour of these commands as follows:

    cD-2cA
 
       Configures the printer and, on win32 platforms, opens a Windows
       printing dialog box enabling the user to configure the printer, font
       and page layout. The configuration is stored in the cGcG/printcAcA registry.

    cD-1cA
 
       Configures the printer, the configuration is stored in the cGcG/printcAcA
       registry.

    cD0cA
 
       Configures the printer and, on win32 platforms, using the Windows
       printer, opens a Windows printing dialog box enabling the user to
       configure the printer, font and page layout. The required printing is
       then performed.

    cD1cA
 
       Configures the printer and performs the required printing.


cEPrinting Process  cA


    When either of these commands are executed the macro file cGprint.emfcA is
    executed to configure the printer (in a same vain as cGme.emfcA is executed to
    configure MicroEmacs for general usage). After the macro file has been
    executed the cGcG/printcAcA registry must contain the information required for
    printing. Following is a list of registry entries and their use:

    cDflagscA (cCintegercA)

cEPrinting Under Microsoft Windows Environments  cA


    Printing under Microsoft Windows Environments automatically invokes a
    dialog box to assign and configure the printer page characteristics. The
    dialog box allows the printer to be selected, enables line numbering,
    headers and footers.

    The dialog allows the user to select the font size, by defining the number
    of characters that appear on a logical page, and the number of logical
    pages that appear on a physical page. Selecting the logical and physical
    page characteristics determine the size of the font. For dense pages with
    a small typeface then a point size of 6 is appropriate. For clarity, a
    larger typeface of 10 or 12 points is advised.


cENOTES cA


    The last printer configuration selected by the user is held in the
    registry file cGcGprint.erfcAcA which is loaded into the cC/print-historycA registry
    section. This feature is implemented in the macro file cGprint.emfcA.


cEBUGS cA


    Landscape printing under Microsoft Windows environments is temperamental.

    Font selection under Microsoft Windows environments does not always
    determine the most appropriate font size.

    The printer interface does not support native postscript generation. (In

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDquick-exitcA (cDesc zcA) [cCexitCodecA]  
    cDsave-buffers-exit-emacscA (cDC-x C-ccA) [cCexitCodecA]


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDquick-exitcA writes out all changed buffers to the files they were read
    from, saves all changed dictionaries, killing any running commands and
    exits the editor.

    The numeric argument is defined as follows:

    cG0cA
    
        A zero numeric argument then the editor is closed down and any unsaved
       buffers are lost.

    cG1cA
    
       Prompting the user before saving any files, writes out all changed
       buffers to the files they were read from. Saves all changed
       dictionaries, killing any running commands and exits the editor.

    cG2cA

       Discard changed buffers (except the history and registry) and delete
       any backup files associated with the edited buffer(s). Only valid with
       cDquick-exitcA.

    cDsave-buffers-exit-emacscA prompts the user before saving any files, writes
    out all changed buffers to the files they were read from. Saves all
    changed dictionaries, killing any running commands and exits the editor.


cEMACRO INTERACTION cA


    If the macro lsshut-down(3)lmshut-down(3)le is defined then it is invoked by the editor when
    it is closed. A user defined shutdown action may be associated with the
    close operation. It is the callers responsibility that the macro
    terminates correctly otherwise the editor will hang.

    For macros development then the lsexit-emacs(2)lmexit-emacs(2)le command provides better
    control of the exit process than cDquick-exitcA and cDsave-buffers-exit-emacscA
    and should be used instead. cDsave-buffers-exit-emacscA is actually
    implemented as cD3 exit-emacscA.


cENOTES cA


    All buffers with a name starting with a 'cCcC*cAcA' are assumed to be system
    buffer (i.e. cD*scratch*cA) and are not saved.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDrcs-filecA (cDC-x C-qcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    MicroEmacs 2009 RCS support command. The action of this command depends on
    the current buffer lsview(2m)lmview(2m)le mode state, the argument cCncA, and the existence
    of an RCS file.

    cDview-mode ON; RCS file does not existcA
 
       Removes buffer view mode to enable the user to edit the file.

    cDview-mode ON; RCS file existscA
 
       MicroEmacs attempts to check out the file using the command line given
       by the variable ls$rcs-cou-com(5)lm$rcs-cou-com(5)le (co unlock). The file is then reloaded
       and the view mode status re-evaluated.

    cDview-mode OFF; RCS file does not existcA
 
       MicroEmacs attempts to check-in the file into RCS for the first time
       using the command-line given by the variable ls$rcs-cif-com(5)lm$rcs-cif-com(5)le (ci
       first). The file is then reload.

    cDview-mode OFF; RCS file existscA
 
       MicroEmacs attempts to check-in the file into RCS using the
       command-line given by the variable ls$rcs-ci-com(5)lm$rcs-ci-com(5)le. The file is then
       reload.

    read-file - Find and load file replacing current buffer
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDread-filecA "cCfile-namecA" (cDC-x C-rcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDread-filecA operates like lsfind-file(2)lmfind-file(2)le, this command either finds the file
    in a buffer, or creates a new buffer and reads the file in. The command
    destroys the current buffer before the new buffer is created making this
    command ideal to use when the wrong file was entered on a lsfind-file(2)lmfind-file(2)le.
    This command is also useful for re-loading files that have changed on
    disk.

    The numeric argument cCncA can be used to modify the default behaviour of the
    command, where the bits are defined as follows:

    cD0x01cA
 
       If the file does not exist and this bit is not set the command fails
       at this point. If the file does not exist and this bit is set (or no
       argument is specified as the default argument is cG1cA) then a new empty
       buffer is created with the given file name, saving the buffer
       subsequently creates a new file.

    cD0x02cA
 
       If this bit is set the file will be loaded with lsbinary(2m)lmbinary(2m)le mode
       enabled. See help on cDbinarycA mode for more information on editing
       binary data files.

    cD0x04cA
 
       If this bit is set the file will be loaded with lscrypt(2m)lmcrypt(2m)le mode
       enabled. See help on cDcryptcA mode for more information on editing
       encrypted files.

    cD0x08cA
 
       If this bit is set the file will be loaded with lsrbin(2m)lmrbin(2m)le mode enabled.
       See help on cDrbincA mode for more information on efficient editing of
       binary data files.

    cD0x10cA
 
       If this bit is set then the file hook evaluation is not performed when
       the file is loaded (i.e. the lsfileHooks(2)lmbuffer's file hookle is not executed).

    cD0x20cA
 
       Disables loss of work checks, if this bit is set then the contents of
       the buffer is destroyed without any user prompts (useful in macros).

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDreplace-stringcA replaces all occurrences of one string with another string.
    The replacement starts at the current location of the cursor and goes to
    the end of the current buffer.

    A numeric argument positive cCncA limits the number of strings replaced to cCncA.
    A negative argument cCncA limits the number of lines in which the replacement
    may take place, e.g. a value of -15 restricts the replacement of the
    string to the next 15 lines from the current cursor position.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDset-positioncA "cClabelcA"  
    cCncA cDgoto-positioncA "cClabelcA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDset-positioncA stores current window, buffer, cursor and mark position
    information against the given cCcGlabelcAcA (a single alpha-numeric character).

    cDgoto-positioncA takes the positional information stored against the given
    cCcGlabelcAcA and restores the window, buffer and cursor positions from those
    previously cDsetcA.

    A call to cDset-positioncA with the same label over-writes the previous stored
    information, a call to cDgoto-positioncA does not alter the information and
    may be restored multiple times.

    The numerical argument to cDset-positioncA is used to define the information
    that is stored in the position item. The argument is intrepreted as a
    bitmask, flagging what information is to be stored. The bit mask is
    defined as follows:



    cG0x001cA
    
       Store the current window.

    cG0x002cA
    
       Store the current window's horizonal scroll (value of
       ls$window-x-scroll(5)lm$window-x-scroll(5)le).

    cG0x004cA
    
       Store the current window's current line horizonal scroll (value of
       ls$window-xcl-scroll(5)lm$window-xcl-scroll(5)le).

    cG0x008cA
    
       Store the current window's vertical scroll (value of
       ls$window-y-scroll(5)lm$window-y-scroll(5)le).

    cG0x010cA
    
       Store the current buffer.

    cG0x020cA
    
       Store the current window's current line using an lsset-alpha-mark(2)lmalpha markle.

    cG0x040cA
    
       Store the current window's current line number (value of
       ls$window-line(5)lm$window-line(5)le).

    cG0x080cA
    
       Store the current window's current column offset (value of
       ls$window-col(5)lm$window-col(5)le).

    cG0x100cA
    
       Store the current window's mark line using an lsset-alpha-mark(2)lmalpha markle.

    cG0x200cA
    
       Store the current window's mark line number (value of ls$window-line(5)lm$window-line(5)le
       when mark was set).

    cG0x400cA
    
       Store the current window's mark column offset (value of ls$window-col(5)lm$window-col(5)le
       when mark was set).

    When cCncA is not specified, the default value is cG0x0bfcA, i.e. store all
    information required to return to the window, buffer and cursor position.

    The argument supplied to cDgoto-positioncA similarly interpreted as a bitmask,
    restoring the positional information. When the numerical argument cCncA is
    omitted the same default is used when omitted on the store. On restoring a
    position, information stored during the call to cDset-positioncA which is not
    requested in corresponding cDgotocA is ignored, similarly information
    requested in a cDgotocA which was not stored in the cDsetcA is also ignored.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example shows the typical use of these commands:

sB
          set-position "a"
              .
              .
          goto-position "a"

sA
    The following example stores the current position at the start of a macro
    sequence, if cGmy-commandcA is not successful (cD$statuscA equals 0) the original
    position is restored:

sB
          set-position "\x80"
          !force my-command
          !if &equ $status 0
              ; command failed, return to the original position
              goto-position "\x80"
          !endif

sA
    Note cCcG\x80cAcA is interpreted as the character with the ASCII value of 0x80
    which is a non-alphanumeric character, this is permitted in macros to
    avoid using alphanumerics.

    The following example shows how the current position can be restored after
    re-reading a file:

sB
          0xce set-position
          read-file $buffer-fname @mna
          ; a numeric argument of 0xce is not
          ; required as this is the default
          goto-position

sA

cENOTES cA


    The position item may store and restore the current line by using an alpha
    mark or the line number. The restrore strategy will determine what is
    required, as follows:-

    The main benefit from using an alpha mark is that the position is
    maintained even when the buffer is edited, for example if the position is
    stored at line 10 and a line is subsequently inserted at the top of the
    buffer, if the line number was used then it would return back to the 10th
    line which is the old 9th line whereas if an alpha mark were used it would
    correctly return to the 11th line, as expected.

    The disadvantage of using an alpha mark is that it is only associated with
    that buffer. In some cases a position may need to be restored in another
    buffer (e.g. when re-reading a buffer the original buffer may be deleted
    first), in this situation the buffer line number must be used.

    Commands cDset-windowcA and cDgoto-windowcA, which simple stored and returned to
    the current window, were replaced by set-position and goto-position in
    August 2000. The following macro implementations can be used as a
    replacement:

sB
          define-macro set-window
              1 set-position "\x80"
          !emacro

          define-macro goto-window
              goto-position "\x80"

cESYNOPSIS cA

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    Every region killed goes onto a stack, with the most recent at the top.

    with cCncA insertions of the next region on the kill stack. Another call to
    reyank deletes that region and replaces it with the next in the stack etc.

    The default behavior of cDreyankcA is to wrap around the kill chain in a loop
    (i.e. returns to the start of the list when the end of the kill chain is
    reached). If a negative argument cCncA is specified then cDreyankcA fails when the
    end of the kill chain is reached rather than looping back to the start of
    the list.

    The last 15 kills are stored.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDsave-dictionarycA may be used to save one, or all changed, dictionaries back
    to disk. By default cDsave-dictionarycA prompts for a single dictionary, which
    is then saved. If the dictionary to be saved has been created within the
    session (rather than read from disk) the user is always prompted to save
    and enter a full dictionary file name (pathname) to save to. If the
    dictionary was not created then the user is only prompted to save if,

    - a non-zero argument is supplied
    - and the users history registry node "cC/history/spell/autosavecA" does
          not exist or its value is zero.

    Otherwise the dictionary is automatically saved.

    The argument cCncA may be used to control the effect of the command, cCncA is a
    bit based flag defined as follows:-

    cD0x01cA

$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDsave-buffercA (cDC-x C-scA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDsave-buffercA saves the contents of the current buffer if the contents have
    been changed, writing the buffer back to the file it was read from.

    On saving the file, if lstime(2m)lmtime(2m)le mode is enabled then the ls$timestamp(5)lmtime stamp stringle
    is searched for in the file and modified if located, to reflect the
    modification date and time.

    If lsbackup(2m)lmbackup(2m)le mode is enabled then a backup copy of the file existing is
    created and the contents of the buffer are written to the file. Any
    ls$auto-time(5)lmautomatic savele copies of the file are deleted.

    If the buffer contains a lsnarrow(2m)lmnarrow(2m)le it will automatically be removed
    before saving so that the whole buffer is saved and restored when saving
    is complete

    If lsauto(2m)lmauto(2m)le mode is enabled the the file is written out in the style
    indicated by modes lscr(2m)lmcr(2m)le, lslf(2m)lmlf(2m)le and lsctrlz(2m)lmctrlz(2m)le. Otherwise the file is
    written out in the style on the current platform.

    The argument cCncA can be used to change the default behavior of save-buffer
    described above, cCncA is a bit based flag where:-


    cD0x01cA
 
       Enables validity checks (default). These include check that the buffer
       has been modified, if not an error occurs. Also the time stamp of the
       file to be written is checked, if the file systems file exists and is
       newer the confirmation of writing is requested from the user. If this
       flag is not supplied then the buffer is written whenever possible and
       without any prompts to the user.

    cD0x02cA
 
       Disables the expansion of any narrows (see lsnarrow-buffer(2)lmnarrow-buffer(2)le) before
       saving the buffer. That is, the buffer is saved as it appears on the
       screen and the content of any narrow regions is discarded.


cENOTES cA


    - lsundo(2)lmundo(2)le information is discarded when the file is saved.

cESYNOPSIS cA

    cCncA cDsearch-backwardcA "cCstringcA" (cDC-x rcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDsearch-forwardcA searches for a string from the current cursor position to
    the end of the file. The string is typed on the bottom line of the screen,
    and terminated with the cG<ESC>cA key. Special characters can be typed in by
    preceding them with a cG^QcA. A single cG^QcA indicates a null string. On
    successive searches, hitting cG<ESC>cA alone causes the last search string to
    be reused.

    Searching is affected by lsmagic(2m)lmmagic(2m)le mode, which allows regular expression
    pattern matching, and lsexact(2m)lmexact(2m)le mode which makes the search case
    sensitive.

    The numeric argument cCncA is interpreted as follows:-

    cDn > 0cA
 
       The cCncAth occurrence of the cCstringcA is located.

    cDn < 0cA
 
      The first occurrence of the cCstringcA is located in the next cCncA lines.

    cDsearch-forwardcA does not search through text that is hidden with
    lsnarrow-buffer(2)lmnarrow-buffer(2)le. Where a search through hidden regions is required then
    lsnarrow-search-forward(3)lmnarrow-search-forward(3)le should be used instead.

    cDsearch-backwardcA searches backwards in the file. In all other ways it is
    like cDsearch-forwardcA.


cEDIAGNOSTICS cA


    The command returns a status of cGFALSEcA if the cCstringcA could not be located
    (or cCncAth cCstringcA where cCncA occurrences are requested). If the cCstringcA is found
    within the given search criteria the return status is cGTRUEcA.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The abbreviation files allow the user to define a set of short-cut
    expansion text, whereby a short sequence of chararacters are associated
    with a longer text segment. When the short sequence is entered, the user
    may elect to maually expand the sequnce with the associated replacement
    text. Provision for cursor positioning may be made in the replacement
    text.

    cDbuffer-abbrev-filecA sets the current buffer's abbreviation file (limit of
    one abbreviation file per buffer). cDbuffer-abbrev-filecA does the minimal
    amount of work to increase speed at load-up. The first use of
    lsexpand-abbrev(2)lmexpand-abbrev(2)le attempts to load the abbreviation file at which point
    errors may be reported.

    An argument cCncA of zero, forces the buffer abbreviation file to be uncached,
    such that the next abbreviation that is expanded forces a re-load of the
    abbreviation file. This is typically only used when an abbreviation file
    is being constructed and tested.

    cDglobal-abbrev-filecA assigns a global set of abbreviations accross ALL
    buffers, such that the abbreviation is available regardless of the current
    buffer type. The global abbreviation file has a lower presidence than the
    cDbuffer-abbrev-filecA, hence the currently assigned cDbuffer-abbrev-filecA is
    searched before the cDglobal-abbrev-filecA.

    Similarly for cDglobal-abbrev-filecA, an argument of zero forces the global
    abbreviation file to be uncached and re-loaded on the next use.

    An abbreviation is a string which is expanded to an alternate form, e.g.

    cDe.g.cA -> cDfor examplecA

    or

    cDPIcA -> cD3.1415926536cA

    etc.

    An abbreviation file is an ordinary text file with a strict format, it is
    loaded only once at the first call to lsexpand-abbrev(2)lmexpand-abbrev(2)le, from then on it
    reminds buffered. An abbreviation file has an abbreviation per line, they
    cannot use multiple lines. This is not a draw back as the expansion string
    is executed using lsexecute-string(2)lmexecute-string(2)le so any MicroEmacs 2009 command may
    also be called.

    For example the following expansion string inserts the string cGcG!continuecAcA
    and a newline:-

       cG"!continue\r"cA

    Note that cCcG\rcAcA is used instead of cCcG\ncAcA as cDC-mcA is bound to lsnewline(2)lmnewline(2)le and
    not cDC-jcA. The expansion string can also make use of a few useful
    abbreviations:-

       cD\pcA
    
            Mark the current position (expanded to "C-x C-a P")

       cD\PcA
    
            Move cursor to the marked position (expanded to "C-x a P")

    See help on lsexecute-string(2)lmexecute-string(2)le for more useful abbreviations.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The abbreviation must be on the left hand side followed by at least 1
    space, the expansion string must then be on the same line in quotes. So
    for the given examples, the abbreviation file would be:

       |
       |e.g. "for example"
       |PI   "3.1415926536"
       |


    The following abbreviation could be used for a C cCif-elsecA statement.

       |
       |if "if(\p)\r{\r\r}\relse\r{\r\r}\r\P"
       |


    This is particularly useful for email address, e.g.

       |
       |JA "\"JASSPA\" <support@jasspa.com>"
       |


    The following example is MicroEmacs 2009 C-Mode abbreviation file for
    constructing C files. Remember cD\pcA is where the cursor is positioned
    following the expansion.

       #i "#include <\p>\r\P"
       #d "#define "
       if "if(\p)\r{\r\r}\r\P"
       ef "else if(\p)\r{\r\r}\r\P"
       el "else\r{\r\p\r}\r\P"
       wh "while(\p)\r{\r\r}\r\P"
       sw "switch(\p)\r{\rcase :\rdefault:\r}\r\P"


cENOTES cA


    Abbreviation files are given the extension cD.eafcA in the MicroEmacs 2009
    home directory.

    One of the easiest ways to create more complex abbreviations is to record
    a keyboard macro, name it and then insert the resultant macro. See notes
    on commands lsstart-kbd-macro(2)lmstart-kbd-macro(2)le, lsname-kbd-macro(2)lmname-kbd-macro(2)le and lsinsert-macro(2)lminsert-macro(2)le.

    Try to avoid using named key, such as cGcGupcAcA and cGcGreturncAcA, as the keyboard
    macro equivalent is not readable and is likely to change in future
    releases.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDset-cursor-to-mousecA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDset-cursor-to-mousecA sets the current window and cursor position to the
    location of the mouse on it's last event (button press or release). This
    command may change the current window. If the line on which the mouse was
    located was the message line then the no action is taken, if the line was
    a window mode line the that window is made the current window but the
    cursor location within the window remains the same. This is usually used
    in user defined macros that control the functionality of the mouse.

    Invocation of this command sets the variable ls$mouse-pos(5)lm$mouse-pos(5)le which
    determines where the mouse is within the window. Interrogation of the
    variable following the command may be used to determine if the mouse is
    located on one of the more specialized window or screen regions.

    An argument cCncA determines if the command is permitted to change windows and
    cursor position, where the bits are defined as follows:

    cD0x01cA
 
       Permit changing of the current window, if not permitted and the mouse
       is not in the current window cDset-cursor-to-mousecA returns an error
       condition in ls$mouse-pos(5)lm$mouse-pos(5)le.

    cD0x02cA
 
       Permit changing of the cursor position.

    The default argument when omitted is cC3cA, allowing the changing of both.

    When writing macros to cut and paste using the mouse, care should be taken
    to ensure that the window at the button release is the same is at the
    button press. If this is not undertaken, undesired effects could result.
    The use of lsset-position(2)lmset-position(2)le and lsgoto-position(2)lmgoto-position(2)le are most usefully used
    with this command to restore existing window context.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDset-markcA (cDesc spacecA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDset-markcA is used to delimit the beginning of a marked region. Many
    commands are effective for a region of text. A region is defined as the
    text between the mark and the current cursor position. To delete a section
    of text, for example, one moves the cursor to the beginning of the text to
    be deleted, issues the cDset-markcA command by typing cDesc spacecA, moves the
    cursor to the end of the text to be deleted, and then deletes it by using
    the lskill-region(2)lmkill-region(2)le (cDC-wcA) command.  
    Only one mark can be set in one window
    or one buffer at a time, and MicroEmacs 2009 will try to remember a mark
    set in an off screen buffer when it is called back on screen.

    A region is a block of text to be acted upon by some MicroEmacs commands.
    It is demarcated by the cDPOINTcA on one end and the cDMARKcA at the other. The
    point is the primary location identifier where most of the action takes
    place and is always between two characters. The point is indicated by the
    cursor position in that it is just left of the cursor. The point is also
    significant in that it defines one end of the region. The mark, on the
    other hand, is invisible, and is used to demarcate the other end of the
    region and is set through cDset-markcA.

    The current buffer mark line and column position may be obtained from
    within a macro using the variables ls$window-mark-line(5)lm$window-mark-line(5)le and
    ls$window-mark-col(5)lm$window-mark-col(5)le.

    cDset-variablecA sets the given register (cD#cA name), system (cD$cA name), global (cD%cA
    name), buffer (cD:cA name) or command (cD.cA name) variable to the given value,
    erasing its current value. The returned value of an undefined variable is
    the string cGcGERRORcAcA, this maybe used to determine whether a variable has
    been set.

    cDunset-variablecA unsets the given variable so that it no longer exists. The
    variable must be a global (cD%cA), buffer (cD:cA) or command (cD.cA) variable, system
    (cD$cA) variables cannot be unset.

    The cCvaluecA may be quoted or unquoted, if there are any white space
    characters, or characters open to other interpretation (e.g. cD@wccA) in cCvaluecA
    then quotes should be used.

    cCvaluecA may contain control characters which are delimited by a back slash
    (cD\cA) which include:-

       `\n` newline
       `\t` tab
       `\\` backslash

    Confusion sometimes arises in macros with the back slash, as the back
    slashes are dereferenced when set. Commands such as lsreplace-string(2)lmreplace-string(2)le
    where the command itself utilizes back slashes. In this case the number of
    back slashes should be doubled as the variable contents under go two
    stages of dereferencing.

    append-buffer - Write contents of buffer to end of named file
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDappend-buffercA "cCfile-namecA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDappend-buffercA is used to write the contents of the current buffer into an
    EXISTING file. Use lssave-buffer(2)lmsave-buffer(2)le if the buffer is to over-write the
    existing file already associated with the buffer. Use lswrite-buffer(2)lmwrite-buffer(2)le if
    the buffer is to be written out to a new file, or to replace an existing
    file.

    cDappend-buffercA writes the contents of the current buffer to the named file
    cCfile-namecA. But unlike lswrite-buffer(2)lmwrite-buffer(2)le the action of the write does not
    change the attributes associated with the file (if it exists), it also
    does not effect the stats of the current buffer.

    On writing the file, append-buffer ignores the lstime(2m)lmtime(2m)le and lsbackup(2m)lmbackup(2m)le
    mode settings. The current buffer will not be time stamped and a backup
    will not be created for "cCfile-namecA". If the buffer contains a lsnarrow(2m)lmnarrow(2m)le
    it will automatically be removed before saving so that the whole buffer is
    saved and restored when saving is complete

    The argument cCncA is a bit based flag, where:-

    cD0x01cA
 
       Enables validity checks (default). These include a check that the
       given file already exist, if not confirmation of writing is requested
       from the user. Without this flag the command will always succeed
       wherever possible. If "cCfile-namecA" does not exist the buffer is written
       out in a similar fashion to using the command lswrite-buffer(2)lmwrite-buffer(2)le.

    cD0x02cA
 
       Disables the expansion of any narrows (see lsnarrow-buffer(2)lmnarrow-buffer(2)le) before
       appending the buffer.

    cD0x04cA
 
       Truncate the existing file before writing out the contents of the
       buffer. This means that the file will consist solely of the contents
       of the buffer, but it will still have the file attributes of the
       original file.

    If cCncA is not specified then the default argument of 1 is used.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example appends the current buffer onto the end of a file,
    creating the file if it does not exists

sB
          append-buffer "things_to_do.txt"

sA
    The following example truncates the users email file while maintaining the
    file attributes. This is taken from lsvm(3)lmvm(3)le where it is used to remove the
    current mail from the system mail box.

sB
       find-buffer "*vm-empty-buffer"
       -1 buffer-mode "ctrlz"
       5 append-buffer %vm-mail-src
       delete-buffer $buffer-bname
sA

    Note that the macro ensures that lsctrlz(2m)lmctrlz(2m)le mode is removed. If it was
    enabled then the file written would not be empty.

    the lsset-mark(2)lmmarkle position to the current cursor position. If the buffer mode
    lsexact(2m)lmexact(2m)le is enabled then the sort is case sensitive, otherwise the sort
    is case insensitive. By default the text is compared from left to right
    from column 0 (the left hand edge), if a positive argument cCncA is given then
    the text is compared left to right from the cCncAth column, any lines shorter
    than cCncA characters are moved to the top and sorted from column 0.

    If a negative argument cCncA is given then the text is sorted in reverse
    order. The comparison starts at column cG-1-ncA, i.e. an argument of -1 sorts
    in reverse order from column 0.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDspellcA ["cCwordcA"] ["cCrulescA"] ["cCcorrectioncA"] ["cCrulecA"]


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDspellcA is a low level command which provides spell checking capabilities
    for MicroEmacs 2009, it is not designed to be used directly. The action of
    cDspellcA depends on the argument given, which is a bitwise flag defined as
    follows:-

    cD0x001cA
 
       If set then gets the input word from the user, i.e. "cCwordcA" must be
       supplied. Otherwise the word input is taken from the current buffer.

    cD0x002cA
 
       If set then keeps getting words from the current buffer until either
       the end of the buffer is reached or an error is found. If the end of
       the buffer is reached then the command succeeds setting ls$result(5)lm$result(5)le to
       the value "cCFcA". This bit is ignored if bit 0x001 is set. cDspellcA sets the
       current show-region to enclose the problematical word and the command
       lsshow-region(2)lmshow-region(2)le can be used to move around the word.

    cD0x004cA
 
       Adds the given word to a dictionary determined by the state of bit
       0x008. If the word is flagged as erroneous (see bit 0x010) then a
       "cCcorrectioncA" word must be supplied, otherwise a list of "cCrulescA" which
       can be applied to the word must be given, this list can be empty. Note
       that if the word is not flagged as erroneous and it already exists in
       the dictionary, the word is not removed, instead a combined rule list
       is created.

    cD0x008cA
 
       When set flags that word additions (bit 0x004) and deletions (bit
       0x200) should be made to the ignore dictionary. Otherwise word
       additions are made the last added dictionary and deletions are made to
       all main dictionaries.

    cD0x010cA
 
       When set flags that the given word is erroneous, used solely by word
       additions to create auto-corrections.

    cD0x020cA
 
       Returns a 'cC|cA' separated guess list for the given word in cD$resultcA.

    cD0x040cA
 
       If bit cD0x100cA is also set a complete list of valid words derivable from
       the given word are inserted into the current buffer. Otherwise spell
       returns ls$result(5)lm$result(5)le set to the derivative word created when the given
       "cCrulecA" is applied to "cCwordcA". The rule applied is the first found of
       the given rule letter with a matching base ending (see
       lsadd-spell-rule(2)lmadd-spell-rule(2)le). The word need not exist as not tests for the
       legality of the resultant word is used, for example in American,
       executing


           65 spell "spelling" "V"


       returns "`spellingive`" in __$result__. Returns the empty string if no rule
       could be applied.

    cD0x080cA
 
       Used with bit 0x002 to enable double word checking.

    cD0x100cA
 
       Return information in cD$resultcA about the given word, or the word which
       is used to derive the given word. The information consists of the
       spell status, the word as stored in the dictionary, and either the
       list of valid rules, or the correction word. See also bit cD0x040cA.

    cD0x200cA
 
       Delete the given word from a dictionary determined by bit 0x008

    If none of the main functions are used (bits 0x004, 0x020, 0x040 & 0x200)
    then the status flag is returned in the first column of cD$resultcA. These are
    defined as follows:-

    cDAcA
 
       Auto-replace. The word was found and flagged as erroneous. The
       correction word is given in cD$resultcA, either next to the flag, or if
       bit 0x100 is set then after the 'cC>cA' character.

    cDDcA
 
       Double word. Indicates that the first problem found is a double
       occurrence of the same word one after the other.

    cDEcA
 
       Erroneous. The word was not found, so is Erroneous

    cDNcA
 
       Not a word. The current word found contains no alphabetic characters
       so is not deemed to be a word, e.g. 3.141593.

    cDOcA
 
       Okay. The word was found and is not an erroneous word.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDnext-window-find-filecA "cCfilecA" (cDC-x 4cA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDnext-window-find-filecA splits the current window into two near equal
    windows, and loads the given cCfilecA into the current window. It is
    effectively a lssplit-window-vertically(2)lmsplit-window-vertically(2)le command followed by a
    lsfind-file(2)lmfind-file(2)le.

    When there is insufficient space in the current window to perform the
    split, then the current window is replaced. The requested cCfilecA is always
    displayed, if the file does not already exist it is effectively created
    within MicroEmacs (although it will not exist on the disk until a save
    operation is performed).

    The numeric argument cCncA can be used to modify the default behaviour of the
    command, where the bits are defined as follows:

    cD0x01cA
 
       If the file does not exist and this bit is not set the command fails
       at this point. If the file does not exist and this bit is set (or no
       argument is specified as the default argument is cG1cA) then a new empty
       buffer is created with the given file name, saving the buffer
       subsequently creates a new file.

    cD0x02cA
 
       If this bit is set the file will be loaded with lsbinary(2m)lmbinary(2m)le mode
       enabled. See help on cDbinarycA mode for more information on editing
       binary data files.

    cD0x04cA
 
       If this bit is set the file will be loaded with lscrypt(2m)lmcrypt(2m)le mode

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDprint-colorcA and cDprint-schemecA are similar to lsadd-color(2)lmadd-color(2)le and
    lsadd-color-scheme(2)lmadd-color-scheme(2)le except they configure MicroEmacs's printer scheme.

    cDprint-colorcA creates a new printer color and inserts it into the printer
    color table, where cCredcA, cCgreencA and cCbluecA are the color components and cCcol-nocA
    is the printer color index. The printer color table contains 256 entries
    indexed by cCcol-nocA in the range 0-255. cDprint-colorcA may also be used to
    modify an existing cCcol-nocA index by re-assignment, the existing color
    definition is over-written with the new color definition.

    An argument cCncA of 0 to cDprint-colorcA resets the printer color table, removing
    all currently defined colors.

    cDprint-schemecA creates a new printer scheme. A printer scheme maps the
    lshilight(2)lmhilight(2)le buffer's text into a print scheme. For example key words could
    be printed in cCboldcA or in cCbluecA etc. cDprint-schemecA arguments comprise an
    identifying index number "cCschemeNumcA", two color values, "cCforecA" and "cCbackcA"
    (defined by cDprint-colorcA) and a font setting "cCfont-maskcA". The cCfont-maskcA is
    a bit mask where each bit is defined as follows:

       `0x01` Enable bold font.
       `0x02` Enable italic font.
       `0x04` Enable light font.
       `0x08` Enable reverse font.
       `0x10` Enable underlining.

    An argument cCncA of 0 to cDprint-schemecA resets the printer scheme table,
    removing all currently defined printer schemes.


cENOTES cA


    Printer schemes may be created and altered using the lsscheme-editor(3)lmscheme-editor(3)le
    dialog, the created printer scheme may then be used directly in the
    lsprint-setup(3)lmprint-setup(3)le dialog. Therefore direct use of these commands is largely

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDshell-commandcA "cCstringcA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDshell-commandcA performs an operating system call with the given cCstringcA as
    its argument. The command only fails if the shell-command call returns -1.
    The ls$result(5)lm$result(5)le variable is set the return value and can be used to test
    the result.

    The argument cCncA can be used to change the default behavior of the
    shell-command, cCncA is a bit based flag where:-

    cD0x01cA
 
       When set shell-command waits for the command to complete, this is the
       default behavior. When not set the command is launched and forgotten
       about, the value returned in ls$result(5)lm$result(5)le will not reflect the exit code
       of the executed process itself.

    cD0x04cA
 
       Disable the use of the command-line processor to launch the program
       (win32 versions only). By default the "cDcommandcA" is launched by
       executing the command:

              %COMSPEC% /c command


       Where cG%COMSPEC%cA is typically command.com. If this bit is set, the
       "cDcommandcA" is launched directly.

    cD0x08cA
 
       Detach the launched process from MicroEmacs (win32 versions only). By
       default the command is launched as a child process of MicroEmacs with
       a new console. With this bit set the process is completely detached
       from MicroEmacs instead.

    cD0x10cA
 
       Disable the command name mangling (win32 versions only). By default
       any cCcG/cAcA characters found in the command name (the first argument only)
       are converted to cCcG\cAcA characters to make it Windows compliant.

    cD0x20cA
 
       Displays the new process window (win32 versions only), by default the
       window is hidden.

    cD0x100cA
 
       When set the command-line to be run is the first line of buffer
       cCstringcA, this feature can be used to overcome the default 1024
       character command-line limit. When a multiple-line command-line is
       required, a negative argument can be given to lsinsert-string(2)lminsert-string(2)le.

    cD0x200cA
 
       No wait option, when set the the command is run without waiting for
       any completion status. This allows processes to be run and then
       forgotten about e.g. a Word processor, Adobe Acrobat reader etc.

$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDshow-regioncA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDshow-regioncA manipulates the currently defined region, it can be used to
    inquire the state of the current region, if any. It can also be used to
    define a region, enable and disable the region hilighting, as well as move
    the cursor to the start or end of the region.

    Region hilighting occurs between the cCmarkcA (see lsset-mark(2)lmset-mark(2)le) and cCpointcA
    (current cursor) positions within the current buffer. A region is defined
    when text is copied to the kill buffer, by using any of the kill commands
    such as lskill-region(2)lmkill-region(2)le, or lscopy-region(2)lmcopy-region(2)le. However, the kill region is
    only visible after a lscopy-region(2)lmcopy-region(2)le or a lsyank(2)lmyank(2)le operation. A hilight
    region is also created on a successful search using commands like
    lssearch-forward(2)lmsearch-forward(2)le, the region encloses the search matching string.
    lsspell(2)lmSpell(2)le also creates a hilight region around the current spell word. The
    user can also define their own region using the numeric argument to
    cDshow-regioncA.

    The argument cCncA supplied to the command indicates the require functionality
    and can take the following values:-

       `-3` - Set the start position of the region.
       `-2` - Move the cursor the  Mark position.
       `-1` - Disable the hilighting of the current region.
       ` 0` - Return the current status of the region in [$result(5)]($result(5)).
       ` 1` - Enable the hilighting of the current region.
       ` 2` - Move the cursor the  Dot position.
       ` 3` - Set the end position of the region.
       ` 4` - Reactivate the current region.

    Where an argument of 0 is used to return the current state the value of
    $result is a bit based flag where:-

    cD0x01cA
 
       Indicates a region is currently active (visible).

    cD0x02cA
 
       Indicates a region has been fixed (may not visible).

    cD0x04cA
 
       Indicates the region is in the current buffer.

    cD0x08cA
 
       Indicates the cursor is in the current region.

    The color of the selection hilight is defined by lsadd-color-scheme(2)lmadd-color-scheme(2)le and
    is determined by ls$buffer-scheme(5)lm$buffer-scheme(5)le, ls$global-scheme(5)lm$global-scheme(5)le or
    ls$buffer-hilight(5)lm$buffer-hilight(5)le.


cEDIAGNOSTICS cA


    The following errors can be generated, in each case the command returns a
    FALSE status:

    cD[No current region]cA
 
       There is no current defined region on which to operate.

    cD[Current region not in this buffer]cA
 
       An argument of 2 or -2 was used and the defined region isn't in the
       current window so the cursor can not be moved to it.


cENOTES cA


    If no argument is given to the command it hilights the current region,
    similar to an argument of 1. But the properties of the hilight, namely how
    long it will be hilighted for, are inherited from the setting of
    ls$show-region(5)lm$show-region(5)le, whereas if an argument of 1 is passed in then the
    hilighting is set to be kept until the region becomes invalid (i.e. as if
    ls$show-region(5)lm$show-region(5)le is set to 3).

$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDtranslate-keycA [ "cCfromcA" ["cCtocA"] ]


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDtranslate-keycA may be used to convert any given input key sequence to
    another single key. cDtranslate-keycA operates at a very low level, before
    MicroEmacs attempts to evaluate keyboard bindings, so it may be used to
    solve a variety of keyboard problems such as special language characters
    and UNIX termcap key sequence bindings (see below).

    If a positive numeric argument cCncA is given it is used to set the time in
    milliseconds MicroEmacs waits for another key to be pressed before
    continuing, the default time use when no argument is supplied is 250ms.

    If a numeric argument cCncA of -1 is specified then the "cCtocA" argument is not
    required and the "cCfromcA" character sequence is removed from the translate
    key table.

    If a numeric argument cCncA of 0 is specified then no arguments are required;
    the current translation table is dumped to buffer "cC*tcap-keys*cA". Following
    is a sample output:-

              "C-h" ......................... "backspace"
              "C-[" ......................... "esc"
              "C-[ [ 1 ~" ................... "delete"
              "C-[ [ 1 1 ~" ................. "f1"
              "C-[ [ 1 2 ~" ................. "f2"
              "C-[ [ 1 3 ~" ................. "f3"
              "C-[ [ 1 4 ~" ................. "f4"
              "C-[ [ B" ..................... "down"
              "C-[ [ 4 ~" ................... "end"
              "C-[ [ 2 ~" ................... "insert"
              "C-[ [ 3 ~" ................... "home"
              "C-[ [ D" ..................... "left"
              "C-[ [ 6 ~" ................... "page-down"
              "C-[ [ 5 ~" ................... "page-up"
              "C-[ [ C" ..................... "right"
              "C-[ [ A" ..................... "up"
              "C-[ [ V" ..................... "page-up"
              "C-[ [ U" ..................... "page-down"
              "C-m" ......................... "return"
              "C-i" ......................... "tab"
              "\x7F" ........................ "backspace"


cEFOREIGN KEYBOARDS  cA


    Foreign keyboards (non-US/UK) use a variety of key sequences, not
    recognized by MicroEmacs, to expand the keyboard character range to cope
    with accented characters. For example, on a German keyboard cCcGAltGr-mcAcA
    (recognized as cCcGA-C-mcAcA) is used to insert a Greek mu (or micro sign). On a
    Belgian keyboard cCcGAltGr-9cAcA inserts a '{' character.

    Many foreign keyboards are already directly supported by MicroEmacs and
    the keyboard specifics of a country have been understood and resolved. In
    these cases the cDKeyboardcA configuration in lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le may be used for
    the country location.

    If MicroEmacs does not support your keyboard, cDtranslate-keycA may be used to
    fix any key input problems. For the aforementioned examples the following
    cDtranslate-keycA commands would be required:

sB
          ; translate AltGr-m to a Greek mu (char 0xb5)
          translate-key "A-C-m" "\xB5"
          ; translate AltGr-9 to a '{'
          translate-key "A-C-9" "{"

sA
    The problem is complicated further on Microsoft Window's platforms by the
    simultaneous generation of 2 keys for some Alt-Gr key combinations (this
    is a side effect of endeavoring to capture all key combinations in this
    environment). For the Belgian keyboard example, on Win32 platforms an
    cCcGAltGr-9cAcA generates an cCcGA-C-9cAcA key first followed immediately by an
    cCcGA-C-{cAcA. As both keys are generated in quick succession this is unexpected
    and confusing.

    When the key is first pressed on a poorly configured system the error
    "cC[Key not bound "A-C-{"]cA" is given even when using the command
    lsdescribe-key(2)lmdescribe-key(2)le as the key described will be 'A-C-9' and then the 'A-C-{'
    key is generated and interpreted creating the error message.

    The variable ls$recent-keys(5)lm$recent-keys(5)le can be used to diagnose this problem and to
    obtain the 2 keys generated; alternatively use the macro below:

sB
          define-macro report-2-keys
              ml-write "Press key 1"
              set-variable #l0 @cgk
              ml-write "Press key 2"
              set-variable #l1 @cgk
              ml-write &spr "[The following keys where pressed: \"%s\" \"%s\"]" #l0 #l1
          !emacro

sA
    When executed the user is prompted for the first key; press the required
    key sequence (in this case cCcGAltGr-9cAcA), if you are not prompted for the
    second key and the result is immediately returned then the key you pressed
    has generated 2 keys, both of which will be given in the print out, i.e.:

       "[The following keys where pressed: "A-C-9" "A-C-{"]"


    The translate-key required to fix this type of problem would be:

sB
          translate-key "A-C-9 A-C-{" "{"

sA
    If your keyboard is not directly supported by MicroEmacs, please submit
    the keyboard name and platform with a working translate-key configuration
    to lsMicroEmacs - Contact InformationlmJASSPAle as a cDBUGcA.


cEUNIX TERMCAP  cA


    cDtranslate-keycA may also be used to interpret non-standard key sequences for
    UNIX termcap platforms to standard MicroEmacs keys. Non-standard keys,
    such as the cursor keys, have system dependent key sequences. The output
    from these keys usually take the form:

       `^[[X` or `^[[DX` or `^[[DDX` or `^[[DDD`

    where cD^[cA is the escape key (27), cDDcA is a digit and cDXcA is any character.
    These keys may be bound to the standard keys, for example the typical
    output of the cursor keys may be translated as follows:-

       `^[[A` = __up__, `^[[B` = __down__, `^[[C` = __right__ and `^[[D` = __left__

    The "cCfromcA" string is specified as this key sequence and the "cCtocA" string is
    simply the key it is to be bound to, see lsglobal-bind-key(2)lmglobal-bind-key(2)le for a guide to
    the string format. For the above example the following set of translations
    are required:-

sB
          translate-key "esc [ A" "up"
          translate-key "esc [ B" "down"
          translate-key "esc [ C" "right"
          translate-key "esc [ D" "left"

sA
    Note that MicroEmacs interprets cG\ecA as an escape key. More obscure keys
    tend to be very platform specific, following are some examples:

sB
          translate-key "esc [ 2 ~" "insert"
          translate-key "esc [ 5 ~" "page-up"
          translate-key "esc [ 5 ^" "C-page-up"

sA

cEEXAMPLE cA


    Using the positive numeric argument it is possible to reduce the delay and
    there by increase usability is some features. For instance, in the Mouse
    configuration of cDuser-setupcA there is an option to 'Simulate 3 Buttons'
    which translates a rapid left and right button press into a middle button
    press. This is implemented using cDtranslate-keycA as follows:

sB
          10 translate-key "mouse-pick-1 mouse-pick-3" "mouse-pick-2"
          10 translate-key "mouse-pick-3 mouse-pick-1" "mouse-pick-2"
          10 translate-key "mouse-drop-1 mouse-drop-3" "mouse-drop-2"
          10 translate-key "mouse-drop-3 mouse-drop-1" "mouse-drop-2"

sA
    When a cGmouse-pick-1cA key is generated MicroEmacs must wait to see if a
    cGmouse-pick-3cA key is next and therefore translate both to a single
    cGmouse-pick-2cA key. This wait time is usually a quarter of a second but this
    makes the left button unusable for dragging regions etc as the delay is
    too long. By giving a argument of 10ms the delay is long enough for a
    simultaneous left and right button press but short enough for the left
    button to still be usable on its own.

    The positive numeric argument can be very useful for delaying MicroEmacs
    as well, for example, the character string cGcG'ecAcA can be converted to
    e-accute using lsexpand-iso-accents(3)lmexpand-iso-accents(3)le. This could be performed
    automatically using translate-key as follows:

sB
          1000 translate-key "' e" "\xE9"

sA
    The larger 1 second delay give the user enough time to type the cCcGecAcA after
    the 'cG'cA' character.

cENOTES cA


    The concept of standardized key-bindings is very important for cross
    platform use and maintenance.

    Refer to lsglobal-bind-key(2)lmglobal-bind-key(2)le for a list of standard bindings.

    One of the easiest ways of obtaining a key sequence is to run cDsh(1)cA which
    does not attempt to interpret these keys so when a key is pressed
    (followed by cG<RETURN>cA) the following type of error message is usually
    generated:-

       sh: ^[[2~:  not found.


    where cG^[[2~cA is the required key sequence. Another method of obtaining
    these key sequences is to start MicroEmacs 2009, use lsstart-kbd-macro(2)lmstart-kbd-macro(2)le to
    start a macro definition, press the required keys and then use
    lsend-kbd-macro(2)lmend-kbd-macro(2)le followed by lsname-kbd-macro(2)lmname-kbd-macro(2)le and lsinsert-macro(2)lminsert-macro(2)le to
    display the keys pressed.

    The key sequences generated for these keys are dependent on the machine
    displaying MicroEmacs 2009 as opposed to the machine running it. Often
    they are the same machine, but when they are not there is no easy method
    of determining the displaying machine and therefore correctly configuring
    MicroEmacs 2009.

    A better way of obtaining this cross platform consistency is to create an
    XTerm app-defaults setup file with the correct VT100 key translations,
    e.g. the setup file could contain the following


       *vt100.translations: #override \
           Shift<Key>Tab:  string("\033[Z") \n\
           <Key>BackSpace:  string("\177") \n\
           <Key>Delete:  string("\033[1~") \n\
           <Key>Insert:  string("\033[2~") \n\
           <Key>Home:  string("\033[3~") \n\
           <Key>End:  string("\033[4~") \n\
           <Key>Prior:  string("\033[5~") \n\
           <Key>Next:  string("\033[6~") \n\
           Ctrl<Key>Up:  string("\033Oa") \n\
           Ctrl<Key>Down:  string("\033Ob") \n\
           Ctrl<Key>Right:  string("\033Oc") \n\
           Ctrl<Key>Left:  string("\033Od") \n\
           Shift<Key>Up:  string("\033[a") \n\
           Shift<Key>Down:  string("\033[b") \n\
           Shift<Key>Right: string("\033[c") \n\
           Shift<Key>Left:  string("\033[d") \n


    By using the environment variable cCXUSERFILESEARCHPATHcA to ensure that this
    configuration file is found instead of the system one (found in
    cG/usr/lib/X11/app-defaultscA), the key sequences will then be the same across
    all platforms. See manual page on cDxterm(1)cA for more information.

$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDset-char-maskcA "cCflagscA" ["cCvaluecA"]


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDset-char-maskcA returns or modifies the setting of MicroEmacs internal
    character tables. The argument cCncA defines the action to be taken, as
    follows:-

    cD-1cA
 
       Removes characters from the given set.

    cD0cA
 
       Returns characters in the given set in ls$result(5)lm$result(5)le.

    cD1cA
 
       Adds characters to the given set.

    The first argument "cCflagscA" determines the required character set as
    follows:-

    cDdcA
 
       Is Displayable. Characters in this set can be directly displayed to
       the screen (as a single character) when occurring in a buffer. When a
       character not in this set is to be displayed it is performed using
       more than one character. Characters in the range 1-31 are displayed as
       cGcG^?cAcA where cG?cA is the ASCII character plus 64, (e.g. 0x01 -> 65, i.e.
       cGcG^AcAcA) otherwise the character is displayed in the form cGcG\xhhcAcA where cGhhcA
       is the hex form of the ASCII value. One notable exception is the tab
       character (0x09), by default this character is not displayable,
       instead it is displayed as a sequence of one or more spaces up to the
       next tab stop.

    cDpcA
 
       Is Pokable. Similar to cDdcA, characters in this set can be poked to the
       screen when using lsscreen-poke(2)lmscreen-poke(2)le. When found in a binary file the
       character is displayed in the right hand column. Unlike cDdcA, any
       character outside this set will be displayed as a single period cCcG.cAcA,
       indicating that it cannot be displayed.

    cDPcA
 
       Is Printable. Similar to cDdcA, characters in this set may be printed as a
       single character when using lsprint-buffer(2)lmprint-buffer(2)le or lsprint-region(2)lmprint-region(2)le. Any
       character not in this set is printed in a similar fashion to cDdcA.

    cDMcA
 
       Character font Map. Internally MicroEmacs uses ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) to
       configure alphabetic classes and the spell-checker, however the system
       font being used by the native platform may not be the same, for
       example a small 'e' acute is character 0xe9 in ISO-8859-1 but
       character 0x82 in Windows OEM fonts. To change the characteristics of
       the 'e' acute character (such as making it an alphabetic character),
       the ISO-8859-1 character should always be used, but a correct mapping
       of ISO-8859-1 to the display font (such as Windows OEM) must also be
       supplied.

       Unlike other sets, this set cannot be incrementally altered, any calls
       to alter this set leads to the resetting of all the character tables
       so the character mapping must be performed first and in a single call.
       No other set may be altered in the same call. When setting, the
       "cCvaluecA" must supply pairs of characters, an ISO-8859-1 character
       followed by its system font equivalent.

    cDLcA
 
       ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) character map list. This set cannot be altered
       using this flag, character mappings must be set up using flag cDMcA. The
       order of the characters in the returned cD$resultcA string is the same as
       the order for flag cDUcA.

    cDUcA
 
       User font character map list. This set cannot be altered using this
       flag, character mappings must be set up using flag cDMcA. The order of the
       characters in cD$resultcA when returned is the same as the order for flag
       cDLcA.

    cDacA
 
       Is Alphabetic letter. Characters in this set are alphabetical
       characters, used by many MicroEmacs commands such as lsforward-word(2)lmforward-word(2)le.
       When setting, the "cCvaluecA" must specify pairs of ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1)
       characters, an Upper-case character followed by its lower-case
       equivalent. This enables commands such as lslower-case-word(2)lmlower-case-word(2)le to
       operate correctly regardless of the font and language being used. Some
       fonts may not have all the characters available for rendering, for
       instance PC Code page 437 does not have an upper-case 'e' grave. In
       this case an ordinary 'E' should be used as a sensible replacement,
       i.e. "E`e" (where `e is an 'e' grave). However, this will lead to all
       upper-case 'E's to map to a lower-case 'e' grave in a case changing
       operation, this may be corrected by adding a further mapping of 'E' to
       'e' to over-ride the 'e' grave mapping, i.e. "E`eEe". This technique
       does fail when changing the case more than once, when all lower case
       'e' graves will be lost.

       Note that the returned character list will pair all lower-case
       characters with their upper-case equivalent letters first.

    cDlcA
 
       Is Lower case letter. This set cannot be altered using this flag,
       alterations to the alphabetic set must be performed using flag cDacA.
       Characters in this set are all the lower-case letters, typically the
       characters cCcGacAcA to cCcGzcAcA. The order may not be the same as returned by
       flag cDucA.

    cDucA
 
       Is Upper case letter. This set cannot be altered using this flag,
       alterations to the alphabetic set must be performed using flag cDacA.
       Characters in this set are all the upper-case letters, typically the
       characters cCcGAcAcA to cCcGZcAcA. The order may not be the same as returned by

    cDhcA
 
       Is Hex-decimal Digit. The set is rarely used as it is invariably the
       digits cCcG0cAcA to cCcG9cAcA and the letters cCcGacAcA to cCcGfcAcA in upper and lower case.
       It is often used in the setting of ls$buffer-mask(5)lm$buffer-mask(5)le.

    cDAcA
 
       Is Alpha-numeric. This set cannot be altered using this flag,
       alterations to the alphabetic set must be performed using flag cDacA.
       Characters in this set are either alphabetic characters or the digits
       0-9.

    cDscA
 
       Is Spell extended word character. The characters in this set are
       recognized by the spell checker as characters which may be considered
       part of a word, for example the period cCcG.cAcAs in e.g. or the hyphen cCcG-cAcA
       in hyphenated-words. Typically this set contains the characters 'cG'cA',
       cCcG-cAcA and cCcG.cAcA.

    cD1cA, cD2cA, cD3cA & cD4cA
 
       Is in Word. These user definable sets are used to add characters to a
       buffer's word character set, affecting the operation of commands like
       lsforward-word(2)lmforward-word(2)le. Many different file types operate better with a
       different word character set, e.g. it is preferable to include the cCcG_cAcA
       character when editing C files. See variable ls$buffer-mask(5)lm$buffer-mask(5)le.

    cDkcA
 
       Keyboard character map. This flag is used to configure a mapping from
       a foreign non-latin keyboard (such as Russian) to Latin characters,
       setting the mapping correctly can greatly improve usability in
       MicroEmacs as changing keyboards is required less frequently. The
       mapping is used by character input routines which first check the main
       key typed (e.g. the Cyrillic character) and if not bound or invalid
       MicroEmacs uses this keyboard mapping to translate the character into
       a Latin character. This allows the user to execute binding such as
       cG`C-x k`cA or responding to cGcG[y/n]cAcA prompts without having to change
       keyboards.

       As with flag cDMcA, this cannot be incrementally altered, any call to set
       this mapping first resets the mapping table so the mapping must be
       performed in a single call. No other set may be altered in the same
       call. When setting, the "cCvaluecA" must supply pairs of characters, the
       ISO-8859 non-latin character followed by its latin character mapping.

    Unless stated otherwise, multiple flags may be specified at the same time
    returning a combined character set or setting multiple properties for the
    given "cCvaluecA" characters.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    For many UNIX XTerm fonts the best characters to use for ls$box-chars(5)lm$box-chars(5)le
    (used in drawing lsosd(2)lmosd(2)le dialogs) lie in the range 0x0B to 0x19. For
    example the vertical bar is cCcG\x19cAcA, the top left hand corner is cCcG\x0DcAcA
    etc. These characters are by default set to be not displayable or pokable
    which renders them useless. They can be made displayable and pokable as
    follows:-

sB
          set-char-mask "dp" "\x19\x0D\x0C\x0E\x0B\x18\x15\x0F\x16\x17\x12"

sA
    MicroEmacs variables have either cCcG$cAcA, cCcG#cAcA, cCcG%cAcA, cCcG:cAcA or a cCcG.cAcA character
    prepended to their name, they may also contain a cCcG-cAcA character in the body
    of their name. It is preferable for these characters to be part of the
    variable 'word' so commands like lsforward-kill-word(2)lmforward-kill-word(2)le can work correctly.
    This may be achieved by adding these characters to user set cD2cA and setting
    the cDbuffer-maskcA variable to include set cD2cA, as follows:

sB
          set-char-mask "2" "$#%:.-"

          define-macro fhook-emf
              set-variable $buffer-mask "luh2"
              .
              .
          !emacro

sA
    For the examples below only the following subset of characters will be
    used:-

       Character               ISO-8859-1    Windows OEM    PC Page 437

       Capital A (A)           A             A              A
       Capital A grave (`A)    \xC0          \xB7           No equivalent
       Capital A acute ('A)    \xC1          \x90           No equivalent
       Small a (a)             a             a              a
       Small A grave (`a)      \xE0          \x85           \x85
       Small A acute ('a)      \xE1          \xA0           \xA0


    As the spell checker only operates in ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1), the character
    font mapping (flag cDMcA) must be correctly setup for spell checking to
    operate correctly. For ISO-8859-1 (ISO) this is an empty string as the
    default mapping is correct, but for both Windows OEM (OEM) and PC Code
    Page 437 (PC-437) the mappings should be set as follows:-

sB
          ; OEM font mapping setup
          set-char-mask "M" "\xC0\xB7\xC1\x90\xE0\x85\xE1\xA0"
          ; PC-437 font mapping setup
          set-char-mask "M" "\xC0A\xC1AAA\xE0\x85\xE1\xA0"

sA
    As all the characters in ISO have equivalents in OEM, the mapping for OEM
    is a simple ISO to OEM character list. However the missing capital cDAcA's in
    PC-437 cause problems, for the command lscharset-iso-to-user(3)lmcharset-iso-to-user(3)le it is
    preferable for a mapping of cD`AcA to be given, otherwise the document being
    converted may remain unreadable. Therefore a mapping of cD`AcA to cDAcA is given
    to alleviate this problem, similarly cD'AcA is also mapped to cDAcA.

    This leads to a similar problem with the conversion of PC-437 back to ISO
    (the operation of command lscharset-user-to-iso(3)lmcharset-user-to-iso(3)le). If only the mapping of
    cGcG\xC0A\xC1AcAcA was given, the last mapping (cD'AcA to cDAcA) would also be the back
    conversion for cDAcA, i.e. ALL cDAcA's would be converted back to cD'AcA's. To solve
    this problem, a further seemingly pointless mapping of cDAcA to cDAcA is given to
    correct the back conversion.

    For languages which use these characters, the alphabetic character set
    must be extended to include these characters for letter based commands
    like lsforward-word(2)lmforward-word(2)le and lsupper-case-word(2)lmupper-case-word(2)le to operate correctly. The
    addition of extra letters must achieve two goals, firstly to define
    whether a character is a letter, enabling commands like cDforward-wordcA to
    work correctly. The second is to provide an upper case to lower case
    character mapping, enabling commands like cDupper-case-wordcA to work
    correctly. This is achieved with a single call to cDset-char-maskcA using the
    cDacA flag as follows:-

sB
          set-char-mask "a" "\xC0\xE0\xC1\xE1"

sA
    Note that this flag always expects a ISO-8859-1 character, this allows the
    same map character list to be used regardless of the font set being used,
    i.e. the above line can be used for ISO, OEM and PC-437 fonts. But it does
    mean that the ISO to user font character mapping (flag cDMcA) must already
    have been performed.

    Similar problems are encountered with the cDMcA flag with font PC-437. This
    problem is not immediately obvious because the mapping is given in ISO,
    but when this is converted to PC-437, the mapping string becomes
    cGcGA\x85A\xA0cAcA. As can be seen, cDAcA is mapped last to cD'acA so an upper to lower
    character operation will convert a cDAcA to cD'acA. A similar solution is used, a
    further mapping of cDAcA to cDacA is given to correct the default case mapping for
    both cDAcA and cDacA, i.e. the following line should always be used instead:-

sB
          set-char-mask "a" "\xC0\xE0\xC1\xE1Aa"

    cDtranspose-charscA (cDC-tcA)  
    cCncA cDtranspose-linescA (cDC-x C-tcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDtranspose-charscA exchanges (swaps) the current character under the cursor
    with the previous character. cDtranspose-characterscA does not operate in
    column 0 (since there is no previous character). If the cursor is at the
    end of a line when the command is initiated then the cursor is moved to
    the previous character and the operation performed from the new position.

    cDtranspose-linescA swaps the next line for the current line and moves to the
    next line, effectively retaining the same text position. Repeating this cCncA
    times moves the current line cCncA lines down.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    cDtranspose-charactercA performs the following operations (cursor at cD^cA):-

       abcde  => acbde         [Middle of line]
            ^         ^

    cDundocA removes the last cCncA edits made to the current buffer. The lsundo(2m)lmundo(2m)le
    buffer mode must be enabled for this command to operate.

    The undo information is retained up until the next save operation, at
    which point the undo information is discarded. When editing large files
    with gross changes then it is advisable to either disable undo mode, or
    save frequently to flush the undo buffer, thereby keeping MicroEmacs 2009
    memory requirements reasonable (most UNIX users have restrictions on the
    amount of memory that may be consumed by a single process. Windows is
    restricted by the amount of virtual memory (or swap space)).

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDuniversal-argumentcA (cDC-ucA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDuniversal-argumentcA sets the argument number passed to a command to 4^cCncA (4
    to the power of cCncA) where cCncA is the number of calls to cDuniversal-argumentcA,
    e.g. the key sequence cGcGC-uC-ncAcA moves down 4 lines, cGcGC-uC-uC-uC-ncAcA moves
    down 4*4*4 = 64 lines.

    After invoking the cDuniversal-commandcA a 'cC-cA' character can be pressed to
    negate the argument value, and an alternative numeric argument can be
    entered using the 'cC0cA' to 'cC9cA' keys.

    Invoking this command via lsexecute-named-command(2)lmexecute-named-command(2)le or by a macro has no
    effect. The command should be treated as a command key prefix (like
    lsprefix(2)lmprefix(2)le) in that it may be bound to only one key sequence which must be
    a single key stroke. Re-binding this command to another key unbinds the
    new key and also the current cDuniversal-argumentcA key.

    The cDprefix 1cA key (by default bound to cGesccA) may also be used to enter a
    numeric argument at the message line, e.g. cG`esc 1 0 C-f`cA will move forward

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDadd-spell-rulecA [ "cCrule-lettercA" "cCbase-endingcA" "cCremovecA" "cCderive-endingcA" ]


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDadd-spell-rulecA adds a new spelling rule to the speller. The rules
    effectively define the prefix and suffix character replacements of words,
    which is given an alphabetical identifier used within the speller , in
    conjunction with the language dictionary. The letter conventions are
    defined by the cDFree Software FoundationcA GNU cDispell(1)cA package.

    cDadd-spell-rulecA is used in the MicroEmacs 2009 dictionary initialization
    files called cC<language>cAr.emf, e.g. cGamericar.erfcA, cGbritishr.erfcA supplied in
    the MicroEmacs macros directory.

    The command takes a single numeric argument cCncA to control the addition of a
    rule to the speller, as follows:-

    cG0cA cDadd-spell-rulecA
 
       Removes all existing rules and re-initializes. This is, by convention,
       explicitly called before instantiating a new set of rules.

    cG-1cA cDadd-spell-rulecA "cCrule-lettercA" "cCbase-endingcA" "" "cCderiv-endingcA"

    cG-2cA cDadd-spell-rulecA "cCrule-lettercA" "cCbase-endingcA" "" "cCderiv-endingcA"

       Adds a prefix rule, an argument of -1 indicates that this prefix rule
       cannot be used with a suffix rule. An argument of -2 indicates it can
       be matched with any suffix rule which can be used with a prefix rule
       (e.g. argument of 2).

       "cCrule-lettercA" is any character in the range cGAcA-cGzcA except cCcG_cAcA, all rules
       of the given letter must be a prefix rule of the same type (i.e. same
       argument). The start of a base word must match the given "cCbase-endingcA"
       regular expression string for the rule to be applied, the "cCremovecA"
       string must be empty for a prefix and the "cCderiv-endingcA" is the prefix
       string. Example, for the American language;-

           `-2 add-spell-rule "I" "" "" "in"` ; As in disposed > indisposed

       A prefix rule of type cCcGIcAcA can be applied to any base word which has
       rule cCcGIcAcA enabled, and it prefixes cGcGincAcA to the word.

 cG1cA cDadd-spell-rulecA "cCrule-lettercA" "cCbase-endingcA" "cCremovecA" "cCderiv-endingcA"

 cG2cA cDadd-spell-rulecA "cCrule-lettercA" "cCbase-endingcA" "cCremovecA" "cCderiv-endingcA"
 
       Add suffix rules. An argument of 1 indicates that this prefix rule
       cannot be used with a prefix rule. An argument of 2 indicates it can
       be matched with any prefix rule which can be used with a suffix rule
       (i.e. argument of -2).

       "cCrule-lettercA" is any character in the range cGAcA-cGzcA, all rules of the
       given letter must be a suffix rule of the same type (i.e. same
       argument). The end of a base word must match the given "cCbase-endingcA"
       regular expression string for the rule to be applied, the "cCremovecA"
       string must be a fixed string and the "cCderiv-endingcA" must also be a
       fixed string which is appended to the base-word after "cCremovecA" has
       been removed. Example, for the American language;-

sB
              2 add-spell-rule "N" "e" "e" "ion"     ; As in create > creation
              2 add-spell-rule "N" "y" "y" "ication" ; As in multiply > multiplication
              2 add-spell-rule "N" "[^ey]" "" "en"   ; As in fall > fallen

sA
       A suffix rule of type cCcGNcAcA can be applied to any base word which has
       rule cCcGNcAcA enabled, and it can be used with prefixes, e.g. with rule;-

sB
              -2 add-spell-rule "A" "" "" "re"       ; As in enter > reenter

sA
       to derive "cCrecreationcA" from "cCcreatecA". A rule which cannot be used with
       prefixes, i.e.:

sB
              1 add-spell-rule "V" "e" "e" "ive"     ; As in create > creative
              1 add-spell-rule "V" "[^e]" "" "ive"   ; As in prevent > preventive

sA
       While some prefix words are legal, such as "cCrecreativecA" but some are
       not, such as "cCcollectcA" where "cCrecollectcA" is correct, so is
       "cCcollectivecA" but "cCrecollectivecA" is not.


cESPECIAL RULES  cA


    Following are special forms of add-spell-rule used for tuning the spell
    support, note that an argument can not be given:-

    cDadd-spell-rulecA "cC-cA" "<cCycA|cCncA>"

       Enables and disables the acceptance of hyphens joining correct words.
       By default the phrase cGcGout-of-datecAcA would be accepted in American even
       though the phrase does not exist in the American dictionary. This is
       because the three words making up the phrase are correct and by
       default hyphens joining words are allowed. Some Latin language such as
       Spanish do not use this concept so this feature can be disable.

    cDadd-spell-rulecA "cC#cA" "cCscorecA"

       Sets the maximum allowed error score when creating a spelling guess
       list. When comparing a dictionary word with the user supplied word,
       cDspellcA checks for differences, each difference or error is scored in
       the range of 20 to 27 points, once the maximum allowed score has been
       exceeded the word is ignored. The default guess error score is 60,
       allowing for 2 errors.

    cDadd-spell-rulecA "cC*cA" "cCregexcA"

       Adds a correct word in the form of a lsRegularExpressions(2)lmregexle if a word being spell
       checked is completely matched by the cDregexcA the word is deemed to be
       correct. For example, the following rule can be used to make the
       spell-checker allow all hex numbers:

sB
          add-spell-rule "*" "0[xX][[:xdigit:]]+"

sA
    This will completely match the words cGcG0x0cAcA, cGcG0xffcAcA etc but not cGcG0x00zcAcA as
    the whole word is not matched, only the first 4 letters.


cENOTES cA


    The format of the dictionary is a list of base words with each word having
    a list of rules which can be applied to that word. Therefore the list of
    words and the rules used for them are linked e.g.

       aback
       abaft
       abandon/DGRS
       abandonment/S
       abase/DGRS
       abasement/S
       abash/DGS
       abashed/U
       abate/DGRS


    where the cGcG/...cAcA is the valid list of rules for that word.

    The '_' character is used to separate different rule lists for a single
    word.

    The format of the dictionary word list and the rule list is compatible
    with cDispell(1)cA.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDscreen-updatecA (cDredrawcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDscreen-updatecA updates the current screen, usually used in macros. The
    argument cCncA can be used to change the behaviour of this command as follows:

    cCnegative ncA
    
       Disables the next -cCncA screen updates, i.e. if cCncA is cG-1cA then the next
       time the screen needs to be redrawn nothing will happen.

    cG0cA
 
       Resets the screen update disable count to zero, useful to remember
       when the the disable feature has been used incorrectly.

    cG1cA
 
       Full screen update (default), the screen is completely cleared and
       redrawn (as if garbled).

    cG2cA
 
       Partial screen update, only the parts of the screen which require
       updating are redrawn.

    cG3cA
 
       No screen redraw, only window variables are up-dated. This feature is
       provided for macros which manipulate the screen view and need to know
       where the cursor is in the window without redrawing the screen (which
       may cause unwanted flickering). Note that as the screen is not redrawn
       not all variables may have the correct value, for example the frame
       store variable ls@fs(4)lm@fs(4)le could be out of date.

    use screen variables in macros after the current position has changed. The
    first value printed is the starting cursor Y position and the next value
    should be one less than the first value due to the call to
    lsbackward-line(2)lmbackward-line(2)le. But it is the same as the first because the screen (and
    its variables) have not been updated. The subsequent call to screen-update
    ensures that the third value is the correct one although by giving it an
    argument of 3 the screen is not visibly updated thus avoiding any annoying
    screen flicker:

sB
          define-macro test-screen-update
              set-variable #l0 $cursor-y
              backward-line
              set-variable #l1 $cursor-y
              3 screen-update
              set-variable #l2 $cursor-y
              forward-line
              ml-write &spr "%d %d %d" #l0 #l1 #l2
          !emacro

cENOTES cA


    Every time the screen requires updating, MicroEmacs executes the cCredrawcA
    key, it is similar in mechanism to the user pressing cCC-lcA to refresh the
    screen. The user can therefore re-bind the cCredrawcA key to another command
    or macro, thereby allowing the user complete control of what is displayed.
    For example if cCredrawcA was bound to lsvoid(2)lmvoid(2)le the screen would not be
    up-dated (cDNotecA: this is difficult to get out of and may require MicroEmacs
    to be killed).

    This feature is often exploited by macros which take control of the input
    and output, such macros include lsgdiff(3)lmgdiff(3)le, lsMetris(3)lmMetris(3)le, and lsMahjongg(3)lmMahjongg(3)le.

! 2 view-file
cEcENAME cEcA


    view-file - Load a file read only
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDview-filecA "cCfile-namecA" (cDC-x C-vcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDview-filecA is like lsfind-file(2)lmfind-file(2)le, and either finds the file in a buffer, or
    creates a new buffer and reads the file in. A new file is left in lsview(2m)lmview(2m)le
    mode if the file was found (i.e. cannot be edited).

    The numeric argument cCncA can be used to modify the default behaviour of the
    command, where the bits are defined as follows:

    cD0x01cA
    
       If the file does not exist and this bit is not set the command fails
       at this point. If the file does not exist and this bit is set (or no
       argument is specified as the default argument is cG1cA) then a new empty
       buffer is created with the given file name, saving the buffer
       subsequently creates a new file.

    cD0x02cA
    
       If this bit is set the file will be loaded with lsbinary(2m)lmbinary(2m)le mode
       enabled. See help on cDbinarycA mode for more information on editing
       binary data files.

    cD0x04cA
    
       If this bit is set the file will be loaded with lscrypt(2m)lmcrypt(2m)le mode
       enabled. See help on cDcryptcA mode for more information on editing
       encrypted files.

    cD0x08cA
    
       If this bit is set the file will be loaded with lsrbin(2m)lmrbin(2m)le mode enabled.
       See help on cDrbincA mode for more information on efficient editing of
       binary data files.

    cD0x10cA
    
       If this bit is set then the file hook evaluation is not performed when
       the file is loaded (i.e. the lsfileHooks(2)lmbuffer's file hookle is not executed).

cEcENAME cEcA


    write-buffer - Write contents of buffer to named (new) file
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDwrite-buffercA "cCfile-namecA" (cDC-x C-wcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDwrite-buffercA is used to write the contents of the buffer to a NEW file,
    use lssave-buffer(2)lmsave-buffer(2)le if the buffer is to be written to the existing file
    already associated with the buffer.

    cDwrite-buffercA writes the contents of the current buffer to the named file
    cCfile-namecA. The action of the write also changes the file name associated
    with the current buffer to the new file name.

    Unlike lsappend-buffer(2)lmappend-buffer(2)le, cDwrite-buffercA always replaces an existing file and
    the new file inherits the buffers file characteristics instead of the old
    file's.

    On writing the file, if lstime(2m)lmtime(2m)le mode is enabled then the ls$timestamp(5)lmtime staple
    is searched for in the file and modified if located, to reflect the
    modification date and time.

    If the buffer contains a lsnarrow(2m)lmnarrow(2m)le it will automatically be removed
    before saving so that the whole buffer is saved and restored when saving
    is complete

    If lsbackup(2m)lmbackup(2m)le mode is enabled and the buffer is associated with a
    different file (compared with cCfile-namecA) then any ls$auto-time(5)lmautomatic savele copies of
    the file associated with the cCbuffercA are deleted.

    The argument cCncA may be used to change the default behavior of write-buffer
    described above, cCncA is a bit based flag where:-

    cD0x01cA
    
       Enables validity checks (default). These include a check that the
       proposed file does not already exist, if so confirmation of writing is
       requested from the user. Also MicroEmacs 2009 checks all other current
       buffers for one with the proposed file name, if found, again
       confirmation is requested. Without this flag the command will always
       succeed wherever possible.

    cD0x02cA
    
       Disables the expansion of any narrows (see lsnarrow-buffer(2)lmnarrow-buffer(2)le) before
       saving the buffer.

! 2 ml-write
cEcENAME cEcA


    ml-write - Write message on message line
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cC0cA cDml-writecA  
    cCncA cDml-writecA "cCmessagecA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDml-writecA writes the argument "cCmessagecA" to the message line. If a positive
    numeric argument cCncA is specified then the message is displayed with a cCncA
    milliseconds uninterruptible delay allowing the user time to see the
    message.

    The arguments to cDml-writecA are defined as follows:-

    cCNo argumentcA
    
       The default form, writes a cCmessagecA to the command line with no delay.

    cC+vecA

        Displays the cCmessagecA on the message line and waits cCncA milliseconds
       before proceeding with the next command.

    cG0cA
 
       the cCmessagecA argument is not required and the command clears the
       message line. This may be used to clear any previous message from the
       last command(s) in a script and is equivalent to the old MicroEmacs
       command cDml-clearcA.

    cG-1cA
    
       Writes the cCmessagecA to cCstandard outcA. A carriage return (cG'\n'cA) is
       automatically added to the end of the cCmessagecA to create a line on the
       given stream.

    cG-2cA
    
       Writes the cCmessagecA to cCstandard errorcA, the behaviour is the same as
       standard output (cG-1cA option)


cENOTES cA


    If the argument value is not cG-1cA or cG-2cA calls to cDml-writecA are ignored in
    standard MicroEmacs piped mode (command-line option cD-pcA). They are printed
    to cCstandard errorcA when debug piped mode is used (command-line option cD-PcA,
    see lsme(1)lmme(1)le), making the debugging and maintenance of macro based piped
    processing easier.

    In previous releases the command cDml-clearcA was used to clear the message
    line, this command was replaced by cG0 ml-writecA in December 2004.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following call displays a message on the message-line with a 2 second
    pause:

sB
          2000 ml-write "Hello World!"

sA
    The following lsstart-up(3)lmstart-up(3)le macro may be used to add a header and footer
    line to a file piped to cCstandard incA, writing the output to cCstandard outcA.

sB
          define-macro start-up
              find-buffer "*stdin*"
              ml-write &spr "DEBUG: Read %d lines from stdin" $window-eline
              ml-write &spr "DEBUG: About to write header"
              -1 ml-write "<<<HEADER>>>"
              ml-write &spr "DEBUG: About to write body"
              0 save-buffer
              ml-write &spr "DEBUG: About to write footer"
              -1 ml-write "<<<FOOTER>>>"
              -2 ml-write &spr "%d lines written to stdout" &add $window-eline 2
              quick-exit
          !emacro

    To run this example save this macro in a new macro file (such as
    cGmlwrite_test.emfcA) and in a shell run:

       cat input_file | me -n -p @mlwrite_test - > output_file

! 2 yank
cEcENAME cEcA


    yank - Paste (copy) kill buffer contents into buffer
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDyankcA (cDC-ycA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    When a non negative argument is supplied to cDyankcA, the command copies the
    contents of the kill buffer cCncA times into the current buffer at the current
    cursor position. This does not clear the kill buffer, and therefore may be
    used to make multiple copies of a section of text. On windowing systems
    which support clip-boards, such as windows and X-terms, MicroEmacs will
    also cut to and paste from the global clip-board.

    If cCyankcA is IMMEDIATELY followed by a lsreyank(2)lmreyank(2)le then the cCyankedcA text is
    replaced by text of the next entry in the kill ring. (another cDreyankcA
    replaces the text with the previous reyank text and so on).

    If an negative argument is given, cDyankcA removes the last 0-cCncA items from the
    kill ring.

    Text is inserted into the kill buffer by one of the following commands:-

    lsbackward-kill-word(2)lmbackward-kill-word(2)le, lscopy-region(2)lmcopy-region(2)le, lsforward-kill-word(2)lmforward-kill-word(2)le,
    lskill-line(2)lmkill-line(2)le, lskill-paragraph(2)lmkill-paragraph(2)le, lskill-region(2)lmkill-region(2)le,
    lsforward-delete-char(2)lmforward-delete-char(2)le, lsbackward-delete-char(2)lmbackward-delete-char(2)le.

    All the above commands (except cDcopy-regioncA) cut text out of the buffer,
    the last two character delete commands require the presence of a numeric
    argument to add the deleted text to the kill buffer. If any of these
    commands are executed immediately after any other (including itself) or
    the ls@cl(4)lm@cl(4)le variable is set to one of these command, the new kill text is
    appended to the last kill buffer text.


cENOTES cA


    Windowing systems such as X-Windows and Microsoft Windows utilize a global
    windowing kill buffer allowing data to be moved between windowing
    applications (cCcut buffercA and cCclipboardcA, respectively). Within these
    environments MicroEmacs 2009 automatically interacts with the windowing
    systems kill buffer, the last MicroEmacs 2009 kill buffer entry is
    immediately available for a cCpastecA operation into another application
    (regardless of how it was inserted into the kill buffer). Conversely, data
    placed in the windowing kill buffer is available to MicroEmacs 2009, via
    cDyankcA, until a new item has been inserted into the kill buffer (the data
    may still be available via lsreyank(2)lmreyank(2)le).


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example is a basic macro code implementation of the
    lstranspose-lines(2)lmtranspose-lines(2)le command,

sB
          beginning-of-line
          kill-line
          forward-line
          yank
          -1 yank
          backward-line

sA
    Note that similar to cDtranspose-linescA it does not leave the moved line in
    the kill buffer, effectively tidying up after itself.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDdefine-macro-filecA "cCfile-namecA" ["_macro-name_" "cCmacro2-namecA" ...]


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    Macros are loaded as late as possible using an on-demand mechanism, this
    speeds up the load time of MicroEmacs 2009, it also keeps the startup file
    clean since macros are not defined within the start-up file. Only when the
    user first executes a macro defined via cDdefine-macro-filecA is the file
    loaded, the macro becomes defined and is executed. Subsequent calls to the
    macro will not reload the file as the macro will now be fully defined.

    cDdefine-macro-filecA binds macros (cCmacro-namecA ...) to a file name
    (cCfile-namecA). This operation informs MicroEmacs 2009 which file should be
    loaded when cCmacro-namecA is first executed. The cCmacro-namecA arguments may be
    omitted if the file contains only one exported macro which has the same
    name as cCfile-namecA.

    Alternatively the macro file may contain many macros all of which can be
    defined by a single call to cDdefine-macro-filecA, listing all macros on the
    same line after the cCfile-namecA. If a cCmacro-namecA is given then the default
    macro cCfile-namecA is not created, if a macro of that name does exist it must
    be added to the cCmacro-namecA list.

    cDscroll-leftcA moves the window in current buffer left by 1 screen width. If
    an argument cCncA is supplied then the resolution of movement is specified in
    characters relative to the current displacement. Moving the window in the
    current buffer left by cCncA characters (that is if the current left-hand
    margin of the screen is column 0, the left hand margin becomes column cCncA).

    cDscroll-rightcA moves the window in current buffer right by 1 screen width.
    If an argument cCncA is supplied then the resolution of movement is specified
    in characters relative to the current displacement.

    The ends of the lines of a scrolled screen are delimited with a dollar (cD$cA)
    character indicating that the text continues. When no scroll is in effect
    the left hand margin of the screen does not show the cD$cA symbol. i.e. The
    line cGThis text is scrolled on this linecA with a current scroll offset of 2
    in a 22 column window would appear as follows:

                   22
       |<------------------->|

       |$s text is scrolled $|


    The amount of scroll (cCncA) is effectively unlimited, it is possible to
    scroll all of the text in a buffer out of the window, when only cD$cA's appear
    in the left margin, in the last highlighting color of the line (blank
    lines always remain blank and are not delimited with a cD$cA). Text on the
    current line is handled according to the value of ls$scroll(5)lm$scroll(5)le as follows:

    cD$scroll 0cA
    
       The current line ONLY is scrolled (about the current scroll position)
       to enable the current buffers cursor position to be viewed. To enable
       the user to determine where the current line is in relation to the
       scrolled lines then the first character of the current line is
       interpreted as follows:-

       cDAll of user text appearscA

              |$f line of te$|
              |At start of l$|
              |$f line of te$|


             Surrounding lines commence with "$" indicates at the start of the
              line.

        cD$ in column 0cA

              |$f line of te$|
              |$f line of te$|
              |$f line of te$|


             Text column is the same as the surrounding text i.e. the line and
              window scroll are the same.

        cD> Left of scroll positioncA

              |$f line of te$|
              |>f line of te$|
              |$f line of te$|


              The current line is to the left of the scrolled position.
              lsforward-char(2)lmforward-charle (i.e. interpret as --> indicating the direction of
              travel) moves the cursor, and therefore the line, towards the
              natural scroll position ($ in column).

       __< Right of scroll position__

              |$f line of te$|
              |<f line of te$|
              |$f line of te$|


     >        The current line is to the right of the scrolled position.
              [backward-char](forward-char(2)) (i.e. interpret as <-- indicating the direction of
              travel) moves the cursor, and therefore the line, towards the
              natural scroll position ($ in column).

    cD$scroll 1cA
    
       The position of the cursor on the line determines the scrolled
       position. In this case all lines in the window are scrolled to ensure
       that the cursor is always visible. This mode is only useful when
       dealing with large blocks of text whose line lengths do not vary.


cENOTES cA


    The scrolling is an attribute of the WINDOW and not the BUFFER. If the
    window is closed, or contents swapped to a different buffer then the
    scroll setting is reset for the next buffer. A return to the previous
    buffer does not restore the scroll setting. The only case where scrolling
    is inherited is when a window is split (see lssplit-window-vertically(2)lmsplit-window-vertically(2)le).

    When binding cDscroll-leftcA to the keyboard then it is important to note that
    when no argument is specified the resolution is cCframe-widthcA's. A key
    binding would operate on character multiples, hence the command should be
    bound with a numeric argument to perform the perform the keyboard action.
    e.g.

sB
          1 global-bind-key scroll-left  "A-left"
          1 global-bind-key scroll-right "A-right"

sA
    To move 5 columns on a key stroke, for an accelerated scroll, then the
    binding may be re-written as:-

sB
          5 global-bind-key scroll-left  "A-left"
          5 global-bind-key scroll-right "A-right"

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDsave-some-bufferscA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDsave-some-bufferscA cycles through all visible buffers (buffers without mode
    lshide(2m)lmhide(2m)le set) and attempts to save all modified ones, writing the contents
    back to the file from where it was read. For each buffer that has been
    modified the user is prompted to save the buffer, the following responses
    can be given:

    cDycA
    
       Saves the buffer and moves to the next modified buffer.

    cDncA
    
       Does not save the buffer and moves to the next modified buffer. cDacA
       Saves all remaining modified buffers including the current one without
       further prompting. cDocA Skips all remaining buffers including the current
       one. cDgcA Display the buffer and aborts the command.

    The argument cCncA can be used to change the default behavior of
    save-some-buffers described above, cCncA is a bit based flag where:-

    cD0x01cA

    mark-registry - Modify the operating mode of a registry node


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDmark-registrycA "cCrootcA" "cCmodecA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDmark-registrycA modifies the cCmodecA of a registry node cCrootcA. If an argument cCncA
    is supplied then the cCncAth register node down from cDrootcA (as viewed from
    lslist-registry(2)lmlist-registry(2)le output) is modified instead. The mode is string
    specifying the modes, each mode is represented by a character. Lower case
    characters add a mode, upper case characters delete a mode. The modes are
    defined as:-

    cD?cA - Query Name
    
       Returns the full name, including path, of the given registry node in
       the variable ls$result(5)lm$result(5)le. This does not alter the registry.

    cD!cA - Hide Value
    
       Hides the value of the given registry node, i.e. the node is displayed
       but its value will not be displayed in the output of lslist-registry(2)lmlist-registry(2)le.
       Once set, this mode cannot be removed.

    cDacA - Autosave
    
       Automatically saves the registry when it is deleted or unloaded from
       the registry. The user is not prompted for a save.

    cDbcA - Backup
    
       Automatically performs a backup of the registry file whenever a save
       operation is performed.

    cDccA - Create
    
       If the registry file cannot be loaded then the cCrootcA node is created
       and the invocation succeeds. If this mode is omitted then the call
       fails if the cCfilecA cannot be found.

    cDdcA - Discard
    
       Marks the registry as discardable. This is typically used for
       registries that are not saved.

    cDfcA - File
    
       The registry node is marked as a file root, the value must be set to
       the registry file name.

    cDgcA - Get Modes
    
       Returns the list of modes currently set on the given registry node in
       the variable ls$result(5)lm$result(5)le. This does not alter the registry.

    cDhcA - Hierarchy Hidden
    
       The registry node is marked as cCHiddencA, i.e. its children will not be
       shown in lslist-registry(2)lmlist-registry(2)le output. A node is marked has hidden when it
       is folded up.

    cDicA - Invisible
    
       The registry node is not displayed in the lslist-registry(2)lmlist-registry(2)le output.

    cDmcA - Merge
    
       Marks the registry to enable merging, see lsread-registry(2)lmread-registry(2)le.

    cDrcA - Reload
    
       Marks the registry to enable reload, see lsread-registry(2)lmread-registry(2)le.

    cDucA - Updated
    
       Marks the registry as modified. The modified bit is removed when the
       registry file is saved. If the modified bit is applied to a registry
       node the user will be prompted to save the registry when it is deleted
       (or it will be automatically saved when the cCAutosavecA mode is used).

    cDycA - Encryption
    
       Marks the registry node for encryption. The value of the registry node
       is encrypted using the internal encryption algorithm. The value will
       not appear in plain text when using lssave-registry(2)lmsave-registry(2)le. This is
       typically used for password information etc.

    Multiple modes may be applied.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    A history registry can be hidden with the following invocation:-

sB
          mark-registry "/history" "h"

sA    It could then be made visible again using:-
sB

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDdelete-some-bufferscA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDdelete-some-bufferscA cycles through all visible buffers (buffers without
    mode lshide(2m)lmhide(2m)le set) and prompts the user [cDycA/cDncA] as to whether the buffer
    should be deleted. A cDycA response deletes the buffer, a cDncA response retains
    the buffer.

    If a cDycA response is given, the buffer has been edited, and its name does
    not start with a 'cCcC*cAcA' then the user is prompted as to whether the changes
    should be discarded. Also if the buffer has an active process running in
    it then confirmation is sort from the user before the process is killed.

    The argument cCncA can be used to change the default behavior of
    delete-some-buffers described above, cCncA is a bit based flag where:-

    cD0x01cA
    
       Enables all checks (default). These include the initial y/n prompt on
       each buffer, the buffer has not been modified check, if so the user is
       prompted. Also if a process is running then user must confirm that the
       process can be killed. If this flag is not supplied then all visible
       buffers are killed without any user prompts (useful in macros).

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDread-registrycA "cCrootcA" "cCfilecA" "cCmodecA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDread-registrycA loads a registry file lserf(8)lmerf(8)le into the internal registry
    memory, where the information may be queried via the registry macro
    commands. The arguments are defined as follows:-

    cCrootcA
    
       The root node in the registry to into which the registry contents are
       attached. The root name is limited to 32 characters in length and is
       specified without a leading forward slash cCcG/cAcA. The node cCrootcA is
       created at the root of the registry.

    cCfilecA
    
       The name of the registry file lserf(8)lmerf(8)le to load. This may be an absolute,
       relative or a ls$search-path(5)lm$search-path(5)le specified file; typically it is located
       on ls$search-path(5)lm$search-pathle.

    cCmodecA
    
       The cCmodecA is string specifying the registry node loading and saving
       modes, each mode is represented by a character. Lower case characters
       add a mode, upper case characters delete a mode. The modes are defined
       as follows:-

       cDacA - Autosave

             Automatically saves the registry when it is deleted or unloaded
              from the registry. The user is not prompted for a save.

       cDbcA - Backup

             Automatically performs a backup of the registry file whenever a
              save operation is performed.

       cDccA - Create
     
             If the registry file cannot be loaded then the root node is
              created and the invocation succeeds. If this mode is omitted then
              the call fails if the file cannot be found.

       cDdcA - Discard
     
             Marks the registry as discardable. This is typically used for
              registries that are not saved.

       cDrcA - Reload
    
             If the registry node already exists then it is deleted and
              reloaded, see also the merge flag (m). By default, when both the r
              and m flags are omitted and the registry node already exists the
              read operation is not performed and the existing node is used.

       cDmcA - Merge
     
             The registry file is merged with the contents of any existing
              registry node. (i.e. the existing registry tree nodes are not
              deleted if they already exist). See also the reload flag (r).

       cDhcA - Hidden

             The registry node is created in the Hidden state. (i.e. children
              will not be shown in lslist-registry(2)lmlist-registry(2)le output). Refer to
              lsmark-registry(2)lmmark-registry(2)le for hiding modes.

       cDucA - Updated

             Marks the registry as modified. The modified bit is removed when
              the registry file is saved. If the modified bit is applied to a
              registry node the user will be prompted to save the registry when
              it is deleted (or it will be automatically saved when the Autosave
              mode is used).

       Multiple modes may be applied.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example is a typical call made from a macro using a registry
    file where the user may edit the registry file. In this case this a reload
    of the registry is forced to ensure that the most up-to-date contents are
    retrieved. Note that the name of the registry file is actually retrieved
    from the cChistorycA registry.

    file-op - File system operations command
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDfile-opcA [ ( [ "cCfrom-filecA" "cCto-filecA" ] ) |  
       ( ["_delete-file_"] ) | ( ["_dir-name_"] ) |
       ( [ "cCchmod-filecA" "cCmodecA" ] ) ]


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDfile-opcA can be used to perform numerous file system operations. The given
    argument cCncA must be used to determine the required operation, the value is
    a bit based flag denoting the operation as follows:

    cD0x010cA
    
       Log-off and close down the current ftp connect (not a file system
       operation but functionality was required and it had to go somewhere).

    cD0x020cA
    
       When this bit is set the command functionality is changed to
       delete-file, the single argument cCdelete-filecA is deleted. Note this can
       also delete a directory if the directory is empty.

    cD0x040cA
    
       When this bit is set the command functionality is changed to
       move-file, the specified cCfrom-filecA is moved to cCto-filecA.

    cD0x080cA
    
       When this bit is set the command functionality is changed to
       copy-file, the specified cCfrom-filecA is copied to cCto-filecA.

    cD0x100cA
    
       When this bit is set the command functionality is changed to making a
       new directory, the specified cCdir-namecA is the name of the new
       directory. A file or directory of the given name must not already
       exist.

    cD0x200cA
    
       When this bit is set the command functionality is changed to a change
       mode type of operation. cCchmod-filecA is the name of the file (or
       directory) to change and cCmodecA is the integer mode to apply. Note that
       the cCmodecA value is operating system specific. The file attributes may
       be retrieved with the ls&stat(4)lm&stat(4)le command.

    Only one operation can be performed per invocation. The following bits in
    the given argument cCncA can be used to effect the behaviour of these
    operations:

    cD0x01cA
    
       Enables validity checks, these include a check that the proposed file
       does not already exist, if so confirmation of writing is requested
       from the user. Also MicroEmacs checks all other current buffers for
       one with the proposed file name, if found, again confirmation is
       requested. Without this flag the command will always succeed wherever
       possible.

    cD0x02cA
    
       Creates a backup of any file about to be deleted or over-written. Set
       help on ls$buffer-backup(5)lm$buffer-backup(5)le for backup file-name generation.

    cD0x04cA
    
       When validity checks are enabled (see bit 0x01 above) and this bit is
       set, if a problem is found the command aborts rather than prompting
       the user. Also see the error return codes in the notes section below.

    cD0x80cA
    
       When this bit is set then the files time stamp is preserved.


cENOTES cA


    cDhttpcA files are not supported except as the source file when copying. cDftpcA
    files are fully supported with the restriction that the from and to files
    cannot both be url (http or ftp) files. The one exception to this is when
    moving a file on the same ftp site in which case ME will attempt to use an
    ftp rename command.

    The command is used by lsfile-browser(3)lmfile-browser(3)le and lsftp(3)lmftp(3)le which provides an easy
    to use interfaces for file manipulation.

    When the command fails an error code is returned in the ls$result(5)lm$result(5)le
    variable, which will be one of the following:

    cD0cA
    
       User aborted.

    cD1cA
    
       General error.

    cD2cA
    
       Failure due to a read error.

    cD3cA
    
       Failure due to a write error.

    cD4cA
    
       Failure due to a directory creation error.

    cD5cA
    
       Failure due to a file or directory deletion error.

    cD6cA
    
       Failure due to file write checks, i.e. file already exists etc.

    cD7cA
    
       Failure due to directory creation checks, i.e. the directory or file
       already exists.

    cD8cA
    
       Failure due to file delete checks, i.e. file is read only.

    cD9cA
    
       Failure due to source and destination files are URLs.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDkill-rectanglecA (cDesc C-wcA)  
    cCncA cDyank-rectanglecA (cDesc C-ycA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDkill-rectanglecA deletes a rectangle (or column) of text defined between the
    cursor and the lsset-mark(2)lmset-markle position. The text between the mark column and the
    cursor column is removed from every line between the mark line and the
    cursor line inclusive and copied to the kill buffer. The delete text may
    then be extracted from the kill buffer using lsyank(2)lmyank(2)le, cDyank-rectanglecA or
    lsyank-rectangle-overwrite(3)lmyank-rectangle-overwrite(3)le.

    The mark position may be ahead or behind the current cursor position. If
    the rectangle column boundary divides a tab character which spans multiple
    columns, the tab character is replaced with the equivalent number of
    spaces. Similarly if the boundary divides an unprintable character which
    is displayed using multiple characters (e.g. cCcG^AcAcA for character 0x01) then
    spaces are inserted before the character to move it to the right of the
    boundary.

    cDyank-rectanglecA inserts the current kill buffer (which may or may not have
    been generated using cDkill-rectanglecA) into the current buffer in a column
    fashion. That is to say that the first line of text in the kill buffer is
    inserted into the current line of text in the current buffer from the
    current cursor column, the cursor is then moved the the next line and
    placed at the same column. The process is then repeated for the second
    line of text in the kill buffer etc.

cEcENAME cEcA


    command-wait - Conditional wait command
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDcommand-waitcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    When a positive argument cCncA is given cDcommand-waitcA waits for cCncA milliseconds
    before returning, this wait cannot be interrupted. If a negative argument
    is given, cDcommand-waitcA waits for -cCncA milliseconds but the command will
    return if the user interrupts with any input activity (i.e. presses a
    key).

    When no argument or an argument of 0 is given cDcommand-waitcA waits until
    either the calling command's cD.waitcA command variable is undefined or it is
    set to false (cG0cA). When no argument is given events such as user input,
    screen updates etc. are still processed, this interface is best used when
    a main macro must wait and process input until an exit criteria has been
    met, the user input is best processed by setting the ls$buffer-input(5)lm$buffer-input(5)le
    variable to a second macro. The macro lsgdiff(3)lmgdiff(3)le uses this command in this
    way, also see a comprehensive example below.

    When no argument is given user input and screen update events are ignored,
    this is typically used when MicroEmacs is used in pipe mode, see option cD-pcA
    of lsme(1)lmme(1)le, see the example below.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following macro code will display a message on the screen for a fixed
    5 seconds:

sB
          16 screen-poke 10 10 0 "Hello World!"
          5000 command-wait

sA
    Similarly the following macro code will display a message for up to 5
    seconds or till the user presses a key:

sB
          16 screen-poke 10 10 0 "Hello World!"
          -5000 command-wait

sA
    The following example shows how command-wait can be used to run a system
    process making MicroEmacs wait until the process has completed before
    continuing, yet giving feedback from the process to the user and allowing
    the user to kill the launched process. The process run is a recursive
    directory listing which will take a long time and give a lot of feed back,
    to kill the process with a prompt use delete-buffer (bound to cC`C-x k`cA) or
    use abort-command (bound to 'cDC-gcA') to kill immediately:

cEcENAME cEcA


    create-frame - Create a new frame
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDcreate-framecA (cDC-x 5 1cA, cDC-x 5 2cA)


cEINTODUCTION cA


    A cDframecA in MicroEmacs is the screen canvas on which all of the windows are
    attached. MicroEmacs allows the creation of new frames, creating a new
    blank canvas, which may be populated with new windows. Frames may be
    swapped and the window layout for a given frame is preserved until the
    frame is displayed again. There are two types of frame:

    Internal
 
       An internal frame uses the same display window (or console) hiding any
       other frames. On creation, any existing frame is hidden and a new
       frame blank takes its place. Internal frames are supported on all
       platforms.

    External
 
       An external frame creates a new display window allowing both the
       original frame and new frame to be visible in different windows.
       External frames are only available on windowing platforms such as
       X-Windows and Microsoft Windows. External frames may include internal
       frames which are paged.

    This is shown in the following diagram:-

                   +-----------------+           +-----------------+
                   |                 +-+         |                 +-+
                   |                 | +-+       |                 | |
                   |                 | | |       |                 | |

                     +-+---------------+ |         +-----------------+
                       +-----------------+

                    Three Internal Frames        External Frame with
                                                 two internal frames


    The user may move to the next frame using lsnext-frame(2)lmnext-frame(2)le which swaps the
    current frame for the next frame. External frames may also be accessed via
    the window manager by selecting the window.

    A frame may be subsequently deleted with lsdelete-frame(2)lmdelete-frame(2)le.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDcreate-framecA creates a new frame for the current MicroEmacs session, the
    new frame is assigned a unique identity ls$frame-id(5)lm$frame-id(5)le which exists for the
    life of the frame.

    The numeric argument cCncA defines the type of frame to be created. An
    argument of cG2cA creates an external frame, an internal frame is created with
    an argument of cG1cA. Where no argument is specified an external frame is
    created by default on systems which support them otherwise an internal
    frame is created.


cENOTES cA


    MicroEmacs is not multi-threaded and only one frame may be active at any
    one time (the complexity of being able to run a command in one frame while
    editing in another would rapidly lead it away from the 'Micro' status).
    Therefore if a command is left active (such as a search) in one frame and
    the focus is changed to another frame the input is cCsentcA to the frame with
    the active command and the message cG[NOT FOCUS]cA appears in the message-line
    of the frame with the focus.

    cDcreate-framecA is useful in macros that rely on a window layout, as the
    macro can preserve the users current window layout by creating a new
    internal frame in which to run.

    cDnext-framecA changes the focus to the next frame. The numerical argument cCncA
    can be used to select the type of frame to change to, it is a bit based

    cD0x01cA
    
       Allow the selection of an internal frame.

    cD0x02cA
    
       Allow the selection of an external frame.

    The default operation when cCncA is omitted is to allow the selection of
    either type of frame, but an external frame is selected in preference.
    This is not the same as giving the command an argument of cG3cA where all
    frames are circled in creation order (i.e. no priority given to an

    JASSPA MicroEmacs is based on the original version of cDMicroEMACScA produced
    by Danial Lawrence at revision 3.8, the source files were obtained in
    approximately 1990. The exact origin of the files is unknown. In that
    period of time the source files have undergone an awful lot of change,
    without reference to the subsequent releases made of MicroEMACS by Danial
    Lawrence (due to no network access). As a result the JASSPA version of
    cDMicroEmacscA does not include any modifications or features that may have
    been implemented since. This version of cDMicroEmacscA has been tailored to
    suite the requirements of a small group of individuals who have used the
    editor on a daily basis across a limited number of platforms, for a
    variety of very different tasks and operating requirements.

    This version of MicroEmacs is biased towards UNIX environments, MS-DOS and
    Microsoft Windows ports have been performed however they are heavily
    influenced by UNIX and inherit UNIX characteristics wherever possible. The
    intention is that programmers, and alike, may move across platforms using
    a common editor environment without being frustrated by the idiosyncrasies
    of different platforms. The most noticeable platform is the Microsoft
    Windows platform which mimics the X-Windows cut and paste mechanism within
    the MicroEmacs environment. If you want a Windows style environment then
    use cDNotepad(1)cA or cDWordpad(1)cA, this editor is not for you !!

    The gross changes to cDMicroEmacs 2009cA are summarized as follows:-

    - Macro language interpreter re-written allowing an unlimited number
     of named macros to be supported. The macro implementation allows new
     commands to be created by the user, as opposed to continually
     extending the underlying command set. The named macros are
     transparent to the user, appearing as built in commands on the
     command line. Macro command set significantly increased. Support for
     global, buffer and register variables within the macro language.

    - Display drivers re-written providing color hilighting support on
     most platforms. A macro interface allows information to be written
     directly to the display canvas allowing the screen to be annotated
     with additional transient information.

    - Support for X-Window screen type in UNIX environments. Microsoft
     Window's environments (3.x, '95, NT) treated in the same was as
     X-Windows - this may be unorthodox for existing Window's users, UNIX
     users will find it more comfortable.

    - Introduction of integrated spell checker. Support includes
     correction word guessing, word auto-correction and double word
     detection. Ignore and personal dictionaries supported.

    - Horizontal window splitting.

    - Introduction of scroll bars on all platforms that support a mouse.
     The scroll bar implementation is platform independent.

    - Command and file completion available on all platforms. Most
     commands support a command history allowing previous command
     invocations to be recalled.

    - Session history file kept, allowing the previous edit session to be
     reinstated.

    - Undo capability, allows previous edits to be undone when mistakes
     are made.

    - Backup capability, Includes a periodic timed backup while an editing
     session is in progress. The timed backup is automatically recovered
     by the next session in situations where the system (or editor)
     crashes.

    - A regular expression incremental search becomes the default search
     forward mechanism.

    - Support for abbreviation files allowing frequently used constructs

! 2 fileHooks
cEcEFILE HOOKS cEcA


    File hooks provide a mechanism to automatically invoke a set of macros for
    a given buffer type when the following events occur:

    - Loading of a file into a buffer
    - Moving into a buffer (i.e. making a buffer current)
    - Moving out of a buffer (i.e. making another buffer current)
    - Deleting an active buffer

    The file hook selection (see below) is performed on the file name /
    extension and on the textual content of the buffer using lsadd-file-hook(2)lmadd-file-hookle.

    Refer to lslanguageTemplates(2)lmLanguage Templatesle for a description of how the file hooks are
    used to define a new template for a new text format.

    The hook macros allow buffer modes and highlighting, applicable to the
    text type of the file, to be applied to the buffer. In addition, the
    associated hook macros may be located in a separate file and are loaded on
    demand when the file reading determines that a set of hook macros are
    required.

    Consider a file hook definition of the form;

sB
          add-file-hook ".c .h" "fhook-c"

sA
    which binds the file hook cDfhook-ccA to any files that are loaded with the
    extension cD.ccA and cD.hcA. The operations undertaken by MicroEmacs 2009 are
    defined as follows when a file cGfoo.ccA is loaded:-

    - Attempt to load file cGfoo.ccA, if cGfoo.ccA is not found then create a new
          buffer and assign file name foo.c.

    - If cGfoo.ccA is found then load file into buffer. Search the first
          line(s) of the buffer for magic hook text (add-file-hook with
          argument).

    - If magic hook was not found then determine hook name from the file
          extension (add-file-hook information).

    - If a hook command is located, assign the file hook cDfhook-ccA to the
          buffer, assign the buffer entry (begin) hook macro of bhook-c;
          assign a buffer exit hook of ehook-c.

    - If the macro cDfhook-ccA is undefined then execute the macro file
          hkc.emf from the MicroEmacs home directory in an attempt to load the
          macro. If the file myc.emf is defined, then the modifications to the
          language template are applied after hkc.emf is loaded.

    - If the macro cDfhook-ccA is (now) defined then cGfoo.ccA is TEMPORARILY made
          the current buffer and the file hook macro fhook-c is executed to
          completion and the previous current buffer is restored. [TEMPORARY
          here implies that no buffer hooks are executed on the flip in/out of
          foo.c].

    - The current buffer is officially swapped to cGfoo.ccA. At this point the
          ehook of the old current buffer is executed (while its still
          current) and then foo.c is swapped in to become the current buffer;
          the begin buffer hook bhook-cmode is then executed for foo.c (if it
          exists).

    - If the user moves to another buffer execute the end hook macro
          ehook-cmode (if it exists) and move to the new buffer, executing
          it's begin hook.

    - If the user subsequently returns to buffer cGfoo.ccA execute the
          previous buffers end hook macro, set the current buffer to foo.c and
          execute the begin hook macro bhook-c (if it exists).

    - If the user kills buffer cGfoo.ccA, if cGfoo.ccA is the current buffer then
          an alternative buffer is made current, ehook and bhook executed as
          normal. If macro dhook-c is defined then foo.c is TEMPORARILY made
          the current buffer and the delete hook macro dhook-c is executed to
          completion and the previous current buffer is restored.

    The name of the file hook macro name is important, hook commands must
    commence with the text cDfhook-modecA where cCmodecA is an identifier for the
    operating mode. The name space is decomposed as follows:-

    - The initial cDfcA is removed and replaced with cDbcA for the begin hook
          macro and e for the end hook macro.

    - When the cDfhookcA macro is undefined the cCmodecA component is removed and
          the file hkmode.emf is executed from the MicroEmacs home directory
          in an attempt to define the macro.

    The cDfhook-cA nomenclature may be omitted provided that the name is less than
    6 characters, however the file, begin and end hook macros MUST commence
    with cDfcA, cDbcA and cDecA respectively. In addition the macros must be defined as no
    auto file loading is performed.


cEBuffer Hook Variables  cA


    The macros bound to a buffer may be interrogated, the variables
    ls$buffer-fhook(5)lm$buffer-fhook(5)le, ls$buffer-bhook(5)lm$buffer-bhook(5)le, ls$buffer-ehook(5)lm$buffer-ehook(5)le and ls$buffer-dhook(5)lm$buffer-dhook(5)le
    contain the names of any associated macro attached as a macro hooks,
    defining the cCfilecA, cCbegincA, cCendcA and cCdeletecA hooks respectively. If a macro is
    not bound then the empty string cG""cA is returned. Setting the variables has
    the effect of defining the hook and is a method by which the buffer hooks
    may be affected after the buffer has been loaded.


cEDetermination of a new file  cA


    The cCfilecA hook cDfhook-XXXcA numeric argument may be used to determine if the
    file associated with a buffer is a new file created by the user, or an
    existing file. Typically this distinction is used to determine whether a
    boiler template is added to the file or not. The macro argument cD@#cA is
    defined as zero (0) if this is a new file that has been created, or
    non-zero otherwise.

    The macro argument status is typically tested on entry to the macro as
    follows:-

sB
          define-macro fhook-mode
              !if &not @#
                  ; This is a new file. Do new file things
              !else
                  ; This is an existing file
              !endif
              ; Set up bindings
          !emacro

sA
    An example of a generic cDhookcA file is given at the end of this section
    which elaborates on the file hooks.


cEBegin and End hooks  cA


    The cCbegincA and cCendcA hooks are usually used to save and restore global states
    which require special settings for a particular buffer type. This
    typically involves saving and restoring global variables which are used by
    other buffers in a different configuration. For example the following is
    used to reformat the time stamp string; the time stamp is a global
    variable ls$timestamp(5)lm$timestamp(5)le and if it is changed in one buffer, it must be
    restored ready for another. In this case the old time stamp is retained in
    a local buffer variable whenever the buffer is entered, the time stamp is
    then modified for the buffers requirements. On exit from the buffer the
    old time stamp format is restored to it's former state.

sB
          0 define-macro bhook-foo
              set-variable .timestamp $timestamp      ; Save old time stamp.
              set-variable $timestamp "19%Y/%M/%D %h:%m:%s"
          !emacro

          0 define-macro ehook-foo
              set-variable $timestamp .bhook-foo.timestamp
          !emacro

sA
    Note that in both cases the lsdefine-macro(2)lmdefine-macro(2)le invocation is defined as zero,
    this merely hides the macro from the command line since both are private
    macros not normally invoked by the user.


cEFILE HOOK SELECTION cA


    MicroEmacs 2009 may be reconfigured to operate in different modes
    (referred to a cCMajor ModescA in GNU cDemacs(1)cA) using the lsadd-file-hook(2)lmmacro file hooksle.
    The file hooks allow the working environment to be customized for the
    editing of text of a particular sort, by importing text specific macros,
    key rebinding and highlighting.

    MicroEmacs 2009, by default, loads a file into a buffer with default
    global modes with no highlighting. There are no mode specific key
    bindings, variable settings, macros or highlights, buffer interaction
    behaves in it's default state. The state of the buffer interaction may be
    modified through the use of the buffer modes (see lsOperating Modes)lmOperating Modesle, for
    example the 'C' programming language automatic indent lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le changes
    the characteristics of the cGtabcA character and performs language specific
    indentation of statements. When a text specific set of highlighting rules
    are applied to the buffer, the text becomes emphasized through the use of
    color applied selectively to the text i.e. comments, keywords, strings are
    shown in different colors, allowing them to be differentiated without
    studying the content.

    Setting the operating mode of the buffer would be tedious to perform from
    the command line, instead MicroEmacs 2009 uses three different prioritized
    criteria to endeavor to select the correct operating mode. The operating
    mode is applied to the buffer by execution of a set of file specific
    macros, referred to a hook commands. The selection criteria of the hook
    commands is performed as follows, ordered in lowest to highest priority:-

    cDFile NamecA
    
       MicroEmacs 2009 uses the filename and/or the file extension to select
       a start-up hook command. File names and extensions are bound to a set
       of macro hooks in a space separated list e.g.

       >  [add-file-hook](add-file-hook(2)) "c cpp" "fhook-cmode"  
          [add-file-hook](add-file-hook(2)) "doc txt README" "fhook-doc"

       The space separated list of names are interpreted as either file
       extensions or filenames. In this case any file with the extension cD.ccA,
       cD.cppcA is bound to a file hook called cDfhook-cmodecA e.g. cGfoo.ccA. Similarly
       files with the extension cD.doccA or cD.txtcA are interpreted as plain text
       documents and are bound to cDfhook-doccA. e.g. cGfoo.txtcA. The entry cDREADMEcA
       that exists in the documentation hook list may refer to a file cGREADMEcA
       and also cGfoo.READMEcA, both cases invoke the document hook.

       The file selection is the lowest priority selection criteria but
       usually satisfies most mode selection requirements.

    cDMagic StringscA
    
       There are cases when file extensions may be omitted from files,
       typically these files include an identifier, or magic string, on the
       first line of the file which is used to identify the file to the
       operating system or application e.g. shell scripts under UNIX.
       MicroEmacs 2009 automatically interrogates the top of every file that
       is loaded to locate some form of identification string. The
       identification strings are defined in a similar way to the file name
       hooks, except instead of defining a file extension the location and
       text content of the identifier is defined:

       >  1 [add-file-hook](add-file-hook(2)) "#!/bin/sh" "fhook-shell"  
          1 [add-file-hook](add-file-hook(2)) "#!/usr/local/bin/wish" "fhook-tcl"

       In this case, any file that commences with "cD#!/bin/shcA" is interpreted
       as a shell script and invokes the shell hook cDfhook-shellcA. Where the
       identifier does not appear on the first non-blank line, the argument
       may be increased to the number of lines to be searched. Also it the
       magic sting should be search for without lsexact(2m)lmexact(2m)le mode then the
       argument should be negated, e.g.

          -4 add-file-hook "<html>" "fhook-html"

       invokes cDfhook-htmlcA whenever cGcG<html>cAcA, cGcG<HTML>cAcA etc. is found in the
       first 4 lines of a file header, e.g.:

              <!-- Comment line -->
              <HtMl>


       A match on a string identifier is assigned a higher priority than the
       file extension. It is recommended that magic strings are only used
       where there are no predefined file extensions, or conflicts exist
       between files with the same extension containing data interpreted in a
       different context.

    cDExplicit StringscA

       The last method allows an explicit identifier string to be embedded
       into the text of the file informing MicroEmacs 2009 which mode it
       should adopt. GNU Emacs supports this (see cDMajor ModecA in the GNU Emacs
       documentation) type of operation by insertion of strings of the form:

              -*- mode -*-

       Where cCmodecA represents the major mode within GNU Emacs. The same format
       as used by cDMagic StringscA can be used to find and extract the cCmodecA,
       e.g.:

              -1 [add-file-hook](add-file-hook(2)) "-[*!]-[ \t]nroff.*-[*!]-" "fhook-nroff"

       The definition would detect the GNU Emacs mode defined in an Nroff
       file e.g.

              .\" -*- nroff -*- "
              .TH man 1
              .SH NAME
              ...

       It should be stressed that the cD-*-cA syntax belongs to GNU Emacs and NOT
       MicroEmacs 2009, MicroEmacs 2009 provides a mechanism to locate,
       extract and interpret the string. The cD-*-cA syntax should only be
       applied to files if it is known that the cCmodecA is a GNU mode.

       A MicroEmacs 2009 specific string is also provided, defined as:

              -!- mode -!-

       where cCmodecA is an arbitrary string defined by cCadd-file-hookcA. User
       defined modes may be created and assigned to files with this syntax,
       this does not conflict with the GNU Emacs command. For example to
       assign a new mode cCmymodecA to a file we would define the following:-

              -1 [add-file-hook](add-file-hook(2)) "-!-[ \t]mymode.*-!-" "fhook-mymode"

       Files containing a the following identifier would be loaded with
       cCmymodecA hook:

              # -!- mymode -!-
              #
              # Last Modified:  <120683.1014>


cEFILE HOOK SCRIPTS cA


    The buffer hook files cDhkXXX.emfcA typically follow a standard layout, and
    are generally associated with hi-lighting as follows, cDmodecA in this case is
    the name of the file mode associated with the file:-

sB
          !if &seq .hilight.mode "ERROR"
              set-variable .hilight.mode &pinc .hilight.next 1
          !endif
          ;
          ; Define the hilighting
          ;
          0 hilight .hilight.mode 1                $global-scheme
          hilight .hilight.mode 2 "\*\*"           .scheme.comment
          hilight .hilight.mode 4 "\"" "\"" "\\"   .scheme.string

              1 buffer-mode "indent"
              buffer-abbrev-file "mode"
          !emacro

sA
    The previous example shows how the cDfhook-modecA numeric argument is used to
    determine if this is a new file. If the argument cD@#cA is zero then this is
    interpreted as a new file, in this case a standard template is inserted
    (from file cDmode.etfcA) and the generic strings such as cG$YEAR$cA replaced with
    construction information. The template is generally used for standard
    headers and skeleton text body.

    In addition an abbreviation file cDmode.eafcA (see lseaf(8)lmeaf(8)le) is bound to the
    buffer using the lsbuffer-abbrev-file(2)lmbuffer-abbrev-file(2)le command and the buffer hi-lighting
    enabled by assignment of the ls$buffer-hilight(5)lm$buffer-hilight(5)le variable.


cEMODIFYING FILE HOOKS cA


    The standard hook files supplied with MicroEmacs 2009 should not be
    modified, changes to the file hooks may be applied using a separate macro
    file called cDmyXXX.emfcA, this is automatically executed after the cDhkXXX.emfcA
    file is executed.

    The extended hook functions may be defined company wide, or by the user,
    to over-ride some of the standard hook functions, or to extend the syntax
    of the base files with locally defined extensions. As an example, consider
    the following file cDmyc.emfcA which extends the basic cDhkc.emfcA file set of
    hi-lighting tokens for the 'C' Language.

! 2 keyNames
cEcEKEY BINDING NAMES cEcA


    Every key which can be generated in MicroEmacs 2009 has a character string
    or name representation which can be used to bind and unbind the key to a
    command. The name of simple keys like cGcGacAcA or cGcG$cAcA is simply the character,
    i.e. cGcGacAcA and cGcG$cAcA. Following is a list of other parts to a key name.


cEModify Keys  cA


    There are 3 modifying keys, Shift, Control and Alt, these are represented
    as cGcGS-cAcA, cGcGC-cAcA, cGcGA-cAcA respectively. For example the key cGcGA-C-S-upcAcA is
    generated when the up cursor key is pressed when Shift, Control and Alt
    keys where also pressed.

    The Control and Alt modifiers are case insensitive so cGC-acA is the same as
    cGC-AcA and cGC-S-acA.


cEPrefix Keys  cA


    Many binding are single stroke key sequences (e.g. cGcGC-acAcA =>
    beginning-of-line). However MicroEmacs 2009 has a lsprefix(2)lmprefix(2)le command which
    can be used to bind up to 8 single stroke keys, turning them into two
    stroke keys; this greatly increasing the number of available bindable key
    sequences. For example cDprefix 1cA is bound to the escape character (cGesccA),
    this allows key sequences like cG`esc a`cA to be used. Following is a list of
    prefixes and their default bindings

    - lsprefix(2)lmprefix 1le => esc
    - lsprefix(2)lmprefix 2le => C-x
    - lsprefix(2)lmprefix 3le => C-h
    - lsprefix(2)lmprefix 4le => C-c


cESpecial Keys  cA


    Following is a complete list of recognized keyboard key names, not all are
    able to be generated on every platform:-

       `backspace`, `delete`, `down`, `end`, `esc`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`, `f5`, `f6`, `f7`, `f8`, `f9`,
       `f10`, `f11`, `f12`, `f13`, `f14`, `f15`, `f16`, `f17`, `f18`, `f19`, `f20`, `home`, `insert`,
       `kp-0`, `kp-1`, `kp-2`, `kp-3`, `kp-4`, `kp-5`, `kp-6`, `kp-7`, `kp-8`, `kp-9`, `kp-add`,
       `kp-begin`, `kp-decimal`, `kp-delete`, `kp-divide`, `kp-down`, `kp-end`, `kp-enter`,
       `kp-home`, `kp-insert`, `kp-left`, `kp-multiply`, `kp-page-down`, `kp-page-up`,
       `kp-right`, `kp-subtract`, `kp-up`, `left`, `page-down`, `page-up`, `return`, `right`,
       `space`, `tab`, `up`

    The name of any key can be obtained by using lsdescribe-key(2)lmdescribe-key(2)le.


cEMouse Keys  cA


    Following is a list of mouse related keys:-

    cDmouse-pick-1cA, cDmouse-pick-2cA, cDmouse-pick-3cA, cDmouse-pick-4cA, cDmouse-pick-5cA

       These keys are generated when the user presses a mouse button, these
       key events are always created. On most systems button 1 is the left, 2
       the middle and 3 the right mouse button. If the system only has a 2
       button mouse then a cGmouse-pick-2cA cannot be generated. The order of the
       buttons can be revered (i.e. 1 becomes right) and the number of
       buttons can be set using the ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le variable. Note that X-servers
       support up to 5 buttons and with the growing popularity of pilot
       'wheel' mice, the 4th and 5th button are often used to report wheel
       spin up and down events. The lstranslate-key(2)lmtranslate-key(2)le command can be used to
       translate these buttons to the mouse wheel keys.

    cDmouse-drop-1cA, cDmouse-drop-2cA, cDmouse-drop-3cA, cDmouse-drop-4cA, cDmouse-drop-5cA

       These keys are generated when the user release a mouse button, these
       key events are always created.

    cDmouse-move-1cA, cDmouse-move-2cA, cDmouse-move-3cA, cDmouse-move-4cA, cDmouse-move-5cA,
 
    cDmouse-movecA

       These key events are generated when the user moves the mouse and are
       only if they are bound to a command. The key generated depends on
       whether a button is being held down by the user, if the user is
       pressing button 1 then a cGmouse-move-1cA key is created etc.

    cDmouse-time-1cA, cDmouse-time-2cA, cDmouse-time-3cA, cDmouse-time-5cA, cDmouse-time-5cA,

    cDmouse-timecA

       These key events are generated only when they are bound to a command.
       They are pseudo keys created when the user hold the mouse buttons done
       for a period of time, see cDPseudo KeyscA below for more information.

    cDmouse-wheel-upcA, cDmouse-wheel-downcA

       Pilot mouse wheel events, generated when the wheel is spun up or down
       respectively.


cEModifier Keys  cA


    The Shift, Control and Alt modifier keys will also generate key input
    whenever pressed or released. The keys are however only generated if they
    are bound to a command. The key names are as follows:

    cDS-pickcA, cDS-dropcA

       Shift modifier.

    cDC-pickcA, cDC-dropcA

       Control modifier.

    cDA-pickcA, cDA-dropcA

       Alt modifier.

    Note that the keys are only generated when another key is pressed, i.e. if
    the user presses and holds only the shift key, no cGcGS-pickcAcA key will be
    generated until another key, such as cGdowncA, is also pressed. If the shift
    key is released before another key is pressed the event will not be
    reported.


cEPseudo Keys  cA


    Pseudo keys events cannot be directly created by the user, they are
    created internally by MicroEmacs. They are treated like normal keys to
    allow the user to handle the events properly themselves. Following is a
    complete list of the system generated pseudo keys:-

    cDbellcA

       The pseudo key is generated when the bell is rung.

    cDcallbackcA

       The pseudo key when a lscreate-callback(2)lmcreate-callback(2)le macro is executed, this
       allows the executed macro to know it was executed via a
       create-callback as ls@cck(4)lm@cck(4)le will be set to this.

    cDidle-pickcA, cDidle-dropcA, cDidle-timecA

       The commands bound to these keys are executed when the system becomes
       idle for a period of time. See help on ls$idle-time(5)lm$idle-time(5)le for more
       information.

    cDmouse-time-1cA, cDmouse-time-2cA, cDmouse-time-3cA, cDmouse-time-4cA, cDmouse-time-5cA,  
    cDmouse-timecA
    
       The command bound to these keys are executed when mouse button 1, 2,
       3, 4, 5 or a combination are held bound for a period of time. See help
       on ls$delay-time(5)lm$delay-time(5)le for more information.

    cDredrawcA

       The command bound to this pseudo key is executed whenever the screen
       needs redrawing, by default it is bound to lsscreen-update(2)lmscreen-update(2)le. If the
       user unbinds this key then cDscreen-updatecA is still called, but if the
       user binds it to a function which does not redraw the screen, such as
       lsvoid(2)lmvoid(2)le, then the screen will not be up-dated.

    The command executed is always given an argument, a non-zero argument
    indicates a forced complete redraw, an argument of zero indicates that
    just an up-date is required.


cEAlt Key  cA


    The cDAlt KeycA has special binding priorities defined as follows:-

    - Direct key binding (e.g. cDA-bcA executes lsfile-browser(3)lmfile-browserle)
    - Main menu hot key (e.g. cDA-fcA opens the File menu)
    - Meta key binding (e.g. cDA-spacecA -> cDesc spacecA -> lsset-mark(2)lmset-markle)

    If the cGALTcA key is to be used strictly as the Emacs Meta key then the
    bindings for the menu should be over-ridden by cCDirect Key BindingscA from
    the user configuration file i.e. to re-map the default MicroEmacs Alt key
    to equivalent cGesccA keys then the following keys should be re-bound.

sB
          global-bind-key forward-word "A-f"    ; Over-ride File menu binding
          :                                     ; for all of the other menu items.
          :
          global-bind-key backward-word "A-b"   ; Over-ride the file browser.
          global-bind-key replace-string "A-r"  ; Over-ride tools binding.

sA
    This creates a higher priority binding which overrides the underlying
    default. The commands that are displaced would have to be re-bound to
    different keys if required.


cEKEYBOARD MACROS cA


    Keyboard macros do not store the name of keys, instead a more machine
    oriented format is used (usually in the form cGcG\s??cAcA) these will work
    across platforms (assuming the key bindings are the same) but they may not
    work across different releases.

    As a result it is advised that any long term macro should avoid named keys
    like cGupcA in favor of using a standard key binding such as cGC-pcA. See help on
    lsexecute-string(2)lmexecute-string(2)le for more information.
! 2mauto
cEcENAME cEcA


    auto - Automatic source file line type detection


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDauto ModecA

    cDAcA - mode line letter.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    When this mode is enabled the line style of the source file, with respect
    to cGCR/LF/CTRL-ZcA characters, are automatically detected and the file (if
    saved) is written out in the same style as it was read in. This mode is
    designed to solve the problems of MS-DOS which utilize a 'cD\r\ncA' with every
    new line and a cDctrl-ZcA as a file terminator, conversely UNIX utilizes only
    'cD\ncA' as a line terminator.

    cDautocA mode therefore allows files to be edited across file system types
    without corrupting the line style of the native platform.

    At load time, if cDautocA detects CR/LF style line feeds then it enables the
    buffer modes lscr(2m)lmcr(2m)le and lslf(2m)lmlf(2m)le; if a CTRL-Z is found at the end of the
    file then mode lsctrlz(2m)lmctrlz(2m)le is enabled. Otherwise these modes are cleared.

    At write time, if cDautocA mode is enabled then the file is written out is a
    style determined by modes cDcrcA, cDlfcA and cDctrlzcA. For example, if cDcrcA and cDlfcA were
    enabled and cDctrlzcA disabled then the file would be written out with new
    lines as 'cD\r\ncA' and with no ending ctrl-z.

    If auto is not enabled then the file is written out in the style of the
    current platform, regardless of the current settings on modes cDcrcA, cDlfcA and
    cDctrlzcA.


cESUMMARY cA


    The operation on the modes may be summarized as follows:-


cEUNIX Systems  cA


    - cDauto EnabledcA UNIX and MS-DOS files may be edited normally, edits are
          saved in the format read by the system.
    - cDauto DisabledcA UNIX files may be edited normally, files saved as UNIX
          files. MS-DOS files show a ^M character at the end of each line
          (editing is not advised if the purity of the MS-DOS is to be
          maintained), any edits are written back as displayed on the screen.


cEMS-DOS Systems  cA


    - cDauto EnabledcA UNIX and MS-DOS files may be edited normally, edits are
          saved in the format read by the system.
    - cDauto DisabledcA on reading all files are read and editing may be
          undertaken normally. On writing, '\r's and a ctrl-Z are
          automatically added. The act of reading a UNIX file and re-writing
          it translates it to an MS-DOS file.


cENOTES cA


    This mode MUST be enabled globally when the file is loaded for the file
    style to be correctly detected.

    It is cDstrongly advisedcA that auto mode is permanently enabled.

    Windows systems tend to use a 'cD\r\ncA' style line feed but with no trailing
    ctrl-z.

cEcENAME cEcA


    backup - Automatic file backup of last edit


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDbackup ModecA

    cDBcA - mode line letter.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDbackupcA mode, when enabled, performs an automatic backup of the last edit
    when a save file operation is performed. The backup file name is derived
    from the base file name and is written into the same directory as the
    source file, the backup file name can be obtained from the variable
    ls$buffer-backup(5)lm$buffer-backup(5)le.

    On unlimited file name length systems the naming convention used depends
    on bit cD0x400cA of variable ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le, if this bit is set then the system
    simulates a DOS style 8.3 file naming convention. If this bit is clear
    then variable ls$kept-versions(5)lm$kept-versions(5)le can be used to create multiple backup
    files.

    Where an existing backup file already exists, then the old backup file is
    removed and replaced by the newer backup file. The naming convention for
    backup files is defined as follows:-

       On unlimited length file name systems (UNIX and some Windows systems)
       with a single backup file, the following file naming conventions are
       used for file cGxxxxxcA:

              xxxxx -> xxxxx~

       On unlimited length file name systems with multiple backup files, the
       following file naming conventions are used for file cGxxxxxcA:

              xxxxx -> xxxxx.~?~

       Where cG?cA is the backup number, the most recent backup file is always
       cGcG.~0~cAcA.

       On systems with an cGxxxxxxxx.yyycA file name (MS-DOS etc), the following
       file naming conventions are used:

              xxxxxxxx      -> xxxxxxxx.~~~
              xxxxxxxx.yyy  -> xxxxxxxx.yy~
              xxxxxxxx.yyyy -> xxxxxxxx.yyy~

      The environment variables ls$MEBACKUPPATH(5)lm$MEBACKUPPATH(5)le and ls$MEBACKUPSUB(5)lm$MEBACKUPSUB(5)le can be used
      to modify this behaviour.


cENOTES cA


    cDbackupcA is enabled by default.

    crypt - Encrypted file mode


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDcrypt ModecA

    cDYcA - mode line letter.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDcryptcA mode enables encrypted files to be loaded and saved for security
    purposes. The key can be set at any time using the command
    lsset-encryption-key(2)lmset-encryption-key(2)le. Warning, take care if setting this as a global
    mode, it can have side-effects.

    The encryption algorithm is a Beaufort Cipher with a variant key. This is
    reasonably difficult to decrypt. When you write out text, if cGcryptcA mode is
    active and there is no encryption key, MicroEmacs 2009 will ask:

        `Encryption String:`

    Type in a word or phrase of at least five and up to 128 characters for the
    encryption to use. If you look at the file which is then written out, all
    the printable characters have been scrambled. To read such a file later,
    use lsfind-cfile(3)lmfind-cfile(3)le to load cCciphertextcA files, you will be asked the
    encryption key before the file is read.

    magic - Regular expression search


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDmagic ModecA

    cDMcA - mode line letter.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDmagiccA mode enables the regular expression search capability used in the
    search and the replace commands such as lssearch-forward(2)lmsearch-forward(2)le and
    lsquery-replace-string(2)lmquery-replace-string(2)le.

    In the magic mode of MicroEmacs 2009, certain characters gain special
    meanings when used in a search pattern. Collectively they are know as
    regular expressions, and a limited number of them are supported in
    MicroEmacs 2009. They grant greater flexibility when using the search
    commands (note that they also affect lsisearch-forward(2)lmisearch-forward(2)le commands).

    The symbols that have special meaning in magic mode are cG^cA, cG$cA, cG.cA, cG\|cA, cG*cA, cG[cA
    cG]cA, cG\(cA cG\)cA, cG\{cA cG\}cA and cG\cA.

    The characters cG^cA and cG$cA fix the search pattern to the beginning and end of
    line, respectively. The cG^cA character must appear at the beginning of the
    search string, and the cG$cA must appear at the end, otherwise they loose
    their meaning and are treated just like any other character. For example,
    in magic mode, searching for the pattern cGcGt$cAcA would put the cursor at the
    end of any line that ended with the letter cCcGtcAcA. Note that this is
    different than searching for cGcGt<NL>cAcA, that is, cCcGtcAcA followed by a newline
    character. The character cG$cA (and cG^cA, for that matter) matches a position,
    not a character, so the cursor remains at the end of the line. But a
    newline is a character that must be matched, just like any other
    character, which means that the cursor is placed just after it - on the
    beginning of the next line.

    The character cCcG.cAcA has a very simple meaning - it matches any single
    character, except the newline. Thus a search for cGcGbad.ercAcA could match
    cGcGbadgercAcA, cGcGbaddercAcA (slang), or up to the cCcGrcAcA of cG`bad error`cA.

    The character cG*cA is known as closure, and means that zero or more of the
    preceding character will match. If there is no character preceding, cG*cA has
    no special meaning, and since it will not match with a newline, cG*cA will
    have no special meaning if preceded by the beginning of line symbol cG^cA or
    the literal newline character cG<NL>cA. The notion of zero or more characters
    is important. If, for example, your cursor was on the line

       This line is missing two vowels.


    and a search was made for cGcGa*cAcA, the cursor would not move, because it is
    guaranteed to match no letter cCcGacAcA, which satisfies the search conditions.
    If you wanted to search for one or more of the letter 'a', you would
    search for cGcGaa*cAcA, which would match the letter cGacA, then zero or more of
    them, note that this pattern is better searched using cGcGa+cAcA.

    The character cGcG+cAcA is the same as cGcG*cAcA except that it searches for one or
    more occurrences of the preceding character.

    The character cG[cA indicates the beginning of a character class. It is
    similar to the cCanycA (cG.cA) character, but you get to choose which characters
    you want to match. The character class is ended with the character cG]cA. So,
    while a search for cGcGba.ecAcA will match cGcGbanecAcA, cGcGbadecAcA, cGcGbalecAcA, cGcGbatecAcA, et
    cetera, you can limit it to matching cGcGbabecAcA and cGcGbakecAcA by searching for
    cGcGba[bk]ecAcA. Only one of the characters inside the cG[cA and cG]cA will match a
    character. If in fact you want to match any character except those in the
    character class, you can put a cG^cA as the first character. It must be the
    first character of the class, or else it has no special meaning. So, a
    search for cG[^aeiou]cA will match any character except a vowel, but a search
    for cG[aeiou^]cA will match any vowel or a cG^cA. If you have a lot of characters
    in order that you want to put in the character class, you may use a dash
    (cG-cA) as a range character. So, cG[a-z]cA will match any letter (or any lower
    case letter if exact mode is on), and cG[0-9a-f]cA will match any digit or any
    letter cCcGacAcA through cCcGfcAcA, which happen to be the characters for hexadecimal
    numbers. If the dash is at the beginning or end of a character class, it
    is taken to be just a dash.

    The cG?cA character provides a simple zero or one occurrence test of the
    previous character e.g. cGcGca?rcAcA matches cGcGcrcAcA and cGcGcarcAcA, it will not match
    cGcGcaarcAcA.

    Where a previous item has a range of repetitions then the cG\{N,M\}cA syntax
    may be used to denote the minimum and maximum iterations of the previous
    item. Where a set quantity of repetitions is required then the simpler
    syntax of cG\{N\}cA may be used. i.e. cGcGca\{2\}rcAcA matches cGcGcaarcAcA, cGcGca\{2,3\}rcAcA
    matches cGcGcaarcAcA and cGcGcaaarcAcA.

    The escape character cG\cA is for those times when you want to be in magic
    mode, but also want to use a regular expression character to be just a
    character. It turns off the special meaning of the character. So a search
    for cGcGit\.cAcA will search for a line with cGcGit.cAcA, and not cGcGitcAcA followed by any
    other character. The escape character will also let you put cG^cA, cG-cA, or cG]cA
    inside a character class with no special side effects.

    In lsquery-replace-string(2)lmsearch-replacele strings the cG\(cA cG\)cA pair may be used to group characters
    for in the search string for recall in the replacement string. The cG\(cA cG\)cA
    bracket pair is recalled using cG\1cA-cG\9cA in the replace string, cG\1cA is the
    first pair, cG\1cA the second and so on. Hence to replace cG%dgdg%name%dhdh%cA
    with cG%dgdg%names%dhdh%cA then we could use the following search replace
    string cG\(%[a-z]+%\)\([a-z]*\)\(%[a-z]+%\)cA replacing with cG\1\2s\3cA.

    cG\0cA in the replace string implies the whole string.

    A summary of magic mode special characters are defined as follows:-

       cD^cA

             Anchor search at beginning of line

       cD$cA

             Anchor search at end of line

       cD.cA

             Match any character except <NL>

       cD*cA

             Match zero or more occurrences of the preceding item.

       cD\|cA

             Match either/or i.e. car\|bike matches the work car and matches
              the word bike.

       cD+cA

             Match one or more occurrences of the preceding item.

       cD?cA

             Match zero or one occurrences of the preceeding item.

       cD[]cA

             Match a class of characters ([a-z] would be all alphabetics)

       cD\cA

             Take next literally

       cD\{cAcCNcAcD,_cAM_cD\}cA

             Match a minimum of N occurrences and maximum of M occurrences of
              the preceeding item.

       cD\{cAcCNcAcD\}cA

             Match a N occurrences of the preceeding item.

       cD\(...\)cA

             Delimit pattern to replicate in replace string. Max of 9 allowed.
              Called in replace string with \1,..,\9. 1 being 1st etc. \0 or \&
              in the replace string is the whole string. i.e.

             Search: \(ab\)\(dc\)
              Replace: \1\2 \1\2
              on "abdc" => "abdc abdc"

    (see ls$buffer-fill-col(5)lm$buffer-fill-col(5)le), allowing text to be entered non-stop on a
    standard screen without bothering to use the cGRETURNcA key.

    cDwrapcA mode is usually used in conjunction with the lsjustify(2m)lmjustify(2m)le and
    lsindent(2m)lmindent(2m)le modes for editing text documents.

    cDwrapcA mode also automatically wraps long lines in the output of an

    binary - Binary editor mode


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDbinary ModecA

    cDbcA - mode line letter.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDbinarycA mode is enabled when a file is edited in binary mode. The mode is
    automatically enabled when a file is loaded as a binary file via
    lsfind-bfile(3)lmfind-bfile(3)le.

    When a file is loaded using binary mode, every 16 bytes is converted into
    a line of text giving the hex address of the current position in the file,
    the bytes as hexadecimal numbers and all printable characters at the end
    of the line (all non-printable characters are displayed as a cCcG.cAcA).
    However, This format makes it memory hungry in that every 16 bytes of the
    file requires a 78 character line (approximately 5 times more memory!).
    For a more memory efficient binary mode see lsrbin(2m)lmrbin(2m)le.

    When writing out a file which has binary mode enabled the format of each
    line must have the binary mode format which is as follows:

       <address>: XX XX XX XX XX .... XX XX | <text-form>


    Only the hex values (the cGXXcA's) between the starting 'cC:cA' marker and the
    terminating '|' character are used, the cC<address>cA and cC<text-form>cA are
    ignored.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    Given a single line MSDOS file:-

       Live long and prosper.


    When loaded in using cDbinarycA mode the following 2 line buffer will be
    produced:-

       00000000: 4C 69 76 65 20 6C 6F 6E 67 20 61 6E 64 20 70 72  |  Live long and pr
       00000010: 6F 73 70 65 72 2E 0D 0A 1A                       |  osper....


    Note the cG`0D 0A 1A`cA at the end, this is due to MSDOS's cGcG\n\rcAcA carriage
    returns and cG^ZcA file termination, these characters are unprintable and are
    shown as cCcG.cAcA at the end of the line.

    When saving a binary file, only the text between the cCcG:cAcA and cCcG|cAcA is
    considered and it may contain any number of hexadecimal numbers. The given
    file could be made UNIX compatible by editing the buffer to:-

       00000000: 4C 69 76 65 20 6C 6F 6E 67 20 61 6E 64 20 70 72  |  Live long and pr
       00000010: 6F 73 70 65 72 2E 0D                       |  osper....


    If the word "cDlongcA" is required to be removed, the following would not
    work:-

       00000000: 4C 69 76 65 20 6C 6F 6E 67 20 61 6E 64 20 70 72  |  Live and pr
       00000010: 6F 73 70 65 72 2E 0D 0A 1A                       |  osper....


    The ASCII end letters are ignored, instead the following operation must be
    performed which removes the characters from the binary representation:-

       00000000: 4C 69 76 65 20 61 6E 64 20 70 72  |  Live long and pr
       00000010: 6F 73 70 65 72 2E 0D 0A 1A                       |  osper....


    One could be nasty by doing the following:-

       00000000: 4C 69 76 65 20 73 68 6F 72 74 20 61 6E 64 20 |
       00000010: 64 6F 6E 27 74 20 70 72 6F 73 70 65 72 2E 0D 0A 1A           |


    ("Live short and don't prosper").

    autosv - Automatic file save


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDautosv ModecA

    cDacA - mode line letter.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    When this mode is enabled when the buffer is changed it will be
    automatically saved to a temporary file ls$auto-time(5)lm$auto-time(5)le later.

    Automatic saving for a buffer will not occur if

       The buffer name starts with a '*', this is considered a temporary
       system buffer.

      ls$auto-time(5)lm$auto-time(5)le is set to 0, this disables auto-saving for all buffers.

       The buffer does not a file name from which to generate a temporary
       file name. When this occurs the error message:

        `[Auto-writeout failure for buffer xxxxx]`

       MicroEmacs 2009 can not write to the generated temporary file name.
       When this occurs the error message:

        `[Auto-writeout failure for file xxxxx#]`

    On unlimited length file name systems (UNIX), the temporary file naming
    convention used for file cGxxxxxcA:

       `xxxxx -> xxxxx#`

    On systems with an cGxxxxxxxx.yyycA file name (DOS etc), the following file
    naming convention is used:

       `xxxxxxxx     -> xxxxxxxx.###`
       `xxxxxxxx.y   -> xxxxxxxx.y##`
       `xxxxxxxx.yy  -> xxxxxxxx.yy#`
       `xxxxxxxx.yyy -> xxxxxxxx.yy#`


cENOTES cA


    This mode MUST be enabled globally when the file is loaded for the file
    style to be correctly detected.

    It is cDstrongly advisedcA that autosv mode is permanently enabled.

    Auto-save files of URL files (i.e. cGcGftp://...cAcA and cGcGhttp://...cAcA) are
    written to the system's temporary directory. This avoids potentially slow
    auto-saves. This can however lead to recovery problems as the buffer name
    must be used to avoid auto-saving conflict with other buffers with the
    same base file name but different paths.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDrbincA mode is enabled when a file is edited in reduced binary mode. The
    mode is automatically enabled when a file is loaded as a binary data file
    via lsfind-file(2)lmfind-file(2)le.

    When a file is loaded using cDrbincA mode, every 256 bytes is converted into a

    long, 2 bytes for each character. This format is not very user friend
    unlike lsbinary(2m)lmbinary(2m)le mode, but is much more memory efficient (requiring
    approximately 2 times more memory than the file size).

    When writing out a file which has rbin mode enabled the format of each

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDfencecA mode can be used to enable or disable the automatic displaying of

    is temporarily move to the position of the opening fence. The duration of
    the move can be controlled by the ls$pause-time(5)lm$pause-time(5)le variable; any user input
    interrupts the display.

    If the buffer is configured to use a cCCcA style auto lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le, the search
    algorithm used is 'cCCcA' aware and if a matching fence is not found then the
    bell is rung as a warning. Otherwise any closing fence which cannot be
    matched is ignored.

    The cursor can be moved to the matching fence using the
    lsgoto-matching-fence(2)lmgoto-matching-fence(2)le command.


cENOTES cA


    The following are considered closing fences:

! 2 languageTemplates
cEcEFILE LANGUAGE TEMPLATES cEcA


    MicroEmacs 2009 provides a large range of macros and templates to deal
    with the most commonly occurring types of ASCII file that may be edited.
    However, there is a requirement for users to extend this capability to
    include more obscure file types, in addition to bespoke files found
    internally within organizations, or devised by the user.

    For each file type, MicroEmacs 2009 may be tailored to recognize the file
    and modify it's hilighting, key binding configuration, osd display and
    indentation to accommodate the file. In addition, new shorthand macros may
    be introduced to help deal with the contents of the file.

    This section outlines the steps to be taken to integrate a new file
    language template into MicroEmacs 2009. lsbuffer-init(3)lmbuffer-init(3)le automates many of
    the operations defined below and it is suggested that this is a preferable
    method to add a new language template into MicroEmacs.


cEThe scope of the File Type  cA


    The first step is to decide the scope of the file, this will determine
    where the file hook should be defined. The options are:-

    cDA standard file type not supportedcA
    
       If this is a standard file type not supported by MicroEmacs 2009 then
       it should be added to cGme.emfcA, in addition lsMicroEmacs - Contact Informationlmcontact usle and we will add
       it to the standard release. Any macro files associated with this file
       type should be available globally and are added to the MicroEmacs
       cCmacrocA directory.

    cDLocal To your organizationcA
    
       If it is a file type local to your organization then it should be
       added to your cCcompanycA.emf file. Any macro files associated with the
       file type should be added to your local company MicroEmacs 2009
       directory.

    cDLocal to an individualcA

       If this is a file type that is only used by a limited number of
       individuals then it should be added to the cCusercA.emf file. Any files
       associated with the file type are added to your local user MicroEmacs
       2009 directory.


cERecognizing the File Type  cA


    The next step to adding a new file type is to get MicroEmacs 2009 to
    recognize the file as the new type. Recognition is performed by the
    lsfileHooks(2)lmFile Hooksle which perform recognition on the file extension and/or
    the file content. The name of the file type must be determined, this is typically
    the name of the file prepended by cGhkcA. e.g. a file with extension cCfoocA uses
    the file cGhkfoo.emfcA for it's language specific definitions.

    Using the lsadd-file-hook(2)lmadd-file-hook(2)le invocation the file recognition is bound to the
    file hook macro whenever the file type is loaded. The file hook is added
    to the appropriate global, company or user start up file as determined in
    step 1. The file hooks for file cCfoocA might be defined as follows, depending
    upon the recognition method:-

    cDRecognizing the extensioncA
    
       To recognize the file extension, then a space separated list of
       extensions may be defined, including the dot cCcG.cAcA (or other) extension
       separator.

sB
              add-file-hook ".foo"       fhook-foo

sA
    cDRecognizing a magic editor string in the filecA
 
        If the file type adopts multiple extensions (or does not use a file
       extension) then an editor specific string may be inserted into the
       file to enable the editor to recognize it, typically of the form cG-!-cA
       cCtypecA cG-!-cA, if the string is GNU Emacs compatible then the cG-*-cA
       convention may be used. The binding is defined as:-

sB
              -1 add-file-hook "-!-[ \t]*foo.*-!-"           fhook-foo

sA
    cDRecognizing a magic string in the filecA
    
       UNIX files use a cGcG#!<path>cAcA notation for executable ASCII files. If
       the file is this type of file (or uses any other type of common string
       in the as the first characters of a file) then the binding may be
       defined as follows, in this case we have assumed cCfoocA is the UNIX
       executable variety i.e. cG#!/usr/local/bin/foocA:-

sB
              1 add-file-hook "^#!/.*foo" fhook-foo

sA
    Any, or all of the above recognition methods may be employed to invoke the
    language specific macro. Note that the methods are evaluated in a LIFO
    order, hence it is possible to over-ride an existing method.


cEDefining the Macro File  cA


    Once the hook has been defined, the language specific file must be
    created. Create the language specific file with the same name as defined
    in the hooks, removing the cDfhook-cA prefix and replacing it with cDhkcA, i.e.
    cGfhook-foocA invokes the language specific file cGhkfoo.emfcA. Create, the file
    and add the file hook macro. for example cGhkfoo.emfcA contents may be defined
    as:

sB
          define-macro fhook-foo
              ; Temporary comment to make sure that it works.
              ml-write "Loaded a foo file"
          !emacro
          ml-write "[MicroEmacs foo file hook loaded]"

sA
    The file hook may be tested by exiting and re-loading MicroEmacs 2009, or
    simply by executing the file containing the cDadd-file-hookcA function. Once
    the file bindings are installed a cCfoocA file may be loaded and the hook
    message should be displayed.

    The best way to create a new file hook is to find an existing file type
    with similar support to the new file hook you wish to create and re-use
    the hook code to create the new one.


cEModifying an Existing file hook  cA


    The standard file hooks supplied with MicroEmacs 2009 should not be
    modified, typically a user will want to extend the repertoire of
    hi-lighting tokens to encompass locally defined programming libraries or
    syntactical extensions, in addition to extending support macros that are
    associated with the file type. In this case, an extension to the hook
    function is required. The hook file cDmyXXX.emfcA, allows extensions to be
    made to the cDhkXXX.emfcA, without editing the original file. This may be
    considered to be an cCincludecA file and is executed, if it exists, after the
    cDhkcA file has been executed. i.e. if the hook file cDhkfoo.emfcA is already
    defined and extensions are added to cDmyfoo.emfcA.

    Note that the cDmyXXX.emfcA files do not typically include any cDfhook-XXXcA
    functions, the original cCfhookcA functions would be used. However, if a
    different buffer environment is required from the one created be the hook,
    such as a different setting of lstab(2m)lmtab(2m)le mode, the hook function should be
    copied to cDmyXXX.emfcA and altered appropriately.

    Most extensions and changes to the buffer environment may be performed
    using cDmyXXX.emfcA. If the extension macro file includes a macro definition
    cDmy-fhook-XXXcA, then cDmy-fhookXXXcA is automatically executed after cDfhookXXXcA
    has been run.


cEAdding Hilighting definitions  cA


    File specific hilighting is used to pick out key words and tokens used
    within the file type, it greatly improves readability; the hilighting is
    also used for lsprint-buffer(2)lmprintingle. The hilighting is defined within the body of the
    file and is executed once when the hook file is loaded, this occurs when
    the hook function is executed. During development of the hilighting code,
    it is usually necessary to lsexecute-buffer(2)lmexecutele the hook buffer to view the effects of
    any changes to the hilighting.

    The hilighting is defined using the command lshilight(2)lmhilight(2)le which requires a
    hilighting identifier, used to identify the hilighting scheme. This
    identifier is dynamically allocated when the hook file is loaded, again
    using cCfoocA, the identifier is allocated at the top of the file and is
    protected such that a value is assigned once only.

sB
          !if &sequal .hilight.foo "ERROR"
              set-variable .hilight.foo &pinc .hilight.next 1
          !endif

sA
    The variable cG.hilight.nextcA allocates unique hilighting numbers, typically
    a single hilighting number is consumed, incrementing the cG.hilight.nextcA
    variable ready for the next allocation. The hilighting color scheme is
    defined in a macro variable cG.hilight.extcA, where cCextcA is the name of the
    language scheme (i.e. cCfoocA).

    Given a hilighting number, the hilighting scheme may be defined. Each of
    the tokens in the language is assigned a hilighting color, for our simple
    cCfoocA file type:-

sB
          0 hilight .hilight.foo 1                $global-scheme
          hilight .hilight.foo 2 "#"              .scheme.comment
          hilight .hilight.foo 4 "\"" "\"" "\\"   .scheme.string
          hilight .hilight.foo 0 "'.'"            .scheme.quote
          hilight .hilight.foo 0 "'\\\\.'"        .scheme.quote ; '\?' quoted char

          hilight .hilight.foo 1 "if"             .scheme.keyword
          hilight .hilight.foo 1 "then"           .scheme.keyword
          hilight .hilight.foo 1 "else"           .scheme.keyword
          hilight .hilight.foo 1 "endif"          .scheme.keyword

sA
    When the hilighting tokens have been defined, the hilighting scheme is
    bound to the buffer. This is performed by assigning ls$buffer-hilight(5)lm$buffer-hilight(5)le
    with the hilighting scheme within the cCfhookcA macro body, e.g.

sB
          define-macro fhook-foo
              ; Assign the hilighting
              set-variable $buffer-hilight .hilight.foo
              ; Temporary comment to make sure that it works.
              ml-write "Loaded a foo file"
          !emacro

sA
    Putting it all together cGhkfoo.emfcA now comprises:-

sB
          !if &sequal .hilight.foo "ERROR"
              ; Allocate a hilighting scheme number
              set-variable .hilight.foo &pinc .hilight.next 1
          !endif

          ; Define the hilighting scheme
          0 hilight .hilight.foo 1                $global-scheme
          hilight .hilight.foo 2 "#"              .scheme.comment
          hilight .hilight.foo 4 "\"" "\"" "\\"   .scheme.string
          hilight .hilight.foo 0 "'.'"            .scheme.quote
          hilight .hilight.foo 0 "'\\\\.'"        .scheme.quote ; '\?' quoted char

          hilight .hilight.foo 1 "if"             .scheme.keyword
          hilight .hilight.foo 1 "then"           .scheme.keyword
          hilight .hilight.foo 1 "else"           .scheme.keyword
          hilight .hilight.foo 1 "endif"          .scheme.keyword

          ; File hook - called when new file is loaded.
          define-macro fhook-foo
              ; Assign the hilighting
              set-variable $buffer-hilight .hilight.foo
              ; Temporary comment to make sure that it works.
              ml-write "Loaded a foo file"
          !emacro

          ; Notification that hook is loaded.
          ml-write "[MicroEmacs foo file hook loaded]"

sA
cEAdding a Template  cA


    A template inserts initial text into a new file that is created. This
    mechanism is typically used to insert a standard header into the file on
    creation. The insertion text is defined within a template file, given the
    file extension lsetf(8)lmetf(8)le, which is created in the corresponding global,
    company or user directory as determined in step 1. The template is named
    cCextcA.etf, so for our example file cCfoocA, the template file is called cGfoo.etfcA.
    We shall simply add a file header, our comment is cG#cA (as defined by the
    hilighting tokens). Our example cCfoocA template file cGfoo.etfcA may be defined
    as follows:-


       #-!- foo -!- #################################
       #
       #  Created By    : $USER_NAME$
       #  Created       : $ASCII_TIME$
       #  Last Modified : <160495.1521>
       #
       #  Description
       #
       #  Notes
       #
       #  History
       #
       #  Copyright (c) $YEAR$ $COMPANY_NAME$.
       ##############################################


    The template file must be explicitly loaded by the hook file, within the
    cDfhookcA function. A new file condition may be tested within the fhook macro
    by checking the numerical argument, an argument of 0 indicates that this
    is a new file. The template file is inserted with an invocation of
    lsetfinsrt(3)lmetfinsrt(3)le. The fhook macro checks the argument and inserts the template
    file as follows:-

sB
          ; File hook - called when new file is loaded.
          define-macro fhook-foo
              ; if arg is 0 this is a new file so add template
              !if &not @#
                  etfinsrt "foo"
              !endif
              ; Assign the hilighting
              set-variable $buffer-hilight .hilight.foo
              ; Temporary comment to make sure that it works.
              ml-write "Loaded a foo file"
          !emacro

sA
cEAdding abbreviations  cA


    Abbreviations are short-cut expansions which may be defined for the
    language specific file. The abbreviations are defined in a lseaf(8)lmeaf(8)le file,
    cCextcA.eaf, located in the appropriately defined MicroEmacs directory. The
    abbreviation file defines the key sequences which may be automatically
    inserted, under user intervention, using lsexpand-abbrev(2)lmexpand-abbrev(2)le. An abbreviation
    file for cCfoocA, cGfoo.eafcA, may be defined as:-

       if "if \p\rthen\rendif\P"
       el "else\r\p\P"


    The binding to the hook is defined in the cCfhookcA macro using
    lsbuffer-abbrev-file(2)lmbuffer-abbrev-file(2)le. For the example language file foo the fhook macro
    becomes:-

sB
          ; File hook - called when new file is loaded.
          define-macro fhook-foo
              ; if arg is 0 this is a new file so add template
              !if &not @#
                  etfinsrt "foo"
              !endif
              ; Assign the hilighting
              set-variable $buffer-hilight .hilight.foo
              ; Set the abbreviation file
              buffer-abbrev-file "foo"
              ; Temporary comment to make sure that it works.
              ml-write "Loaded a foo file"
          !emacro

sA
cEAutomatic Indentation  cA


    Automatic indentation may be applied to the file, such that the
    indentation is automatically performed when new lines are entered into the
    file. Indentation also benefits from automatic re-styling operations using
    lsrestyle-region(3)lmrestyle-region(3)le and lsrestyle-buffer(3)lmrestyle-buffer(3)le.

    The indentation style is declared by defining language tokens that
    constitute positions in the syntax where the indentation is changed. The
    indentation requires a unique identifier to identify the indentation
    style, the hilighting identifier is used. If hilighting is not defined,
    then the language template may still obtain an identifier as described in
    the hilighting section.

    The indention is create with an argument of cG0cA to the lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le command,
    the subsequent tokens are defined using cDindentcA with no argument. For our
    simple cCfoocA syntax then the indentation might be defined as follows:-

sB
          0 indent  .hilight.foo 2 10
          indent .hilight.foo n "then" 4
          indent .hilight.foo s "else" -4
          indent .hilight.foo o "endif" -4

sA
    This provides an indentation of the form:-

       if condition
       then
              XXXX
       else
              if condition
              then
                  XXXX
              endif
       endif


    The indentation is bound to the buffer in the cCfhookcA macro by defining
    ls$buffer-indent(5)lm$buffer-indent(5)le. For the example file foo then the fhook is defined as:-

sB
          ; File hook - called when new file is loaded.
          define-macro fhook-foo
              ; if arg is 0 this is a new file so add template
              !if &not @#
                  etfinsrt "foo"
              !endif
              ; Assign the hilighting
              set-variable $buffer-hilight .hilight.foo
              ; Assign the buffer indentation
              set-variable $buffer-indent .hilight.foo
              ; Set the abbreviation file
              buffer-abbrev-file "foo"
              ; Temporary comment to make sure that it works.
              ml-write "Loaded a foo file"
          !emacro

sA
cESetting Buffer Modes  cA


    Buffer modes which are to be adopted (or discarded) by the language
    specific file are defined in the cCfhookcA macro. Typical modes that are
    applied are:-

    lstime(2m)lmtimele
    
       Enables time stamping on the file, modifying the time stamp field with
       the modification date and time.

    lsindent(2m)lmindentle
    
       Automatic indentation, where the cursor is returned to the same column
       on entering a new line, rather than to the start of the line.

    As an example, the cCfoocA cCfhookcA file becomes:-

sB
          ; File hook - called when new file is loaded.
          define-macro fhook-foo
              ; if arg is 0 this is a new file so add template
              !if &not @#
                  etfinsrt "foo"
              !endif
              ; Assign the hilighting
              set-variable $buffer-hilight .hilight.foo
              ; Assign the buffer indentation
              set-variable $buffer-indent .hilight.foo
              ; Set the abbreviation file
              buffer-abbrev-file "foo"
              ; Set up the buffer modes
              1 buffer-mode "time"
              1 buffer-mode "indent"
              ; Temporary comment to make sure that it works.
              ml-write "Loaded a foo file"
          !emacro

sA
cEAssigning New Bindings  cA


    New bindings and language specific macros may be added to the language
    specific file. New macros, to extend the repertoire of commands
    specifically developed for the language file are defined within the macro
    body using lsdefine-macro(2)lmdefine-macro(2)le these are automatically loaded when the hook
    file is loaded, which in turn is loaded when the file type is identified
    and loaded.

    New bindings, which may be associated with new macros or existing
    commands, are assigned within the cCfhookcA macro. As an example, we shall
    extend the cCfoocA language file to include a commenting and uncommenting
    macros, locally binding the macros to the keys cG`C-c C-c`cA and cG`C-c C-d`cA
    respectively. The macro definitions are defined as follows:-

sB
          ; Macro to comment a line
          define-macro foo-comment-line
              !while &gre &pdec @# 1 0
                  beginning-of-line
                  insert-string "#"
                  beginning-of-line
                  forward-line
              !done
          !emacro

          ; Macro to remove a comment from a line
          define-macro foo-uncomment-line
              !while &gre &pdec @# 1 0
                  beginning-of-line
                  -1 search-forward "#"
                  backward-delete-char
                  forward-line
              !done
          !emacro

sA
    The key bindings for the macros are defined for the local buffer ONLY, as
    such are added using lsbuffer-bind-key(2)lmbuffer-bind-key(2)le. The bindings are declared in the
    cCfhookcA macro as follows:-

sB
          ; File hook - called when new file is loaded.
          define-macro fhook-foo
              ; if arg is 0 this is a new file so add template
              !if &not @#
                  etfinsrt "foo"
              !endif
              ; Assign the hilighting
              set-variable $buffer-hilight .hilight.foo
              ; Assign the buffer indentation
              set-variable $buffer-indent .hilight.foo
              ; Set the abbreviation file
              buffer-abbrev-file "foo"
              ; Set up the buffer modes
              1 buffer-mode "time"
              1 buffer-mode "indent"
              ; Set up local bindings
              buffer-bind-key foo-comment-line "C-c C-c"
              buffer-bind-key foo-uncomment-line "C-c C-d"
              ; Temporary comment to make sure that it works.

cEAllowing Other to Modify the Hook  cA


    Other users of the file hook may need to modify or extend the file hook,
    the most common form is the addition of user specific hilight tokens.
    MicroEmacs uses a simple mechanism of executing a user hook extension file
    if it exists. The extension file name must be of the form cDmyXXX.emfcA, i.e.
    for our example it must be cGcGmyfoo.emfcAcA. This is performed at the end of
    the macro file so that anything within the file can be altered, it is
    executed as follows:-

sB
          ; load in user extensions if found
          !force execute-file "myfoo"

sA
    Note the ls!force(4)lm!force(4)le directive is used as the file may not exist.


cESumming Up  cA


    The previous sections have presented the basic steps involved in setting
    up a new language file template. They cater for simple file types, for
    more complex examples then browse the cDhkxxx.emfcA files.

    The completed files that should have been generated by following the
    previous examples are now presented:-

    cDfile.foocA

cEcEINSTALLATION cEcA


    This page provides introductory notes for the installation and setup of
    MicroEmacs 2009 build in 2024.

cESingle File Binary Install cA

    Since 2009 the prefered way for  installation  is the use of the single file
    binaries. The background is described here: lshttp://www.jasspa.com/zeroinst.htmllmhttp://www.jasspa.com/zeroinst.htmlle.
    The  MicroEmacs  executable  in this case contains the binary as well as all
    macro files and optionally as well some dictionary files and the help file.
    So the user only needs to  download a binary for its own  platform,  make it
    executable and place it into a directory  belonging to its cGPATHcA variable.
    Commonly these places are cG~/.bincA or cG~/.local/bincA for Unix systems. In
    2024 the following platforms and binaries are supported:
    
    - cCLinuxcA - Terminal (mecb) and Terminal and X11 version (mewb) were mainly 
      Debian and Red Hat based distros are provided  which might be used on many
      other distros - we provide kernel 4, 5 and 6 builds for x86_64 platforms. 
      There is as well a combined version (mecwb) which can run both in X11 mode
      or in terminal mode if the cG-ncA argument is provided.
    - cCFreeBSDcA - there are as well mecb, mewb and mecwb versions provided for 
      FreeBSD version 14 (and later) - see Linux for more info.
    - cCMacOScA - Terminal  (mecb) and  Terminal and X11 version  (mewb), the latter
      requires  the  XQuartz  extension,  MacOS 12 to 14  builds  are  currently
      available,  as with the Linux  build  there is as well a combined  version
      (mecw).
    - cCWindowscA - Terminal (mecb) and Windows version (mewb) - they should work on
      all recent Windows systems, we regular check only on Wine emulator.
    - cCCygwin-WindowscA  - For the Cygwin system (3.5 and higher) on Windows
      there are as well  prebuild executables  for the cygwin  terminal (mecb)
      and then as well GUI versions (mew and mecwb) which require the Cygwin X11
      libraries to be installed on Cygwin.
     
    cCInstallation:cA Just  download the file (mecb, mewb, mecwB) for your platform
    place it as mec, mew and me into a folder  belonging  to your  PATH, make it
    executable and run it.

    At the  first  run you will be asked  initially  for your  user name and the
    default  user path,  usually  it is  cG~/.jasspacA.  As it a first  step it is
    usually  required  to run the  command  cG"Esc x"  user-setupcA  to select the
    default  keyboad  and  language  in the dialog. You can as well use the menu
    entry  "Tools->User  Setup". If you run the terminal version you can as well
    execute  the menu with cG"Esc ="cA and using the cursor  keys. To get  Termcap
    colors you might in the terminal version as well select in the "User Setup -
    Platform Tab" the Termcap colors.  Thereafter your should restart the editor
    and in case  you do not get the  Termcap  colors  you can try to  start  the
    terminal version like this:
    
       `TERM=xterm mec FILENAME`
    
    Your user settings are stored in the folder cG~/.jasspacA usually, although this
    can be changed by  changing  the  cGMEPATHcA  environment  variable.  A common
    setting could be cGMEPATH=~/.config/jasspacA.
    
    If you run an  Ubuntu  executable  build  on the  Github  server  you  might
    sometimes  see for  instance on a Fedora  system a  libterminfo  warning you
    might throw this away by writing a Bash function in your .bashrc like this:
    
           function mecn {
              TERM=xterm mec "$@" 2> /dev/null
           }

    In case of problems you might as well try to use TERM=rxvt.
      
    cDGetting HelpcA
    
    In case of trouble use the issue link on the Github project page:
    https::/github.com/mittelmark/microemacs/issues

    Below is the old  description of an installation  for a simple me (mec, mew)
    executable  (terminal or  X11/Windows  version)  together  with the required
    macro files described. If you prefere the single file install just described
    above, you do not need to read further. 
    
    Hint: All macro files for the  standalone  builds are  accessible  using the
    bfs://macros path within your MicroEmacs text editor.
    
cEQuick Install of ME barebones and Macro Files cA

    2024: The information below is mostly outdated, it describes an installation
    of the barebone mec, mew and mecw executables  without attached macro folder
    which require a separate installation of the jasspa macros.

    The quickest way to install MicroEmacs for testing without reading the
    rest of this document is to:-

    - Create a new directory i.e. cGjasspacA.
    - Unpack the macros archive into this directory.
    - Unpack the executable into this directory.
    - Run cGmecA from this directory.

    On starting, you will be prompted for a default directory, accept the
    defaults. Use the mouse and configure the user from the menu bar:-

       Tools -> User Setup


    This allows the user and screen settings to be altered. On becoming more
    accustomed to the editor then a fuller installation may be performed.

    cDGetting HelpcA
    
       See lsContact InformationlmContact Informationle for full contact information. A mail archive
       exists at:-

              http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jasspa/ (not existing anymore)


       If you wish to participate in the list then you must first register by
       sending an empty mail message body to:-

              jasspa-subscribe@yahoogroups.com (not exiting anymore)


       You will then be able to mail any questions into the group.
       Registration is required in order to prevent cCspamcA mailings from
       entering into the lists.

       cDNOTE:cA The binary versions of the executables held on the site include
       the platform name as part of the executable name i.e. cDmecA for cGDOScA is
       called cDmedos.execA. On installing the binaries onto the target machine,
       you should rename the executable to cDmecA or cDme.execA, whatever is
       appropriate. The ONLY exception to this rule is the Microsoft Windows
       executable where cDmewin32.execA should be renamed to cDme32.execA. Our reason
       for this naming is to allow the executables to be unpacked in the same
       directory and not be confused with each other.


cEInstallation Directories  cA


    The suggested installation structure for all platforms is defined as:-

                    jasspa
                    / | \
                   /  |  \
                  /   |   \
           spelling macros company


    This directory structure is suggested to facilitate upgrades in the future
    and to keep user data separate from the system macros. MicroEmacs
    understands this directory structure.

    The directory structures are defined as:

    cDmacroscA
    
       The standard macro distribution, as supplied by JASSPA.

    cDspellingcA
    
       Spelling dictionaries.

cEUNIX Installation (System Wide)  cA


    A system wide installation on UNIX for multiple users adheres to
    conventional package installation methods.

    cDDistribution Components Required:cA

       `jasspa-me-`_<unix>_`-YYYYMMDD.gz`
       `jasspa-metree-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz`
       _<spelling>_`.gz`
       `jasspa-mehtml-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz` (optional)

    cDInstallation:cA
    
      It is recommended that the macro files are placed in a standard shared
      system directory. The standard directory locations searched by MicroEmacs
      are defined on a per-platform basis, only one of the directory locates is
      selected, as follows:

                                      HP-UX     SunOS      AIX      Cygwin
                                 IRIX     UnixWare   ***BSD    Linux      NeXT
       /opt/jasspa:             y    y    y    y    y    y    n    n    n
       /usr/share/jasspa:       y    y    y    y    y    y    y    n    n
       /usr/local/jasspa:       y    y    y    y    y    y    y    y    y
       /usr/local/share/jasspa: n    n    n    n    y    n    n    n    n


    - Create the directory cG/usr/local/jasspacA.
    - Unpack and install the cGjasspa-metree-YYYYMMDD.tar.gzcA into this
          directory.
    - If spelling dictionaries are required then place them in the
          spelling sub-directory created when metree was unpacked. Unpack and
          install the spelling into this directory.
    - If the standard icons are required for Gnome, KDE or some other
          window manager then create the sub-directory /usr/local/jasspa/icons
          and unpack and install the icons into the new directory.
    - Unpack (or build) the executable and place in cGcG/usr/local/bincAcA

    The executable may now be run by all users. If the macros are placed in a
    non-standard directory location then the environment variable
    ls$MEINSTALLPATH(5)lmMEINSTALLPATH(5)le to define the root jasspa tree.

    For cDcsh(1)cA users execute a cGcGrehashcAcA command and then lsme(1)lmme(1)le can be executed
    from the command line.

    By default a X-Windows terminal is displayed, ensure that cG$DISPLAYcA and
    cG$TERMcA are correctly configured. To execute a terminal emulation then
    execute cDmecA with the cG-ncA option i.e. cG`me -n`cA. Note that this is not required
    if you are using a cGvt100cA emulation.

    When MicroEmacs is executed the local directory cG~/.jasspacA is created for
    the user settings. The user home directory may be changed by setting the
    environment variable ls$MEPATH(5)lm$MEPATH(5)le.


cEUNIX Installation (Single User)  cA


    Where the user is not permitted to install 3rd party applications in the
    system directories then MicroEmacs may be installed locally as follows:-

    - Create the directory cG~/.jasspacA.
    - Unpack and install the cGjasspa-metree-YYYYMMDD.tar.gzcA into this
          directory.
    - If spelling dictionaries are required then place them in the
          spelling sub-directory created when metree was unpacked. Unpack and
          install the spelling into this directory.
    - If the standard icons are required for Gnome, KDE or some other
          window manager then create the sub-directory ~/.jasspa/icons and
          unpack and install the icons into the new directory.
    - The user files will be placed in the cG~/.jasspacA directory by default.
          To keep the user macros separate then the directory
          ~/.jasspa/$LOGNAME may be created and will identified as the users
          home directory.
    - Unpack (or build) the executable and place in cGcG~/bincAcA

    MicroEmacs may be executed after it has been re-hashed (depending on the
    shell).


cEDOS Installation  cA


    MS-DOS has no concept of a standard installation directory. The location
    of the MicroEmacs macros is generally determined from the directory
    location of the executable.

    cDExecutable:cA  Compiled with DJGPP V1.0

    Distribution components required:
    
       `jasspa-me-msdos-djgpp1-YYYYMMDD.zip`
       `jasspa-metree-YYYYMMDD.zip`
       _<spelling>_`.zip`

       `mewinhlp.zip` if you are using windows 3.1/3.11

    Recommended installed components:
    
       `grep` - Version of grep (djgpp recommended)
       `make` - Version of make (djgpp recommended)
       `diff` - Version of diff (djgpp recommended)

    cDInstallation:cA
 
    This installation relies on the executable position.

    - Create the directory cGc:\jasspacA (or other location)
    - Unpack and install the cGjasspa-metree-YYYYMMDD.zipcA into this
          directory.
    - If spelling dictionaries are required then place them in the
          spelling sub-directory created when metree was unpacked. Unpack and
          install the spelling into this directory.
    - Unzip the executable and place it in the jasspa root directory
          c:\jasspa.
    - Edit cGcGc:\autoexec.batcAcA and add the following lines:-


              SET PATH=%PATH%;c:\jasspa


    - Reboot the system.
    - MicroEmacs may be run from the command line using cDmecA.

    cDGraphics Cards:cA

    MicroEmacs may be configured to the text modes of your graphics card.
    Refer to you graphics card DOS text modes to identify the text modes
    supported by your monitor. The text mode number may be entered into the
    user monitor configuration, defined in cDToolscA -> cDUser SetupcA.

    Running DOS Version From Windows (3.x)
    
       The MS-DOS version of MicroEmacs may be executed from a cD.pifcA file. Use
       the pif editor to create a new cD.pifcA file to launch MicroEmacs. The
       size of the DOS window may be configured from the command line, set
       the terminal size using one of the following command lines:-

                  me -c -v$TERM=E80x50        - 80 x 50 window
                  me -c -v$TERM=E80x25        - 80 x 25 window.


       We usually add the cG-ccA option so that MicroEmacs is executed with
       history information. This may be omitted if required.


cEMicrosoft Windows 3.1/3.11  cA


    cDExecutable:cA  Compiled with Microsoft Developer 2.0

    cDHelper DLL:cA
 
    Under cDWin32scA a helper DLL cDmethnk16.dllcA is required to perform the
    lspipe-shell-command(2)lmpipe-shell-command(2)le in a synchronous manner. This should be installed
    into the cGC:\WINDOWS\SHELLcA directory. This (rather inelegantly) gets around
    the problems of spawning a process under cDwin32scA due to a number of
    Microsoft bugs in the operating system. Note: that on a spawn operation a
    cGMS-DOScA window is visible, this is due to the nature of the command shell
    on this platform which has a tendency to prompt the user at every
    opportunity, hence a certain amount of interaction (which is out of our
    control) is necessary.

    The helper DLL is compiled with a 16-bit Windows compiler - MSVC 1.5.

    cDDistribution components required:cA

       `jasspa-me-ms-win32s-YYYYMMDD.zip`
       `jasspa-metree-YYYYMMDD.zip`
       `jasspa-mewinhlp-YYYYMMDD.zip`
       _<spelling>_`.zip`

    cDRecommended installed components:cA

       `4dos` - command shell (giving _stderr_ redirection)
       `grep` - Version of grep (GNU port of grep recommended)
       `diff` - Version of diff (GNU port of grep recommended)
       `make` - use nmake or GNU port of make.

       If__win32s__ is a requirement on this platform, typically taken from
       __pw1118.exe__ which freely available on the Internet.

    cDInstallation:cA
    
    This version of Windows does not have a cCinstallcA directory as '95/'98 and
    it is expected that the cGMS-DOScA version will coexist. No cCInstallcA cCShieldcA
    installation is provided. Install in a directory structure similar to
    cGMS-DOScA. Install the helper DLL cDmethnk16.dllcA in the cGC:\WINDOWS\SHELLcA
    directory. Create a lsme32.ini(8)lmme32.ini(8)le file in the cGC:\WINDOWScA directory to
    identify the location of the MicroEmacs 2009 components, this much the
    same as the '95/'98 file, change the directory paths to suite the install
    base.

    cDSupport Status:cA

    The cDwin32scA release has not been used with vengeance, although no specific
    problems have been reported with this release.


cEWindows 95/98/NT/2K/XP  cA


    cDExecutable:cA Compiled with Microsoft Developer 6.x

    cDInstall ShieldcA

        An cDInstall ShieldcA version of MicroEmacs is available which includes
        all of the distribution components.

    cDDistribution components required:cA

      `jasspa-mepkg-ms-win32-2004030.zip`

    cDRecommended installed components:cA

       `grep` - Version of grep (GNU port of grep recommended)
       `diff` - Version of diff (GNU port of grep recommended)
       `make` - use nmake or GNU port of make.

       A good source of UNIX native tools is

      ` http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/` - for native windows grep, diff, zip
       etc.
      ` http://www.cygwin.com` - for a shell environment.

    cDInstallation:cA

    - Create the directory cG`c:\Program Files\Jasspa\MicroEmacs`cA (or other
          location)
    - Create the sub-directory `c:\Program Files\Jasspa\MicroEmacs\macros`.
          Unpack and install the memacros.zip into this directory
    - If spelling dictionaries are required then create the directory
          c:\Program Files\Jasspa\MicroEmacs\spelling. Unpack and install the
          spelling into this directory.
    - Unzip the executable components into "C:\Program
          Files\Jasspa\MicroEmacs"
    - Create a short cut to MicroEmacs for the Desktop

       Right click on the desk top

       `=> New`
       `=> Short`
       `=> Command Line: "c:\Program Files\Jasspa\MicroEmacs\me.exe -c"`
       `=> Short Cut Name: "MicroEmacs"`

       MicroEmacs may be executed from the shortcut.

    cDOpen ActionscA Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT provide short cut actions,
    assigning an open action to a file. The short cuts may be installed from
    the cDInstall ShieldcA installation, but may alternatively be explicitly
    defined by editing the registry file with cDregedit(1)cA.

    A file open action in the registry is bound to the file file extension, to
    bind a file extension cC.foocA to the editor then the following registry
    entries should be defined:-

        [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.foo]
         "MicroEmacs_foo"
        [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MicroEmacs_foo\DefaultIcon]
         "C:\Program File\JASSPA\MicroEmacs\meicons,23"
        [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MicroEmacs_foo\Shell\open]
         "&Open"
        [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MicroEmacs_foo\Shell\open\command]
         "C:\Program File\JASSPA\MicroEmacs\me32.exe -o "%1""


    In the previous example the cCDefaultIconcA entry is the icon assigned to the
    file. This may be an icon taken from cGmeicons.execA (in this case icon number
    23), or may be some other icon. The open action in the example uses the cD-ocA
    option of the cCclient-servercA, which loads the file into the current
    MicroEmacs 2009 session, alternatively the cD-ccA option may be used to retain
    the previous context, or no option if a new session with no other files
    loaded is started.

    A generic open for ALL files may be defined using a wild-card, this may be
    used to place a cCMicroEmacscA edit entry in the right-click pop-up menu, as
    follows:-

        [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell]
        [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\MicroEmacs]
         "&MicroEmacs"
        [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\MicroEmacs\command]
         "C:\Program File\JASSPA\MicroEmacs\me32.exe -o "%1""


cEORGANIZING A LOCAL USER PROFILE cA


    MicroEmacs uses local user configuration profiles to store user specific
    information. The user information may be stored in the MicroEmacs
    directory, or more typically in a users private directory. On login
    systems then the user name and user private directory location is
    automatically determined from the system.

    The user name identified by MicroEmacs is ls$user-name(5)lm$user-name(5)le this value may be
    set or re-defined using the environment variable ls$MENAME(5)lm$MENAME(5)le. On MS-DOS and
    early windows systems where there is no user login then then ls$MENAME(5)lm$MENAME(5)le
    may be defined in the environment.

    The location of the user information depends upon your platform and
    installation configuration. The private directory identified by MicroEmacs
    is ls$user-path(5)lm$user-path(5)le this location may be changed by defining the environment
    variable ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le.

    Microsoft Windows users may use the lsme32.ini(8)lmme32.ini(8)le file to define MicroEmacs
    configuration path and name information.


cEUser Profile Files  cA


    Files contained in the user profiles typically include:-

    cC<name>cAcG.emfcA - The users start up profile - cC<user>cA.emf.  
    cC<name>cAcG.edfcA - The users spelling dictionary.  
    cC<name>cAcG.erfcA - The users registry configuration file.  

    These files are automatically set up by MicroEmacs. These files are
    established from the menu "cDToolscA -> cDUser SetupcA". The "cDSetup PathcA" item
    defines the location of the files, but must be MANUALLY included in the
    cG$MEPATHcA environment.


cECompany Profiles  cA


    Company profiles include standard files and extensions to the standard
    files which may be related to a company, this is typically cC<company>cA.emf
    where cC<company>cA is the name of the company.

    The directory may also include template files lsetf(8)lmetf(8)le files which defines
    the standard header template used in the files. Files in the cGcGcompanycAcA
    directory would over-ride the standard template files.

! 2 CompanyProfiles
cEcECOMPANY PROFILES cEcA


    This section describes how a company profile should be incorporated into
    MicroEmacs 2009. A company profile defines a set of extensions to
    MicroEmacs which encapsulate settings which are used on a company wide
    basis. This type of configuration is typically used with a networked
    (shared) installation. The company profile would typically include:-

    - Name of the company.
    - Standard header files including company copyright statements.
    - Standard file layouts
    - Company defined language extensions.


cELocation Of The Company Information  cA


    It is suggested that all of the company extensions applied to MicroEmacs
    2009 are performed in a separate directory location which shadows the
    MicroEmacs standard macro file directory. This enables the original files
    to be sourced if a user does not want to include the company files. This
    method also allows MicroEmacs to be updated in the future, whilst
    retaining the company files.

    The company files are generally placed in the cGcompanycA sub-directory
    described in the installation notes.


cEContent Of The Company Information  cA


    cDCompany macro filecA
    
       The company file is typically called by the company name (i.e.
       cGjasspa.emfcA) create a new company file. The file includes your company
       name and hook functions for any new file types that have been defined
       for the company, an example company file for cDJasspacA might be defined
       as:-

    cDOther Company Files cA
     
       Files defined on behalf of the company are included in the company
       directory. These would include:-

       * Template header files lsetf(8)lmetf(8)le.
       * Hook file definitions (hkXXX.emf) for company specific
         files, see lsadd-file-hook(2)lmadd-file-hook(2)le.
       * Extensions to the standard hook definitions (myXXX.emf) for

cEcEUSER PROFILES cEcA


    This section describes how a user profile should be incorporated into
    MicroEmacs 2009. A user profile defines a set of extensions to MicroEmacs
    which encapsulates settings which are used by an individual user.

    The user profile allows:-

    - Saving of the last session (history), allowing the next invocation
          of MicroEmacs 2009 to restore your previous session. The -c option
          to lsme(1)lmme(1)le restores a previous sessions buffers to the same state
          prior to exiting the editor.
    - Personalized spelling dictionaries.
    - Redefinition of MicroEmacs 2009 operation, allowing the editor to be
          tailored to an individual's requirements. Including the re-binding
          of keys, modification of the screen colors. Definition of personal
          macros etc.


cEIdentification  cA


    In order to identify a user MicroEmacs 2009 uses information in the system
    to determine the name of the user, and in turn the configuration to use.
    On all systems the value of the environment variable ls$MENAME(5)lm$MENAME(5)le takes
    priority over any other means of user identification. If this variable is
    not defined then the host system typically provides a mechanism to
    determine the current user. MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows systems present
    problems where a login prompt is not used.

    Each of the supported platforms are now described.

    cDUNIXcA
    
       The login name is determined from the cG/etc/passwdcA file and defines
       ls$user-name(5)lm$user-name(5)le. The environment variable ls$MENAME(5)lm$MENAME(5)le may be defined
       alter the default user configuration file name.

    cDDOScA
 
        MS-DOS typically has no concept of the user name. The user name may be
        defined in the cGautoexec.batcA file, choose a name of 8 characters or
        less, i.e. to fix the user name to cGfredcA then add the following line:-

              SET MENAME=fred


       Remember to re-boot the system before the new command takes effect.
       (see the next step, there is another change to cGautoexec.batcA).

    cDMicrosoft WindowscA

       Microsoft windows environments may, or may not, have login enabled. If
       login is enabled then ls$user-name(5)lm$user-name(5)le is set to the login user name. The
       login name may be overridden by setting the environment variable
       ls$MENAME(5)lm$MENAME(5)le this may be performed in the environment or through the
       lsme32.ini(8)lmme32.ini(8)le file.


cEShared Platforms  cA


    Platforms may share the same set of configuration files. Consider a system
    which may boot under MS-DOS, Windows '98, NT and Linux. Provided that the
    macro files are located on a file system that may be mounted by all of the
    other operating systems and the ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le and ls$MEPATH(5)lm$MEPATH(5)le are set
    appropriately to point to the users private MicroEmacs and system
    directories, then a single set of macro files may be shared across all
    platforms.


cEPersonal MicroEmacs Directory  cA


    The private user profile is stored in a separate directory. The directory
    that MicroEmacs uses is typically automatically created at start up, but
    may be created manually by the user. If the directory is to be placed in a
    special location then the ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le environment variable should be
    defined and set to point at this directory location.

    cDUNIXcA
    
       In the UNIX environment then the local directory is typically created
       in the users home directory obtained from the cG/etc/passwdcA file and is
       called cG~/.jasspacA. MicroEmacs will automatically look for this
       directory and set the ls$user-path(5)lm$user-path(5)le variable to this value. The
       location may be overridden by setting the environment variable
       ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le to reference a different directory location.

    cDDOScA
 
       For MS-DOS environments, there is typically no user directory, it is
       suggested that the user directory is created in the MicroEmacs
       directory, use the cG$MENAMEcA defined in the previous step i.e.

              mkdir c:\jasspa\fred


       Change or add the environment variable ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le in the
       cDautoexec.batcA to include the new directory i.e.

              SET MEUSERPATH=c:\jasspa\fred


    cDWindowscA

       In Microsoft Windows environment using Explorer 4.0 or later then a
       user application data directory exists (cG$APPDATAcA) and MicroEmacs will
       create a directory cGjasspacA in this directory location to hold private
       data. If there is no such data area then all user configuration is
       stored in the executable directory location (or a sub-directory called
       ls$user-name(5)lm$user-name(5)le).

       The user data area ls$user-path(5)lm$user-path(5)le may be modified by creating a new
       directory and setting the environment variable ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le to point
       to this new directory location. The location be specified by a
       cDmeuserpathcA entry in the lsme32.ini(8)lmme32.ini(8)le file rather than setting the
       environment variable ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le.


cECreating Your Profile  cA


    On starting MicroEmacs for the first time then the user is guided through
    the configuration file setup to create any local configuration files. Once
    set up then MicroEmacs may be configured using the lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le dialog:-

        Tools -> User Setup


cEThe User Profile  cA


    Files created in the user directory include:-

    - Setup registry and previous session history ls$user-name(5)lm$user-namele.erf (see
       lserf(8)lmerf(8)le). This stores the user-setup settings and the context from
          previous edit sessions.
    - Users start-up file ls$user-name(5)lm$user-namele.emf (see lsemf(8)lmemf(8)le). This is typically
          referred to as "user.emf" in the documentation and means the users
          private MicroEmacs macro file. The user may make local changes to
          MicroEmacs in this file, this may include definition of new key
          bindings, defining new hook functions etc. You should override the
          standard MicroEmacs settings from your start-up file rather than
          modifying the standard MicroEmacs files.
    - Personal spelling dictionary cGlsdp_lang_.edfcA (see lsedf(8)lmedf(8)le). Multiple
          spelling dictionaries may be created, one for each language. Any
          words that are added to the spelling dictionary are stored in these
          files.

    In addition to the above, if new private macro files are constructed then
    they should be added to this directory (if they are not global to the
    company).

! 2 Interfacing
cEcEINTERFACING cEcA


    This sections describes how MicroEmacs 2009 may be interfaced to external
    components.


cEShells  cA


    A shell window may be opened within the context of the editor using the
    command lsishell(3)lmishell(3)le, whereby an interactive command shell is presented
    within a buffer.

    In the Microsoft Windows environment a cDcygwincA UNIX style BASH shell may be
    realised with the lscygwin(3)lmcygwin(3)le command.


cEDebugger  cA


    Within the UNIX environment the GNU cDgdb(1)cA or native UNIX cDdbx(1)cA debuggers
    may be invoked from the editor using lsgdb(3)lmgdb(3)le or lsdbx(3)lmdbx(3)le. respectively This
    invokes the debugger and follows the debugging process in the editor
    window, automatically opening the source files as the debugger calls for
    them.


cEMicrosoft Developer Studio  cA


    In the Microsoft windows environment, the lsmemsdev(1)lmmemsdev(1)le DLL may be attached
    to the cDMicrosoft Developer StudiocA to enable MicroEmacs 2009 to be used in
    place of the in-built editor.


cEFile Searching  cA


    File searching is performed using cDgrep(1)cA using the lsgrep(3)lmgrep(3)le command. For
    Windows then the GNU grep utility is recommended, for MS-DOS then the
    DJGPP version of GNU grep is recommended.


cEFile Differencing  cA


    Differencing files, or directories is performed using the cDdiff(1)cA utility
    using the lsdiff(3)lmdiff(3)le command. For all platforms the GNU diff utility is
    recommended as this provides a comprehensive differencing that is not
    typically available with native UNIX diff utilities.


cETag Files  cA


    A cDtagcA capability exists (see lsfind-tag(2)lmfind-tag(2)le) such that source functions and
    alike may be located quickly using a cDtagscA file. The standard cDctags(1)cA
    format is used by MicroEmacs. The cDtagscA file itself may be generated by
    MicroEmacs 2009 from the menu (cCTools->XX Tools->Create Tags FilecA).
    Alternatively a cDtagscA file may be generated by the cDctags(1)cA utility. This
    is typically standard on UNIX platforms. For Windows and DOS platforms
    then the cDExuberant CtagscA is recommended, this is available from:-

       ` http://darren.hiebert.com`

    A MicroEmacs 2009 compatible tags file may be generated using the command
    line "`ctags -N --format=1 ."` cataloging the current directory. To generate
    cDtagscA for a directory tree then use cG`ctags -NR --format=1 .`cA. Refer to the
    cDExuberant CtagscA documentation for a more detailed description of the
    utility.


cECompilation  cA


    Compilation is performed using the lscompile(3)lmcompile(3)le command. This invokes a
    command shell, typically using cDmake(1)cA to initiate a build sequence.


cEClient-Server  cA


    The lsClient-Server(2)lmClient-Serverle interface allows other client applications to inject
    commands into an already existing MicroEmacs 2009 session (the server),
    thereby controlling the editor remotely. This is typically used to inject
    new files into the editor to be presented to the user.

    The cCClient-ServercA interface is available in both the UNIX and Microsoft
    Windows environments. This mechanism is used in the Microsoft windows
    environment by the lsmemsdev(1)lmmemsdev(1)le DLL to attach the cDMicrosoft Developer StudiocA
    to MicroEmacs 2009. This may be used with similar effects within the UNIX
    environments from the X-Window managers desktop in addition to other
    utilities such as cDTkDesk(1)cA.


cECommand Line Filer  cA


    MicroEmacs may be invoked as a command filter in it's own right, macro
    scripts have been developed to perform a cDdos2unix(1)cA conversion operation,
    generate tags files etc. See lsCommand Line FilterslmCommand Line Filtersle.

! 2 Client-Server
cEcECLIENT-SERVER cEcA


    This sections describes how MicroEmacs 2009 may be interfaced to external
    components through the cDClient-ServercA interface.

    The cDClient-ServercA interface of MicroEmacs 2009 provides a capability for
    other applications to inject commands into a running version of the
    editor, which are interpreted and executed. The interface is only
    available on multi-tasking operating systems such as UNIX and Microsoft
    Windows; it is not available on MS-DOS systems. 

    Within the following discussions, the cDServercA is a running version of the
    MicroEmacs 2009 editor; the cDclientcA is the application (or shell script)
    that communicates a new command to the cCservercA.

    The cDClient-ServercA interface may provide a bidirectional interface such
    that a cCclientcA may submit a command to the cCservercA and may also retrieve a
    response to that command.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDClient-ServercA interface operates by making an external interface
    available which is continually monitored by the cCservercA. The external
    interface may be provided by a file, named pipe or socket (depending upon
    the platform) with a well know location in the file system. Typically two
    files are provided, an input file into which the cCclientcA writes commands
    (cC$TEMPcAcD/mecA_$MENAME_cD.cmdcA); and an output file where responses to those
    commands my be read (cC$TEMPcAcD/mecA_$MENAME_cD.rspcA).

    Within MicroEmacs, the client server interface appears as a hidden
    lsipipe-shell-command(2)lmipipe-shell-command(2)le buffer, with the name *server*. Commands are
    received through this buffer and responses are written back to the buffer.


cEClient Commands  cA


    cCClientscA may write directly to the cCcommandcA through the use of explicit
    embedded code, or may use a lsme(1)lmme(1)le invocation with the cD-mcA option. Commands
    to the client interface take the form "cDC:<client>:<command>cA".

    cC<client>cA
    
       cC<client>cA is an identification string that may be used to identify the
       client, this information may be used when the command is handled to
       interpret the command if some special client specific action is
       required.

    cC<command>cA
      
       The cC<command>cA is an editor command (or macro) of the given name with
       any arguments. Standard command escape sequences must be adhered to.
       i.e. to write cG`Hello World`cA on the message line then a client may
       issue the command:-

              me -m "C:<client>:ml-write \"Hello world\""


       A new line character may be included in the string using cG\\ncA, if the
       message is not terminated with a new line then on is automatically
       added. The cCclient-servercA interface is typically used to load a file,
       this may be performed as follows:-

              me -m "C:<client>:find-file \"/path/foo.bar\""


       The absolute path is specified in this type of transaction as the
       current working directory of the active MicroEmacs session is unknown.
       The cD-mcA option de-iconize's the existing editor session and bring it to
       the foreground.


cEClient Responses  cA


    Responses from cCclientcA commands are written to the response file, responses
    take a similar form to cCclientcA commands except they are prefixed by an cDRcA,
    i.e. "cDR:<client>:<data>cA".

    As multiple cCclientscA may be utilizing the cCclient-servercA mechanism then the
    cC<client>cA sting passed in the command is typically returned in the response
    to allow the cCclientcA to identify it's own response (rather than any other
    cCclientscA. It is the cCclientscA responsibility that this string is unique in
    order that it may be differentiated. 

    The returned cC<data>cA format is undefined and would be generated by a macro
    command used to handle the cCclientcA command; sufficient to say that the data
    should exist on a single line.


cEServer Side  cA


    On the cCservercA side, the cDClient-ServercA interface is managed like an
    lsipipe-shell-command(2)lmipipe-shell-command(2)le using the hidden buffer *server* (as previously
    mentioned).

    The cCClient-ServercA interface is enabled from the lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le interface,
    the user setting of the interface is confirmed by checking bit cG0x20000cA of
    the ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le variable.

    The client server interface is typically initialized within the cGme.emfcA
    initialization file, whereby the cCipipecA input handler is bound to the
    client pipe buffer and the buffer is hidden, so it is not available when
    the buffers are swapped. (Note that the client buffer may be explicitly
    interrogated using lsnext-buffer(2)lmfind-bufferle cG*server*cA). The client handler is installed
    as follows:-

sB
          ; Setup the Client Server
          !if &band $system 0x20000
              define-macro-file meserver server-input
              find-buffer "*server*"
              set-variable :last-line 2
              set-variable :client-list ":"
              set-variable $buffer-ipipe server-input
              beginning-of-buffer
              goto-alpha-mark  "I"
              -1 find-buffer "*server*"
          !endif

sA
    This binds a MicroEmacs macro called cCserver-inputcA to handle the client
    commands as they arrive on the input, an lsgoto-alpha-mark(2)lmalpha-markle is used to record the
    processed position at the end of the buffer. The pipe handler itself
    decodes the client request and executes it. The default handler supplied
    with MicroEmacs 2009 is defined within the macro file cGmeserver.emfcA

    Responses to the client are inserted into the response file by writing
    directly into the ipipe buffer (cG*server*cA) using the lsipipe-write(2)lmipipe-write(2)le
    command. It is the calling macros responsibility to ensure that the
    response string adheres to the format outlined above in the previous
    sections.


cENOTES cA


    It is not possible to kill the cG*server*cA buffer, and lsipipe-kill(2)lmipipe-kill(2)le is
    ignored within the context of the buffer.


cEFILES cA


    cGmeserver.emfcA - Default Client-Server ipipe handler.  
    cC$TEMP/me$MENAME.cmdcA - Command file.  
    cC$TEMP/me$MENAME.rspcA - Response file.


cEBUGS cA


    The first MicroEmacs 2009 session that executes becomes the editor server,
    additional editor sessions that are executed do not become server
    processes. In the event that the cCservercA editor is terminated, any other

cEcEREGULAR EXPRESSIONS cEcA


    Regular Expressions are used in the search (and replace) operations. The
    following notes are applicable when lsmagic(2m)lmmagic(2m)le mode is enabled.


cEOverview  cA


    A "cCregular expressioncA" (or "cCregexcA", or "cCpatterncA") is a text string that
    describes some (mathematical) set of strings. A regex cDRcA "cCmatchescA" a string
    cDScA if cDScA is in the set of strings described by cDRcA.

    Some regular expressions match only one string, i.e., the set they
    describe has only one member. For example, the regular expression cCcGfoocAcA
    matches the string cCcGfoocAcA and no others. Other regular expressions match
    more than one string, i.e., the set they describe has more than one
    member. For example, the regular expression cCcGf*cAcA matches the set of
    strings made up of any number (including zero) of cCcGfcAcAs. As you can see,
    some characters in regular expressions match themselves (such as cCcGfcAcA) and
    some don't (such as cCcG*cAcA); the ones that do not match themselves instead
    let you specify patterns that describe many different strings.


cESyntax of Regular Expressions  cA


    Regular expressions have a syntax in which a few characters are special
    constructs and the rest are "cCordinarycA". An ordinary character is a simple
    regular expression which matches that same character and nothing else. The
    special characters are cCcG$cAcA, cCcG^cAcA, cCcG.cAcA, cCcG*cAcA, cCcG+cAcA, cCcG?cAcA, cCcG[cAcA, cCcG]cAcA and cCcG\cAcA. Any
    other character appearing in a regular expression is ordinary, unless a
    cCcG\cAcA precedes it.

    For example, cCcGfcAcA is not a special character, so it is ordinary, and
    therefore cCcGfcAcA is a regular expression that matches the string cCcGfcAcA and no
    other string. (It does cDnotcA match the string cCcGffcAcA.) Likewise, cCcGocAcA is a
    regular expression that matches only cCcGocAcA. (When case distinctions are
    being ignored, these regexs also match cCcGFcAcA and cCcGOcAcA, but we consider this a
    generalization of "cCthe same stringcA", rather than an exception.)

    Any two regular expressions cGAcA and cGBcA can be concatenated. The result is a
    regular expression which matches a string if cGAcA matches some amount of the
    beginning of that string and cGBcA matches the rest of the string.

    As a simple example, we can concatenate the regular expressions cCcGfcAcA and
    cCcGocAcA to get the regular expression cCcGfocAcA, which matches only the string
    cCcGfocAcA. Still trivial. To do something nontrivial, you need to use one of
    the special characters. Here is a list of them.

    cD.cA (Period)

       is a special character that matches any single character except a
       newline. Using concatenation, we can make regular expressions like
       cCcGa.bcAcA, which matches any three-character string that begins with cCcGacAcA
       and ends with cCcGbcAcA.

    cD*cA (asterisk)

       is not a construct by itself; it is a postfix operator that means to
       match the preceding regular expression repetitively as many times as
       possible. Thus, cCcGo*cAcA matches any number of cCcGocAcAs (including no cCcGocAcAs).

       cCcG*cAcA always applies to the cDsmallestcA possible preceding expression.
       Thus, cCcGfo*cAcA has a repeating cCcGocAcA, not a repeating cCcGfocAcA. It matches cCcGfcAcA,
       cCcGfocAcA, cCcGfoocAcA, and so on.

       The matcher processes a cCcG*cAcA construct by matching, immediately, as
       many repetitions as can be found. Then it continues with the rest of
       the pattern. If that fails, backtracking occurs, discarding some of
       the matches of the cCcG*cAcA-modified construct in case that makes it
       possible to match the rest of the pattern. For example, in matching
       cCcGca*arcAcA against the string cCcGcaaarcAcA, the cCcGa*cAcA first tries to match all
       three cCcGacAcAs; but the rest of the pattern is cCcGarcAcA and there is only cCcGrcAcA
       left to match, so this try fails. The next alternative is for cCcGa*cAcA to
       match only two cCcGacAcAs. With this choice, the rest of the regex matches
       successfully.

       cD+cA (plus) is a postfix operator, similar to cCcG*cAcA except that it must
       match the preceding expression at least once. So, for example, cCcGca+rcAcA
       matches the strings cCcGcarcAcA and cCcGcaaaarcAcA but not the string cCcGcrcAcA,
       whereas cCcGca*rcAcA matches all three strings.

    cD?cA (question mark)

       is a postfix operator, similar to cCcG*cAcA except that it can match the
       preceding expression either once or not at all. For example, cCcGca?rcAcA
       matches cCcGcarcAcA or cCcGcrcAcA; nothing else.

    cD[cA ... cD]cA

       is a "character set", which begins with cCcG[cAcA and is terminated by cCcG]cAcA.
       In the simplest case, the characters between the two brackets are what
       this set can match.

       Thus, cCcG[ad]cAcA matches either one cCcGacAcA or one cCcGdcAcA, and cCcG[ad]*cAcA matches
       any string composed of just cCcGacAcAs and cCcGdcAcAs (including the empty
       string), from which it follows that cCcGc[ad]*rcAcA matches cCcGcrcAcA, cCcGcarcAcA,
       cCcGcdrcAcA, cCcGcaddaarcAcA, etc.

       You can also include character ranges in a character set, by writing
       the starting and ending characters with a cCcG-cAcA between them. Thus,
       cCcG[a-z]cAcA matches any lower-case ASCII letter. Ranges may be intermixed
       freely with individual characters, as in cCcG[a-z$%.]cAcA, which matches any
       lower-case ASCII letter or cCcG$cAcA, cCcG%cAcA or period.

       The word and digit special characters (i.e. cG\wcA, cG\lcA, etc.) are
       recognized within the character set.

       To include a cCcG]cAcA in a character set, you must make it the first
       character. For example, cCcG[]a]cAcA matches cCcG]cAcA or cCcGacAcA. To include a cCcG-cAcA,
       write cCcG-cAcA as the first or last character of the set, or put it after a
       range. Thus, cCcG[]-]cAcA matches both cCcG]cAcA and cCcG-cAcA.

       To include cCcG^cAcA in a set, put it anywhere but at the beginning of the
       set.

       When you use a range in case-insensitive search, you should write both
       ends of the range in upper case, or both in lower case, or both should
       be non-letters. The behavior of a mixed-case range such as cCcGA-zcAcA is
       somewhat ill-defined, and it may change in future Emacs versions.

    cD[^cA ... cD]cA

       cCcG[^cAcA begins a "cCcomplemented character setcA", which matches any
       character except the ones specified. Thus, cCcG[^a-z0-9A-Z]cAcA matches all
       characters *cDexceptcA* letters and digits.

       cCcG^cAcA is not special in a character set unless it is the first
       character. The character following the cCcG^cAcA is treated as if it were
       first (in other words, cCcG-cAcA and cCcG]cAcA are not special there).

       A complemented character set can match a newline, unless newline is
       mentioned as one of the characters not to match. This is in contrast
       to the handling of regexs in programs such as cDgrep(1)cA.

    cD^cA (caret)

       is a special character that matches the empty string, but only at the
       beginning of a line in the text being matched. Otherwise it fails to
       match anything. Thus, cCcG^foocAcA matches a cCcGfoocAcA that occurs at the
       beginning of a line.

    cD$cA (dollar)

       is similar to cCcG^cAcA but matches only at the end of a line. Thus, cCcGx+$cAcA
       matches a string of one cCcGxcAcA or more at the end of a line.

    cD\\cA (backslash)

       has two functions: it quotes the special characters (including cCcG\cAcA),
       and it introduces additional special constructs.

       Because cCcG\cAcA quotes special characters, cCcG\$cAcA is a regular expression
       that matches only cCcG$cAcA, and cCcG\[cAcA is a regular expression that matches
       only cCcG[cAcA, and so on.

       cDNote:cA for historical compatibility, special characters are treated as
       ordinary ones if they are in contexts where their special meanings
       make no sense. For example, cCcG*foocAcA treats cCcG*cAcA as ordinary since there
       is no preceding expression on which the cCcG*cAcA can act. It is poor
       practice to depend on this behavior; it is better to quote the special
       character anyway, regardless of where it appears.

       For the most part, cCcG\cAcA followed by any character matches only that
       character. However, there are several exceptions: two-character
       sequences starting with cCcG\cAcA that have special meanings. The second
       character in the sequence is always an ordinary character when used on
       its own. Here is a table of cCcG\cAcA constructs.

       cD\|cA (bar)

        specifies an alternative. Two regular expressions A and B with
         '\|' in between form an expression that matches some text if
         either A matches it or B matches it. It works by trying to match
         A, and if that fails, by trying to match B.

        Thus, 'foo\|bar' matches either 'foo' or 'bar' but no other
         string.

        '\|' applies to the largest possible surrounding expressions. Only
         a surrounding '\( ... \)' grouping can limit the grouping power of
        '\|'.

        Full backtracking capability exists to handle multiple uses of  '\|'.

       cD\(cA ... cD\)cA
     
        is a grouping construct that serves three purposes:

        * To enclose a set of '\|' alternatives for other
          operations. Thus, '\(foo\|bar\)x' matches either 'foox'
          or 'barx'.
        * To enclose a complicated expression for the postfix
          operators '*', '+' and '?' to operate on. Thus,
          'ba\(na\)*' matches 'bananana', etc., with any (zero or
          more) number of 'na' strings.
        * To record a matched substring for future reference. This
          last application is not a consequence of the idea of a
          parenthetical grouping; it is a separate feature that is
          assigned as a second meaning to the same '\( ... \)'
          construct. In practice there is no conflict between the
          two meanings.

       'cD\DcA'
       
         matches the same text that matched the Dth occurrence of a `\( ...
          \)' construct.

        After the end of a '\( ... \)' construct, the matcher remembers
         the beginning and end of the text matched by that construct. Then,
         later on in the regular expression, you can use '\' followed by
         the digit D to mean "match the same text matched the Dth time by
         the '\( ... \)' construct."
         
        The strings matching the first nine '\( ... \)' constructs
         appearing in a regular expression are assigned numbers 1 through 9
         in the order that the open-parentheses appear in the regular
         expression. So you can use '\1' through '\9' to refer to the text
         matched by the corresponding '\( ... \)' constructs.
         
        For example, '\(.*\)\1' matches any newline-free string that is
         composed of two identical halves. The '\(.*\)' matches the first
         half, which may be anything, but the '\1' that follows must match
         the same exact text.
         
        If a particular '\( ... \)' construct matches more than once
         (which can easily happen if it is followed by '*'), only the last
         match is recorded.

       cG\cA`

        matches the empty string, but only at the beginning of the buffer
         or string being matched against.
         
        NOTE: This currently only matches the start of the current line -
         it does not match the start of the buffer.

        cG\'cA
     
        matches the empty string, but only at the end of the buffer or
         string being matched against.

        NOTE: This currently only matches the end of the current line - it
         does not match the end of the buffer.

       cG\=cA
     
        matches the empty string, but only at point.

       cG\<cA
    
        matches the empty string, but only at the beginning of a word.
         '\<' matches at the beginning of the buffer only if a
         word-constituent character follows.

       cG\>cA
     
        matches the empty string, but only at the end of a word. '\>'
         matches at the end of the buffer only if the contents end with a
         word-constituent character.

       cG\acA
     
        matches any alpha characters.

       cG\AcA
     
        matches any non-alpha characters.

       cG\bcA
    
        matches the empty string, but only at the beginning or end of a
         word. Thus, '\bfoo\b' matches any occurrence of 'foo' as a
         separate word. '\bballs?\b' matches 'ball' or 'balls' as a
         separate word. '\b' matches at the beginning or end of the buffer
         regardless of what text appears next to it.

       cG\BcA
    
        matches the empty string, but *not* at the beginning or end of a
         word.

       cG\dcA

        matches any digit character.

       cG\DcA

        matches any non-digit character.

       cG\hcA
     
        matches any hexadecimal digit character.

       cG\HcA
     
        matches any non-hexadecimal character.

       cG\lcA
     
        matches any lowercase word-constituent character. The syntax table
         determines which characters these are.

       cG\LcA
    
        matches any character that is not a lowercase word-constituent.

       cG\mcA
     
        matches any alphanumeric characters

       cG\McA
     
        matches any non alphanumeric characters.

       cG\scA
     
        matches any white-space character, including new-line.

       cG\ScA
     
        matches any character that is not white-space.

       cG\ucA
    
        matches any uppercase word-constituent character. The syntax table
         determines which characters these are.

       cG\UcA
     
        matches any character that is not a uppercase word-constituent.

       cG\wcA
    
        matches any word-constituent character. The syntax table
         determines which characters these are.

       cG\WcA

        matches any character that is not a word-constituent.

       cG\{N,M\}cA
     
        Matches an integer number of the previous item, where N and M are
         integer constants interpreted as follows:-
        
        \{N\}
             The preceeding item is matched exactly N times.
        
        \{N,\}
             The preceeding item is matched N or more times.
        
        \{N,M\}
             The preceeding item is matched at least N times, but no more
             than M times.
        
        \{,M\}
             The preceeding item is optional and is matched at most M
             times.

    The constructs that pertain to words and syntax are controlled by the
    setting of the syntax table.


cESyntax of Replacement Expressions  cA


    A regular expression replacement, lsquery-replace-string(2)lmquery-replace-string(2)le command (with
    lsmagic(2m)lmmagic(2m)le mode enabled), replaces exact matches for a single string or
    pattern. The replacement pattern may be a constant; it may also refer to
    all or part of what is matched by the regular expression search string.

    cD\&cA
    
       In the replacement pattern, cD\&cA stands for the entire match being
       replaced. (as does cG\0cA).

    cD\DcA

       In the replacement pattern, where cDDcA is a digit 1-9, stands for
       whatever matched the Dth parenthesized grouping (cG\( .. \)cA) in search
       pattern. To include a cCcG\cAcA in the text to replace with, you must enter
       cCcG\\cAcA. For example,

              M-x query-replace-string<RET> c[ad]+r <RET> \&-safe <RET>


       replaces (for example) cGcGcadrcAcA with cGcGcadr-safecAcA and cGcGcddrcAcA with
       cGcGcddr-safecAcA.

              M-x query-replace-string<RET> \(c[ad]+r\)-safe <RET> \1 <RET>


       performs the inverse transformation.

       cD\0cA
       is a special case, this represents the whole of the search pattern,
       it is equivalent to cD\&cA.

    cD\ccAcCDcA

       In the replacement pattern capitalizes the string, where cCDcA is a digit
       cG0-9cA or cG&cA, stands for whatever matched the Dth parenthesized grouping
       (cG\(..\)cA) in search pattern.

    cD\lcAcCDcA

       In the replacement pattern down-cases the string, where cDDcA is a digit
       cG0-9cA of cG&cA, stands for whatever matched the Dth parenthesized grouping
       (cG\(..\)cA) in search pattern.

    cD\ucAcCDcA

       In the replacement pattern up-cases the string, where cDDcA is a digit cG0-9cA
       or cG&cA, stands for whatever matched the Dth parenthesized grouping
       (cG\(..\)cA) in search pattern.


cESearching and Case  cA


    Searching may be either case sensitive or case insensitive, and is
    controlled by the lsexact(2m)lmexact(2m)le mode. When cCexactcA mode is enabled (default) the
    then searches are case sensitive; disabled then case is ignored. The
    lsexact(2m)lmexact(2m)le mode is set on a per-buffer basis.


cENOTES cA


    The search engine searches for the longest string that matches a given
    pattern, the longest pattern is sometimes the pattern that is not actually
    required. For instance, consider searching for an HTML bracket set. The
    simplest search is:-

         M-x search-forward "<.*>"

    Unfortunately, this pattern is not specific enough, given an HTML line:-
 
        <a href="www.jasspa.com">Jasspa Site</a>

    Then the pattern matched is actually the whole line as the cG.*cA matches
    everything to the last cG>cA, this is the longest string. To rectify the
    pattern then we must be more specific, the correct search pattern to use
    in this instance is:-

        M-x search-forward "<[^>]*>"


    In this case we match any character excluding the closing character, this
    guarantees that we always find the shortest string match. A search of our
    HTML line locates two separate instances of the regular expression <a
    href="www.jasspa.com"> and cG</a>cA.


cEHISTORY cA


    As of March 2005 then the existing Emacs search string syntax of cGcG\s?cAcA and
    cGcG\S?cAcA has been discarded in favor of Perl's simpler syntax of cGcG\scAcA and
    cGcG\ScAcA for a whitespace character class. Added new character classes cGcG\dcAcA =
    digits, cGcG\DcAcA != digits cGcG\hcAcA = hexdigits cGcG\HcAcA != hexdigits cGcG\lcAcA = lowercase
    cGcG\LcAcA != lowercase cGcG\ucAcA = uppercase and cGcG\UcAcA != uppercase. The regular
    expression replacement string characters include cGcG\c#cAcA cGcG\l#cAcA and cGcG\u#cAcA to

! 2 Build
cEcEBUILD cEcA

cEBuild since 2024 cA

    The  version  which is on Github  should be build using the  Makefile in the
    root folder of the github project named  linux32gcc.gmk,  macos32gcc.gmk and
    win32mingw.gmk  (this currently  supports  crosscompiling on Linux using the
    Mingw version of the Gcc compiler.
     
    The following executables can be build.
    
    - cDmeccA  - for  Linux,  MacOS and  Windows - a  terminal  only  version  of
             MicroEmacs  09 which needs the Macro files in a separate  folder for
             full functionality
      
    - cDmewcA  - for MacOS, Linux and Windows - a Window (X11) based application
             without  console access,  this requires as well the installed Macro
             files, for MacOS and installation of  XQuartz is required
             
    - cDmecwcA - for  Linux  and  MacOS - a MicroEmacs 09 version  which runs as a
             X-Windows application but can be used as well as a terminal application 
             if the command line flag cGmecw -ncA is used, this requires as well the
             installed Macro files and for MacOS the XQuartz package
    
    - cDbfscA  - a console  application  which  allows  to  create  standalone
             executables out of cCmeccA, cCmewcA and cCmecwcA where the macro files are
             embedded within the executables, as well user macros, the help file
             and dictionaries can be added to the standalone file if the user 
             desires

    - cDmecbcA - a bfs  based  standalone executable build from the cCmeccA exectuable,
             the Macro files, the help file and the American dictionary

    - cDmewbcA - a bfs based standalone  executable  build from the cCmewcA
             or cCmecwcA (Linux, MacOS)  exectuable,  the Macro files, the help file
             and the American dictionary

    - cDmecwbcA - a bfs based standalone  executable  build from the cCmecwcA
             (Linux, MacOS)  exectuable,  the Macro files, the help file
             and the  American  dictionary,  For Windows no such  version can be
             build as applications can be either Console or Window based but not
             both

cEBuilding the Console Version (mec and mecb) cA

    To build the latest  developer  version  from Github you might start with an
    install of the following tools and libraries:
      
    Linux: git, gcc, make, libz and libncurses libraries  
    Mac: brew (package manager), gcc and make  
    Windows: msys2 (Linux like toolchain), gcc, make, libncurses and libz  

    For a Debian based Linux system like Ubuntu, Linux Mint or MX Linux the
    install steps are then like this:
    
          ### install packages
          sudo apt install git build-essential libz-dev libncurses-dev
          ### fetch repo
          git clone https://github.com/mittelmark/microemacs.git
          cd microemacs
          ### build  mec terminal executable
          make -f linux32gcc.gmk mec  
          ### build  bfs terminal executable
          make -f linux32gcc.gmk bfs/bin
          ### build  mecb terminal executable
          make -f linux32gcc.gmk mecb
            
    You should then have a file like  cCmecb-0912XX-linux-KERNEL-DISTRO-VERSION.bincA
    in the current folder. The uppercase letters are replaced with the ME version
    number and the operating system properties.
    
    For Red Hat systems the required  developer  libraries  are  cCzlib-develcA  and
    cCncurses-develcA.
    
    Hint: the three build steps can be as well done with one command line:
    
          make -f linux32gcc.gmk mec bfs/bin mecb
          
    TODO: MacOS and Windows (with msys2) build explanations
    
cEBuilding the GUI Version (mew/mecw and mewb/mecwb) cA

    To  build  the  GUI  version  for  X-Windows  or the  Windows  GUI you  need
    additional libraries for your platforms:
    
    Linux: libxt-dev (Debian based systems) or libXt-devel (Red Hat systems)
    
    You can then compile the mecw and mewb executables like this
    
          make -f linux32gcc.gmk mew mewb

    You should then have a file like  cCmewb-0912XX-linux-KERNEL-DISTRO-VERSION.bincA in the
    current folder
    
    TODO: build MacOS, Windows (with msys2) instructions, the commands are:
    
    MacOS:
    
          make -f macos32gcc.gmk mec bfs/bin mecb
          make -f macos32gcc.gmk mew mewb

    Windows (Cross compiling on Linux):
    
          make -f win32mingw.gmk mec bfs/bin mecb
          make -f win32mingw.gmx mew mewb
            
    For cCmecwbcA builds just replace cCmewcA with cCmecwcA and cCmewbcA with cCmecwbcA.
    
cEBuild before 2024 or for older Platforms cA

    This are the old build  instructions which you might try in case you like to
    build for other platforms like other Unix systems or even DOS.
    
    MicroEmacs 2009 may be compiled from the source files using the command
    shell build scripts cCbuildcA (UNIX Bourne Shell) or cCbuild.batcA (DOS/Windows).
    A default compile sequence may be achieved with a simple:

        build


    from the command line. The build script attempts to detect the host system
    and available compiler and build the editor.

    The build script recognizes the following options:-

    cD-CcA

       Build clean. Delete all of the object files.

    cD-dcA

       Build a debugging version, the output is cGmedcA (or cGmed32cA for 32-bit
       Windows versions).

    cD-hcA

       Display a simple help page

    cD-lcA cClogfilecA

       Redirect all compilation output to the cClogfilecA, this may not work on
       DOS or Windows systems.

    cD-lacA cClogfilecA

       Append all compilation output to the end of cClogfilecA, this may not work
       on DOS or Windows systems.

    cD-mcA cCmakefilecA

       Build using the specified makefile. over-riding the auto system
       detect. The supplied makefiles include:-

    cD-tcA cCtypecA

       Set the build type, where cCtypecA can be one of the following:

    * c Build a console only version (i.e. no window support), the
      output is mec (or mec32 on Windows).
    * w Build a windows only version (i.e. no console support),
      the output is mew (or mew32 on Windows).
    * cw Build a version which supports both console and windows,
      the output is mecw (or mecw32 on Windows).


cEMakefiles  cA


    The supplied makefiles are provided in two forms:-

    - cD.gmkcA - GNU make, using gcc.
    - cD.makcA - Native make, consistent with the compiler and platform.

    The makefiles are supplied with the following targets:-

    - cDallcA - Default build.
    - cDcleancA - Removes intermediate files.
    - cDspotlesscA - Removes intermediate files and any backup files.
    - cDmecA - Builds the default MicroEmacs executable.
    - cDmedcA - Builds a debugging version.
    - cDmeccA - Builds a console only version.
    - cDmewcA - Builds a windows only version.
    - cDmecwcA - Builds a version which supports both console and windows.
    - cDnecA - Builds NanoEmacs executable.


cEWINDOWS ENVIRONMENT cA


    The Windows environment is a little more difficult than UNIX because it
    does not have a good native command line environment. There are two
    Microsoft Developer options for building. If you have not purchased MS-DEV
    then use the FREE Borland compiler which runs on the command line.


cEMinGW Build  cA


    A collection of freely available and freely distributable Windows specific
    header files and import libraries combined with GNU toolsets that allow
    one to produce native Windows programs that do not rely on any 3rd-party C
    runtime DLLs. Available from http://www.mingw.org, cDmingwcA allows a
    Microsoft Windows version MicroEmacs to bu built and maintained.


cEMS-Dev GUI Build  cA


    MicroEmacs is supplied with a MS-Dev 6.x project for building. This has
    only been set up for debugging and has limited build options, it will also
    produce a large executable image. The MS-Windows images shipped by JASSPA
    are built using the command line build environment which is detailed in a
    later section.


cEMS-Dev Command Line Build  cA


    The command line build with MS-Dev is a little messy to set up, in the
    following sections we discuss MS-Dev 6.x under Windows 2000. There will be
    differences with different operating systems versions, different install
    paths and different versions of the MS-Dev toolkit. Use the following
    information as an outline ONLY, JASSPA will not take responsibility for
    the configuration of the command line environment, if in doubt then use
    the GUI builder.

    To run cDnmake(1)cA from a DOS box then the MS-Dev compiler tools must be
    available in the command path. The MS-Dev kit V6.x is supplied with the
    necessary file to set up the path which is called cGVCVARS32.BATcA and is
    typically located in directory:

        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin


    This should be run first and then the command line make files may be run
    using nmake i.e. to build ME:-

        nmake -f win32v6.mak me


    To build NE:-

        nmake -f win32v6.mak ne


    To clean up after:-

        nmake -f spotless


    If you are going to perform a lot of command line building then it is
    easier to set up the environment and not have to run cGVCVARS32.BATcA every
    time you compile.

    You can add the variables to your environment, you will need to expand the
    cGVCVARS32.BATcA script and then add the results. The following example is for
    MS-Dev 6.0 under W2K, the settings will differ depending on what O/S
    variant you are running and where you have installed software. The
    following ONLY serves as an example, you need to tailor for your
    installation.

    - To set up the variables then cDStartcA -> cDSettingscA -> cDControlcA cDPanelcA
          which displays the Control Panel items.
    - Select cDSystemcA -> cDAdvancedcA -> cDEnvironment variablescA
    - In cDUser Variables forcA cC<User>cA then cDNew...cA or cDEdit...cA the cGPATHcA
        variable. Add the command line tools execution paths to the
        environment variable, this will be something like the following (but
        without newlines):-

                  Variable Name:  PATH
                  Variable Value: %PATH%;
                                  C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~3\Common\msdev98\BIN;
                                  C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~3\VC98\BIN;
                                  C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~3\Common\TOOLS\WINNT;
                                  C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~3\Common\TOOLS;

    - Similarly add the cGINCLUDEcA variable:-

                  Variable Name:  INCLUDE
                  Variable Value: C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~3\VC98\ATL\INCLUDE;
                                  C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~3\VC98\INCLUDE;
                                  C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~3\VC98\MFC\INCLUDE;
                                  %INCLUDE%

    - Similarly add the cGLIBcA variable:-

                  Variable Name:  LIB
                  Variable Value: C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~3\VC98\LIB;
                                  C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~3\VC98\MFC\LIB;
                                  %LIB%

    - Accept the entries and close down the dialog. Start a new DOS command
       line and the variables should be set up ready for the build.


cENOTES cA


    Other UNIX ports should be fairly easy from the base set of ported
    platforms. If any new platform ports are performed by individuals then
    please submit the makefiles and any source changes back to JASSPA - see
    lsContact InformationlmContact Informationle.
! 2 localeSupport
cEcELOCALE SUPPORT cEcA


    Locale support within MicroEmacs handles the hardware and software
    configuration with respect to location, including:-

        Displayed Character Set
        Keyboard Support
        Word characters
        Spell Support

    There are many other locale problems which are not addressed in this help
    page. Supporting different locale configurations often requires specific
    hardware (a locale specific keyboard) and knowledge of the language and
    customs of the region. This makes it a very difficult area for one
    localized development team to support, as such, JASSPA rely heavily on the
    user base to report locale issues.


cENote on Names and IDs  cA


    The language name is not sufficient to identify a locale (Mexican Spanish
    is different to Spanish Spanish) neither is the country name (two
    languages are commonly used in Belgium), so before we've really started
    the first problem of what to call the locale has no standard answer! Call
    it what you like but please try to call it something meaningful so others
    may understand and benefit from your work.

    In addition, the cCinternal idcA and cCdata filecA names have a length limit of
    just four characters due to the cGcG8.3cAcA naming conversion of MS-DOS. The
    standard adopted by JASSPA MicroEmacs for the internal locale id is to
    combine the 2 letter ISO language name (ISO 639-1) with the 2 letter ISO
    country name (ISO 3166-1). Should the locale encompasses more than one
    country, then the most appropriate cCcountry idcA is selected.


cEDisplayed Character Set cA


    A character set is the mapping of an integer number to a display symbol
    (i.e. character). The ASCII standard defines a mapping of numbers to the
    standard English characters, this standard is well defined and accepted,
    as a result the character set rarely causes a problem for plain English.

    Problems occur when displaying characters found outside the ASCII
    standard, such as letters with accents, letters which are not Latin based
    (e.g. Greek alphabet) and graphical characters (used for drawing dialog
    boxes etc.). There are many different character sets to choose between and
    if the wrong character set is selected then the incorrect character
    translation is performed resulting in an incorrect character display. If
    the character display looks incorrect then first try changing the font and
    character-set setting, these can be configured using the platform page of
    lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le.

    If the problem persists (i.e. because the character set used to write the
    text is not supported on your current system) use the lscharset-change(3)lmcharset-change(3)le
    command to convert the text to the current character set.

    If your character-set is not supported then first make sure that
    MicroEmacs will draw all of the characters to be used. By default
    MicroEmacs does not draw some characters directly as the symbol may not be
    defined. When a character is not defined then there will typically be a
    gap or space in the text at the unknown character, in some cases there may
    be no space at all which will make it very hard to use. The
    lsinsert-symbol(3)lminsert-symbol(3)le command (Edit->Insert Symbol) is a good way of looking at
    which characters can be used with the current character set.

    For a character to be rendered (when in main text) or poked (drawn by
    lsscreen-poke(2)lmscreen-poke(2)le or lsosd(2)lmosd(2)le) is defined by the lsset-char-mask(2)lmset-char-mask(2)le command. The
    characters that are used when drawing MicroEmacs's window boarders or cDosdcA
    dialogs is set via the ls$box-chars(5)lm$box-chars(5)le and ls$window-chars(5)lm$window-chars(5)le variables.

    MicroEmacs attempts to improve the availability of useful graphics
    characters on Windows and UNIX X-Term interfaces. The characters between 0
    and 31 are typically control characters with no graphical representation
    (e.g. new-line, backspace, tab etc.) if bit 0x10000 of the ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le
    variable is set then MicroEmacs renders its own set of characters. These
    characters are typically used for drawing boxes and scroll-bars.

    With so many character sets, each with their own character mappings, then
    the problem of spelling dictionary support is also tied to the locale.
    MicroEmacs uses the ISO standard character sets (ISO 8859) internally for
    word and spelling support and therefore a mapping between the ISO standard
    and the user character set is required. This mapping is defined by using
    the cCcGMcAcA flag of the lsset-char-mask(2)lmset-char-mask(2)le command.

    The user may declare the current character set in the platform page of
    lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le. All the settings required for supporting each character set
    may be found in the cGcharset.emfcA macro file, so if your character set is
    not supported, this is the file to edit.


cEKeyboard Support cA


    The keyboard to character mapping is defined in the Start-Up page of
    lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le, where the keyboard may be selected from a list of known
    keyboards. If your keyboard is not present, or is not working correctly,
    then this section should allow you to fix the problem (please send JASSPA
    the fix).

    Most operating systems seem to handle keyboard mappings with the exception
    of MS-Windows which requires a helping hand. The root of the problems with
    MS-Windows is it's own locale character mappings which change the
    visibility status of the keyboard messages which conflict with Emacs
    keystroke bindings. To support key-bindings like cCcGC-tabcAcA or cCcGS-returncAcA a
    low level keyboard interface is required, but this can lead to strange
    problems with the more obscure keys, particularly with the cC`Alt Gr`cA
    accented letter keys. For example on American keyboards pressing cCcGC-#cAcA
    results in two cCcGC-#cAcA key events being generated, this peculiarity only
    occurs with this one key. On a British keyboard the same key generates a
    cCcGC-#cAcA followed by a cCcGC-\cAcA.

    This problem can be diagnosed using the ls$recent-keys(5)lm$recent-keys(5)le variable. Simply
    type an obvious character, e.g. cCcGAcAcA then the offending key followed by
    another obvious key (cCcGBcAcA), then look for this key sequence in the
    cD$recent-keyscA variable (use the lslist-variables(2)lmlist-variables(2)le or lsdescribe-variable(2)lmdescribe-variable(2)le
    command). So for the above British keyboard problem the recent-keys would
    be:

              B C-\\ C-# A


    ($recent-keys lists the keys backwards). Once you have found the key
    sequence generated by the key, the problem may be fixed using the
    lstranslate-key(2)lmtranslate-key(2)le to automatically convert the incorrect key sequence into
    the required key. For the problem above the following line is required:

sB
          translate-key "C-# C-\\" "C-#"

sA
    Note that once a key sequence has been translated everything, including
    cD$recent-keyscA, receive only the translated key. So if you a suspected a
    problem with the existing definition, change the keyboard type in
    cDuser-setupcA to cDDefaultcA so no translations are performed, quit and restart
    MicroEmacs before attempting to re-diagnose the problem.

    All the settings required for supporting each keyboard may be found in the
    cGkeyboard.emfcA macro file, so if your keyboard is not supported, this is the
    file you need to edit.


cEWord characters cA


    Word characters are those characters which are deemed to be part of a
    word, numbers are usually included. Many MicroEmacs commands use the
    'Word' character set such as lsforward-word(2)lmforward-word(2)le and lsupper-case-word(2)lmupper-case-word(2)le. The
    characters that form the word class are determined by the language being
    used and this can be set in the Start-Up page of lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le.

    If your language is not supported you will need to add it to the list and
    define the word characters, these settings may be found in the
    cGlanguage.emfcA macro file. The cCcGacAcA flag of command lsset-char-mask(2)lmset-char-mask(2)le is used
    to specify whether a character is part of a word, you must specify the
    uppercase letter and then the lowercase equivalent so the case conversion
    functions work correctly.

    A list of characters to be removed from the word character set is stored
    in the cD.set-char-mask.rm-charscA variable. This is done so that the language
    may be changed many times in the same session of MicroEmacs without any
    side effects (such as the expansion of the word character set to include
    all letters of all languages). This makes MicroEmacs ideal for writing
    multi-language documents.

    This may unfortunately be made a little more tricky by the requirement
    that this list must be specified in the most appropriate ISO standard
    character set (see cDDisplayed Character SetcA section). When extending the
    word character set the characters have to be mapped to the current
    character set which may not support all the required characters. For
    example in the PC-437 DOS character set there is an e-grave (`cGecA) but no
    E-grave so the E-grave is mapped to the normal E. As a result, if trying
    to write French text the case changing commands will behave oddly, for
    example:

              r`egle -> REGLE -> r`egl`e


    The conversion of all cCcGEcAcAs to '`cGecA' is an undesirable side effect of '`cGEcA'
    being mapped to cGEcA. This can be avoided by redefining the base letter again
    at the end of the word character list, for example:

sB
          set-char-mask "a" "`E`eEe"

sA
cESpell Support cA


    The current language is set using the Language setting on General page of
    lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le, if your required language is not listed you must first
    create the basic language support by following the guide lines in the Word
    Character section above. If you Language is listed, select it and enable
    it by either pressing cDCurrentcA or saving and restarting MicroEmacs. in a
    suitable test buffer run the lsspell-buffer(3)lmspelling checkerle, one of three things will
    happen:

    The cGSpelling CheckercA dialog opens and spelling is checked

       The spelling checker is supported by the current language and can be
       used (the rules and dictionaries have been downloaded and installed).

      Dialog opens with the following error message:

              Rules and dictionaries for language "XXXX"
                 are not available, please download.


       The spelling checker is supported by the current language but the
       required rules and dictionaries have not been downloaded. You should
       be able to download them from the JASSPA website, see lsContact InformationlmMicroEmacs - Contact InformationlelmContactln
       Once downloaded they must be placed in the MicroEmacs
       ls$search-path(5)lmsearch pathle, i.e. where the other macro files (like me.emf) are
       located.

      Dialog opens with the following error message:

              Language "XXXX" not supported!


       The spelling checker is not supported by the current language, see the
       following cDAdding Spell SupportcA section.


cEAdding Spell Support  cA


    To support a language MicroEmacs's spelling checker requires a base word
    dictionary and a set of rules which define what words can be derived from
    each base word in the dictionary. The concept and format of the word list
    and rules are compatible with the cDFree Software FoundationcA GNU cDispell(1)cA
    package.

    The best starting point is to obtain cDispellcA rules and word lists in plain
    text form, the web can usually yield these. Once these have been obtained
    the rules file (or affix file) must be converted to a MicroEmacs macro
    file calling the lsadd-spell-rule(2)lmadd-spell-rule(2)le command to define the rules. The rule
    file should be named "cGlsrcA_<lang-id>_cG.emfcA" where "cC<lang-id>cA" is the spelling
    language id, determined by the cD.spell.languagecA variable set in the
    cGlanguage.emfcA macro file.

    The cGspellutl.emfcA macro file contains the command cDspell-conv-aff-buffercA
    which will attempt to convert the buffer but due to formatting anomalies
    this process often goes wrong so using the command cDspell-conv-aff-linecA
    (also contained in cGspellutl.emfcA) to convert a single line is often
    quicker. See existing spelling rule files (cGlsr*.emfcA) for examples and help
    on command lsadd-spell-rule(2)lmadd-spell-rule(2)le.

    cDNotecA: the character set used by the rules should be the most appropriate
    ISO standard (see cDDisplayed Character SetcA section), this can make the
    process much more difficult if the current character set not compatible,
    if you are having difficulty with this please e-mail lsMicroEmacs - Contact InformationlmJASSPA Supportle.

    Once the rules have been created, create a dictionary for the language
    from the word lists, see help on command lsadd-dictionary(2)lmadd-dictionary(2)le. The dictionary
    file name should be "cGlsdmcA_<lang-id>_cG.edfcA", if the dictionary is large and
    can be split into two sections, a set of common words and a set of more
    obscure ones, create two dictionaries calling the dictionary containing
    obscure words "cGlsdxcA_<lang-id>_cG.edfcA" and the other as above.

    Once the generated word and dictionary files have been place in the
    MicroEmacs ls$search-path(5)lmsearch pathle, the spelling checker should find and use them.
    Please submit your generated support to MicroEmacs for others to benefit.

! 1 Patching
cEcEPATCHING cEcA


    This page describes how to patch a MicroEmacs installation with a later
    release without re-installing.


cEWindows  cA


    Windows requires careful patching in order not to disturb the registry
    settings The following procedure should be followed.

    - Move to the jasspa directory, cGc:\ProgramFiles\JASSPA\MicroemacscA.
    - COPY the executable cGme32.execA to a backup, you MUST copy the file
            otherwise the registry settings will change. DO NOT MOVE THE FILE.

                  copy me32.exe me32_2002_12.exe

    - Save the macros directory, these may be moved i.e.

                  rename macros macros_2002_12

    - Unpack and install the new Windows executable and COPY over the
      original executable that was previously backed up i.e.

                  copy c:\path-to-executable\me32-win32-20040108-rc1.exe me32.exe

    - Create a new macros directory and install the macros into this new
      directory, do this manually or using a utility like WINZip.

                  mkdir macros
                  cd macros
                  unzip c:\path-to\memacros-20040108-rc1.zip

    - The new version of MicroEmacs will now operate with the old
      installation environment. You may return to the old release by
      reversing the steps to patch the installation.


cEUNIX/Linux  cA


    For cD*NIXcA package installations then patching is a little easier. The steps
    are defined as follows:-

    - Move to the jasspa directory.

                  cd /opt/jasspa/bin

    - Save the original executable.

                  mv me me_200212

    - Unpack the new executable and make it executable.

                  gunzip me-sun-solaris-20040108-rc1.gz
                  mv me-sun-solaris-20040108-rc1 me
                  chmod a+x me

    - Save the existing macros directory.

                  cd /opt/jasspa
                  mv macros macros_200212

    - Create a new macros directory and install the new macros:-

                  mkdir macros
                  cd macros
                  unzip /path-to/memacros-20040108-rc1.zip

    - Installed packages are built with the install path built into the
      executable, this may be different from the patch version of the
      executable so the environment variable ls$MEINSTALLPATH(5)lm$MEINSTALLPATH(5)le may be
      defined in the environment with the macro installation search paths.

! 4 macroWriting
cEcEMACROS cEcA


    cDMicroEmacscA is based on a core set of built in commands and variables that
    provide a a basic set of functionality, almost all of the visible features
    of MicroEmacs are implemented or controlled by its macro language.  
    cDNanoEmacscA is quite simply this base set of commands of MicroEmacs with no
    macro support and provides a basic Emacs editor.

    MicroEmacs is extended with an interpreted script file that allows new
    commands to be defined using the base level commands and variables which
    is referred to as a Macro. Once a macro command has been defined then it
    appears as a built in command to the user, and as with the existing
    commands, may have a key binding to invoke the new command.

    In addition to the base commands, the macro language includes control
    statements and logical operators which allow loops and conditional command
    sequences to control the sequence of operations.


cEStarting to write Macros  cA


    For new users to MicroEmacs writing macros can be quite daunting, some of
    the macros shipped with MicroEmacs are complex and have evolved over many
    years. Beginners should start with simple macros which has verifiable
    output and can be performed interactively. This makes the task of writing
    and testing easier, some of the cCbehind the scenecA macros like the mouse
    driver and auto-spell checker are difficult to get working and requires a
    greater understanding of MicroEmacs and experience in macro debugging. 

    A good starting point is to try to write a macro to do something that you
    find yourself doing all the time, for example reread-file, write-region
    etc.

    cDEscape SequencescA

       The backslash character cCcG\cAcA is an escape sequence in MicroEmacs macro
       files, therefore any backslash character that appears in a macro
       command must be also escaped. i.e. '\' will become '\\' when placed in
       a macro file.

    cDEditor ControlcA

       Remember when you write a macro you are placing the editor in control
       of your macro, when testing a new macro then start a new MicroEmacs
       session or make sure that if things go wrong you will not loose any
       work. If you loose control of the editor then cDabortcA (cGC-gcA) will
       typically regain control again.


cEDeveloping your First Macro  cA


    In the following example then we walk through the steps to create a macro
    that saves a region of text to a file (i.e. the text between cDpointcA and
    cDmarkcA). The resultant macro will be called cDwrite-regioncA, note that this
    macro already exists in MicroEmacs.

    The first thing to do is walk through the macro that you wish to write
    interactively in MicroEmacs. Whilst doing this you should decide which
    approach to take and the commands (or keys) used. Our cDwrite-regioncA could
    either use narrows or copy the region to a temporary buffer, a decision
    has to be made which approach is best to use. Narrows would be more
    efficient but there are more complications (such as restoring edit mode,
    avoid changing the cDundocA stack etc.). For the moment then the temporary
    buffer approach is probably the best solution.

    Walking through the sequence of steps required to save a region of text
    then the following command sequence would be executed (assuming a marked
    up region has been selected):-

        esc w                       ; Copy the region.
        C-x b "tmp-buffer"          ; Create a new temporary buffer.
        C-y                         ; Yank copied region into temporary buffer.
        C-x C-w "write_region_file" ; Save the buffer to a file.
        C-x k RETURN                ; Kill the temporary buffer.


    This is a fairly easy sequence of steps, the history of key presses can be
    viewed in the variable ls$recent-keys(5)lm$recent-keys(5)le, the command lslist-variables(2)lmlist-variables(2)le
    includes this variable in its output.

    Macros are not written in key sequences, instead the commands associated
    with the key bindings are used. A key binding command name may be
    determined using lsdescribe-key(2)lmdescribe-key(2)le and lsdescribe-bindings(2)lmdescribe-bindings(2)le. Some command
    bindings include a numeric argument, the numeric argument is important
    (both the value and absence/presence of the argument) and can change the
    behavior of the command. cGC-upcA is not cDbackward-linecA, it is cC5cA cDbackward-linecA 
    to go back 5 lines, if you supply a numerical value to the command
    as well, e.g. cGesc 3 C-upcA you must multiply the user argument with
    the numerical argument of the binding:

        3 up   -> 3   'backward-line' -> 3 * 1 backward-line ->  3 backward-line
        3 C-up -> 3 '5 backward-line' -> 3 * 5 backward-line -> 15 backward-line


    Translating the keys that we used into commands then our cDwrite-regioncA
    process becomes:-

sB
          copy-region
          find-buffer "tmp-buffer"
          yank
          write-buffer "write_region_file"
          delete-buffer RETURN

sA
    cDTIP:cA
 
       If you are in an MicroEmacs macro buffer (e.g. cGfoo.emfcA) use the
       cDemf-quote-commandcA command (bound to cGA-qcA) to make this process trivial.
       This converts the key binding into a command which is inserted into
       the buffer.

    The obvious problem here is the last line, `delete-buffer RETURN`. When
    running interactively you can simply press RETURN to delete the current
    buffer however you cannot do this in a macro so you must explicitly
    specify the buffer name to delete:

sB
          delete-buffer  "write_region_file"

sA
    The the process of writing the buffer has the side effect of changing the
    buffer name to reflect the output file name, as cDdelete-buffercA follows the
    cDwrite-buffercA then the name will have changed.

    Correcting the delete buffer name, the sequence of commands is wrapped
    with a macro definition, which binds a name to the command sequence, and a
    terminator which terminates the macro.

sB
          define-macro write-region
              copy-region
              find-buffer "tmp-buffer"
              yank
              write-buffer "write_region_file"
              delete-buffer "write_region_file"
          !emacro

sA
    This macro works but is not very effective as the output filename has been
    fixed, this creates a file cGcGwrite_region_filecAcA in the MicroEmacs start up
    directory - probably not what is required. The specific macro that has
    been created must be made interactive, this means it must get filenames
    from the user, cope with a failure and the user doing silly things. So
    what must we cope with ? The list of defects is surprisingly long
    considering we are doing so little:

    1. The temp buffer used (cGcGtmp-buffercAcA) is not a temporary buffer,
       temporary buffers must always commence with a cCcG*cAcA and should be
       identifiable with the generating macro. cDNote:cA knowledge that a buffer
       is temporary allows MicroEmacs to discard content when shutting down
       without prompting the user to save.
    2.
       What happens if the cGcGtmp-buffercAcA already exists ?
    3.
       What happens if the cGcGwrite_region_filecAcA buffer already exists ?
    4.
       We need to get the filename to write from the user.
    5.
       What happens if the user aborts during the macro ?
    6.
       What happens if the write fails (disk full or file exists etc.) ?
    7.
       What happens if the user has the current buffer displayed in more than
       one window ?
    8.
       Does this fit in with other MicroEmacs commands amd macros ? Do we
       want to use this new command from another context ?


    The list of issues is a re-occurring theme, once you have got the hang of
    this it does become easier. In short reliable macros must:

    - Check inputs
    - Check outputs
    - Handle errors
    - Where appropriate handle an unexpected failure.

    The last one is really reserved for low level drivers (i.e. mouse,
    directory listings etc.) which must be bomb proof.


cEGeneralising Macros  cA


    In the previous section we have created a basic macro to save a region of
    text, in this section we look at that macro is transformed from a static
    sequence to commands to a fully interactive robust command. Reference
    should be made to lsmacroOverview(4)lmMicroEmacs Macro Language at a Glancele for a quick tour
    of the language syntax.


cE1. The temp buffer used is not a temporary buffer...  cA


    Forming a temporary buffer is simply a naming issue, temporary buffer
    names are simply started with a cGcG*cAcA, by convention for a simple buffer
    name then they are terminated with a cGcG*cAcA as well. The temporary buffer
    name should reflect the name of the original macro hence the buffer name
    should be something like cG*write-region-tmp*cA

sB
          define-macro write-region
              copy-region
              find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              yank
              write-buffer "write_region_file"
              delete-buffer "write_region_file"
          !emacro

sA
cE2. What happens if the 'tmp-buffer' already exists ?  cA


    Looking at the current implementation if the write fails the temporary
    buffer will be left lying around. This is very likely to happen and if it
    does then we will get the last region as well as the next region in the
    output file. The simple solution is to delete the temporary buffer first,
    our first attempt to correct this:

sB
          define-macro write-region
              copy-region
              delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              ....
          !emacro

sA
    Unfortunately this fails if the buffer does not exist, so we must tell
    MicroEmacs to ignore the failure by cDforcingcA the execution:

sB
          define-macro write-region
              copy-region
              !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              yank
              write-buffer "write_region_file"
              delete-buffer "write_region_file"
          !emacro

sA
cE3. What happens if the 'write_region_file' buffer already exists ?  cA


    If the cGwrite_region_filecA buffer already exists the buffer being written is
    renamed to cGwrite_region_file<1>cA rather than cGwrite_region_filecA and so
    the cDdelete-buffercA command will delete the wrong buffer. Therefore rather than
    delete an explicitly named buffer the environment variables are used to
    query the name of the current buffer. The variable ls$buffer-bname(5)lm$buffer-bname(5)le
    returns the current buffer's buffer name and may be used instead of an
    explicit name.

sB
          define-macro write-region
              copy-region
              !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              yank
              write-buffer "write_region_file"
              delete-buffer $buffer-bname
          !emacro

sA
    Macro variables may be used to get just about any information you could
    possibly want. For example ls$buffer-fname(5)lm$buffer-fname(5)le could be used after the
    cDbuffer-writecA to get the file name, ls$window-line(5)lm$window-line(5)le provides the current
    line number etc. See

        Help -> [Variable Glossary](Variable Glossary)

    for a full list of system variables. There are also cDMacro VariablescA
    (cG@cA,cG#cA,...) which are also very useful, e.g. lsCurrentBufferVariables(4)lm@wlle gives the text on the
    current line as a string, see the lsMacro Language GlossarylmMacro Language Glossaryle for a full list
    of these and other macro features such as functions and directives.


cE4. We need to get the destination filename from the user.  cA


    Getting input from the user is always dangerous, most macros run so
    quickly that the user will not have sufficient time to abort the process
    (cGC-gcA) and if they do there is not much that can be done. When collecting
    input from the user the macro must wait for some input, at this point the
    user can and should be able to abort the process which must be handled. If
    the user has not aborted the user still has this uncanny ability of doing
    the unexpected and the input has to be checked, better still get
    MicroEmacs to get the input and check it.

    There are two approaches to the input problem:

    - We get the filename ourselves and pass this to the cDwrite-buffercA
          command.
    - Make cDwrite-buffercA get the input from the user itself as the command
          would when run from the command key binding.

    We would need to use the first approach if we needed the entered value
    multiple times, in this case we are not so we can use the simpler second
    approach but for the sake of this document lets consider the first
    approach.

    First stab:

sB
          set-variable $write-region-file-name @ml "Write-region file"
          write-buffer $write-region-file-name

sA
    This does work but you really do not want to do this ! Consider what
    happens if the user aborts while entering the file name ? The user would
    be left in the cGcG*write-buffer-tmp*cAcA buffer and would have to clear up the
    mess themselves. This may be fixed by catching the abort from the input
    and deleting the buffer.

sB
          !force !force set-variable $write-region-file-name @ml "Write-region file"
          !if &not $status
              !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
              !abort
          !endif
          write-buffer $write-region-file-name

sA
    cDNOTE:cA
 
       The call to lsset-variable(2)lmset-variablele requires a double ls!force(4)lm!forcele, a single cD!forcecA
       allows a macro to continue after a failed command but not after a user
       interrupt (i.e. a cGC-gcA abort), to continue after this requires a double
       cD!forcecA.

    The second problem is with the input type, the lsMessageLineVariables(4)lm@mlle does not indicate that
    a file name is required. The type of input should be qualified to first
    check the input type and to provide other features such as file completion
    on file name entry. Specifying the input type correctly:

sB
          !force !force set-variable $write-region-file-name @ml04 "Write-region file"
          !if &not $status
              !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
              !abort
          !endif
          write-buffer $write-region-file-name

sA
    cDTIP:cA
 
       How did we find out about lsMessageLineVariables(4)lm@ml04le ? The best way to find out how to do
       something is find another macro (or command) that does something very
       similar and copy it, in this case the lsdiff(3)lmdiffle macro has to perform a
       similar operation. If you cannot find anything then look in the
       command documents, the documents generally provide this sort of
       information (for example see ls@ml(4)lm@ml(4)le). If all else fails then use the
       News Group, somebody will be able to provide an answer to your
       question.

    In progressing through the example we have used the basic system variables
    (cG$varcA) as they are simple. Other variables exist: user (cG%varcA), buffer
    (cG:varcA) or command (cG.varcA). All of the previously mentioned variables use
    valuable system resource and consideration should be given as to whether
    the value is required once the macro has completed execution. In our case
    the file name is temporary and is not required outside of the scope of the
    macro, rather than waste memory then a register variable is preferred as
    they have zero cost and execute faster than the other variables.
    Re-writing the macro with register (cG#lxcA) variables:

sB
          !force !force set-variable #l1 @ml04 "Write-region file"
          !if &not $status
              !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
              !abort
          !endif
          write-buffer #l1

sA
    cDTIP:cA
 
       Avoid using the global variables (cG#g1cA etc.) as these could be altered
       by other macros. Sub-macros (i.e. macros called by other macros) can
       pass values back to their calling macro via the parent's register
       variables (cG#p1cA etc.). When using parent register variables then ensure
       that the sub-macro does not destroy some context of the parent macro
       through altering a register variable that has been used for another
       purpose.

    At the start of this section we said that there were two techniques by
    which we could get user input, we selected the first (which was less
    desirable than the second). The approach that we have taken of passing the
    filename to cDwrite-buffercA appears to be correct, however the cDwrite-buffercA
    command probably expects a reasonable filename -- what happens if the user
    enters a directory name ? There are other potential esoteric problems with
    our current approach, all of which may be overcome, but not here.

    The second technique, which is by far the best solution, is to simply get
    the command lswrite-buffer(2)lmwrite-buffer(2)le to get its input directly from the user. The
    command does this by default when bound to a key and run from the command
    line however when run from a macro the behavior is different as there is
    no command line. We can force this behavior by asking the command to be
    executed as if it were run from the command line:-

sB
          write-buffer @mn

sA
    When cDwrite-buffercA asks the MicroEmacs macro processor for a file name the
    lsMessageLineVariables(4)lm@mnle argument tells it to go directly to the user even though ME is
    currently running a macro. This will only get a single argument from the
    user, if the file already exits cDwrite-buffercA asks for confirmation that
    over-writing the existing file is okay, but this argument has not been
    given so the command fails. To fix this we could do:

sB
          write-buffer @mn "y"

sA
    However this has now created even more issues, what happens if this file
    is already loaded into MicroEmacs, should we allow the user to decide ? We
    could allow the command line to handle all of the cases:

sB
          write-buffer @mn @mn @mn @mn ....

sA
    Which is rapidly becoming very messy for each individual argument, instead
    we use lsMessageLineVariables(4)lm@mnale to ask the command to handle all input associated with the
    command:

sB
          write-buffer @mna

sA
    Note that we should have used this for the first method to protect
    cDwrite-buffercA:

sB
          write-buffer #l1 @mna

sA
    In this case the file name is provided by the argument cG#l1cA but the
    remaining arguments are handled internally by the command itself as if
    invoked from the command line.

    Moreover, there is one subtle problem here that can cause a lot of
    problems especially for other macros trying to use this macro (uses tend
    to spot the problem themselves and correct it causing only minor
    frustration). The macro creates a new temporary buffer which has no file
    name, this means that saving to cGcG./filecAcA will write the region to cGcGfilecAcA
    in the startup directory rather than in the current buffer's file path.
    For example, if you start MicroEmacs from cGcG/bincAcA, load file cGcG/tmp/foo.txtcAcA
    and cGwrite-regioncA cGcG./bar.txtcAcA you will create the file cGcG/bin/bar.txtcAcA not
    cGcG/tmp/bar.txtcAcA.

    To solve this directory issue the file name of the temporary buffer has to
    be set to the same filename as the current buffer we are copying from.
    This is safe as this is a temporary buffer (starts with a cCcG*cAcA) so
    MicroEmacs will not attempt to auto save or allow the buffer to be saved
    using lswrite-buffer(2)lmwrite-bufferle and is performed as follows:

sB
          define-macro write-region
              copy-region
              set-variable #l0 $buffer-fname       ; ADDED to fix directory location
              !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              yank
              set-variable $buffer-fname #l0       ; ADDED to fix directory location
              write-buffer @mna
              delete-buffer $buffer-bname
          !emacro

sA
    After all of that, the solution is in fact very simple, however the
    underlying complexity of the user expectations as to the behavior of the
    command are complicated.


cE5. What happens if the user aborts during the macro ?  cA


    This issue has already been touched on in the previous sections, by using
    the cD@mnacA only the cDwrite-buffercA is likely to be aborted while the user is
    prompted for a file name etc. and if the user manages to abort elsewhere
    there really is not much that can be done about it without severely
    impacting the complexity of the macro. Practically it is only necessary to
    catch the exception when the user is being prompted on the command line
    with cDwrite-buffercA, as with our existing user input a double cD!forcecA is
    required to catch an abort at a prompt.

sB
          define-macro write-region
              copy-region
              set-variable #l0 $buffer-fname
              !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              yank
              set-variable $buffer-fname #l0
              !force !force write-buffer @mna
              !if &not $status
                  !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
                  !abort
              !endif
              delete-buffer $buffer-bname
          !emacro

sA    The ls$status(5)lm$status(5)le variable allows us to catch the exit state of the forced
    command and test for an abort condition following the forced statement.
    Note that the cD$statuscA value is only valid immediately after the last
    executed command, executing another command changes the value of cD$statuscA.
    If the status is required after execution of another command then it may
    be saved in a variable and used later.


cE6. what happens if the write fails (disk full or file exists etc) ?  cA


    As the cDwrite-buffercA command should handle write file failures sensibly,
    and we have enabled it to get input from the user, then the command will
    automatically handle the failure conditions. Within our macro then it is
    simply a case of detecting and handling the failure condition -- we have
    already done this by handling the user input so no additions are required
    to the macro.


cE7. What happens if the current buffer displayed in more than one window ?  cA


    If the user has the current buffer displayed only once then the action of
    deleting the temporary buffer returns the current window to the previous
    buffer, as required. If however the buffer is displayed more than once
    then when the temporary buffer is deleted MicroEmacs will select a
    different non-displayed buffer to become the current window (unless this
    is the only buffer) and so the user will not be returned back to their
    original buffer.

    This may be fixed by storing the initial buffer name and explicitly
    returning to it after the cDdelete-buffercA:

sB
          define-macro write-region
              copy-region
              set-variable #l0 $buffer-fname
              set-variable #l1 $buffer-bname
              !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              yank
              set-variable $buffer-fname #l0
              !force !force write-buffer @mna
              !if &not $status
                  !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
                  find-buffer #l1
                  !abort
              !endif
              delete-buffer $buffer-bname
              find-buffer #l1
          !emacro

sA
    However, when there are two windows into the same buffer the command may
    inherit the other window's buffer location, i.e. if the current window is
    on line 100 and the other window display this buffer is at line 200 the
    above version will leave the user at line 200 and a different region. The
    commands lsset-position(2)lmset-position(2)le and lsgoto-position(2)lmgoto-position(2)le allow the current position
    to be saved and later restored, the commands both take a single character
    which identifies the saved position, this allows multiple positions to be
    saved. Re-writing our macro to save and restore the buffer position we
    get:

sB
          define-macro write-region
              copy-region
              set-variable #l0 $buffer-fname
              set-position "P"
              !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              yank
              set-variable $buffer-fname #l0
              !force !force write-buffer @mna
              !if &not $status
                  !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
                  goto-position "P"
                  !abort
              !endif
              delete-buffer $buffer-bname
              goto-position "P"
          !emacro

sA
cE8. Does this fit in with other MicroEmacs commands and macros ?  cA


    Finally we should consider how to make the macro more like a built in
    command so that other users and macros can take advantage of this new
    feature. Firstly let us consider supporting the numerical argument which
    is passed to all commands and macros. Considering cDwrite-buffercA the command
    permits an invocation from the command line of:

        esc 0 C-x C-w


    or from a macro:

        0 write-buffer


    The cG0cA argument disables validity checks and therefore forces the write. It
    would be reasonable to expect that a new command that writes a region to a
    file behaves in exactly the same way, where the commands have consistent
    behavior it makes it far easier for the user to guess how like commands
    operate. Unfortunately this behavior is absent from our current macro
    command. To support the numerical argument then the lsMacroArguments(4)lm@?le and lsMacroArguments(4)lm@#le variables
    are used to test for and retrieve the numerical argument.

sB
          define-macro write-region
              copy-region
              set-variable #l0 $buffer-fname
              set-position "P"
              !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              yank
              set-variable $buffer-fname #l0
              !if @?
                  !force !force @# write-buffer @mna
              !else
                  !force !force write-buffer @mna
              !endif
              !if &not $status
                  !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
                  goto-position "P"
                  !abort
              !endif
              delete-buffer $buffer-bname
              goto-position "P"
          !emacro

sA
    cDNote:cA
 
 >   that the cD!elsecA and cD!endifcA directive lines do not effect the setting of
       cD$statuscA so this is safe, only the execution of commands effect this
       variable.

    We can optimize the macro a little by noting that the default behavior of
    "cDwrite-buffercA" is the same as "cD1 write-buffercA" (this is not always the
    case), re-writing:

sB
          define-macro write-region
              copy-region
              set-variable #l0 $buffer-fname
              set-position "P"
              !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              yank
              set-variable $buffer-fname #l0
              !force !force @# write-buffer @mna
              !if &not $status
                  !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
                  goto-position "P"
                  !abort
              !endif
              delete-buffer $buffer-bname
              goto-position "P"
          !emacro

sA
    After all of this work there are still some compatibility problems to be
    resolved for our macro to be a true command replacement. Considering our
    use of cDwrite-buffercA, we have effectively have:

sB
          write-buffer "myfile"

sA
    The command gets the filename from the macro line and allow us to invoke
    the command in our own macros. So what about our new cDwrite-regioncA macro ?
    It is not unreasonable to expect that some macro developer in the future
    will want to write the current region out to a file and if we write this
    one correctly they will be able to use this command directly. At the
    moment a command invocation of

sB
          write-region "myfile"

sA
    in another macro will not have the desired effect. The cGcGmyfilecAcA argument
    is ignored and the user is always prompted for the file name. This can be
    solved by providing an optional parameter to be passed to the command
    using the /Hl @1 @1 4 variable as follows:

sB
          define-macro write-region
              copy-region
              set-variable #l0 $buffer-fname
              set-position "P"
              !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              yank
              set-variable $buffer-fname #l0
              !force set-variable #l1 @1
              !if $status
                  !force !force @# write-buffer #l1 @mna
              !else
                  !force !force @# write-buffer @mna
              !endif
              !if &not $status
                  !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
                  goto-position "P"
                  !abort
              !endif
              delete-buffer $buffer-bname
              goto-position "P"
          !emacro

sA
    Setting the register variable cG#l1cA to the first argument passed to the
    command will fail if no argument was given, so we use a cD!forcecA to stop the
    macro from quitting and change the cD$statuscA of the cDset-variablecA command. If
    the assignment fails then we get the filename from the user as before, if
    it succeeds then the calling macro has provided the file name.

    The cDwrite-regioncA macro is now complete and provides both a command line
    and macro interface. It is important to note that there is a subtle
    difference between macros and built in commands even though their
    capabilities are the same. To execute cDwrite-buffercA in a macro and get the
    user to supply a file name you must do:

sB
          write-buffer @mna

sA
    However for a macro, it is not itself a command and you cannot ask a macro
    to behave like a command. For a macro you must call it as:

sB
          write-region

sA
    The use of cCcG@mnacAcA is only valid for commands, this perhaps is a quirk of
    the language which should really be fixed in the future.


cEConcluding  cA


    We started this tutorial with a unusable 5 line macro and now have a 20
    line version which should be indistinguishable from a built in MicroEmacs
    command. The same command is available as part of the macro release and
    this document was written as part of the process of writing that macro.
    The only change to be made in making it part of the macro release is to
    change the cDset-positioncA label from cGcGPcAcA, which a user could use, to
    something like cGcG\x88cAcA which is much safer to use.

    The final macro release version becomes:

sB
          define-macro write-region
              copy-region
              set-variable #l0 $buffer-fname
              set-position "\x88"
              !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              yank
              set-variable $buffer-fname #l0
              !force set-variable #l1 @1
              !if $status
                  !force !force @# write-buffer #l1 @mna
              !else
                  !force !force @# write-buffer @mna
              !endif
              !if &not $status

              delete-buffer $buffer-bname
              goto-position "\x88"

sA
    It is perhaps surprising the number of steps it has taken to write
    something that appears to be simple, however in writing macros there are
    many re-occurring themes and once familiar with the concepts then then you
    will typically get them right first time. Creating a macro like this takes
    approximately half an hour.

    We have to question whether it is worth writing these extensions. If you
    find yourself doing the same thing all the time then definitely yes, it
    will save time and you will have less aches and pains in your hand.
    Spending the extra time to write a good macro saves time in the long run,
    it also provides a better base on which more sophisticated macros may be
    based. MicroEmacs has actually evolved like this. Hopefully this tutorial
    will encourage rather than frighten off budding macro writers.

cEcEMACRO DEBUGGING cEcA


    In writing new macros then you need to debug them, there are various
    strategies as follows:-


cETracing  cA


    The simplest method is to add debugging information that is printed on the
    message line that traces the execution sequence as it progresses through
    the macro.

    Use lsml-write(2)lmml-write(2)le to print out values as you go, use

sB
          1000 ml-write &spr "Got here, value [%s]" #l1

sA
    to see the values. The integer argument is a delay in milliseconds, the
    command above will print the message and then wait 1 second before
    continuing with execution. The wait allows you to see the message.

    Once the macro is debugged then delete or comment out the trace messages.


cEDebugger  cA


    The macro debugger is a built in debugger that allows the macro execution
    sequence to be traced and debugged. The debugger is operation is
    controlled by the variable ls$debug(5)lm$debug(5)le by default the value is cG0cA which
    disables the debugger. The debugger displays the next command to execute
    in the message line and the user may single step through the macro and
    interrogate the variables.

    Use the cD$debugcA variable for interactive debugging. The best way is to
    insert the following line somewhere BEFORE the problem occurs where the
    macro needs to be debugged:

sB
          set-variable $debug 1

sA
    As soon as this variable is set then it drops the user into debug mode. If
    we applied this to our tutorial example then we would define it as:

sB
          define-macro write-region
              set-variable $debug 1       ; Enable debugger
              copy-region
              set-variable #l0 $buffer-fname
              set-position "\x88"
              !force delete-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              find-buffer "*write-region-tmp*"
              yank
              set-variable $buffer-fname #l0
              !force set-variable #l1 @1
              !if $status
                  !force !force @# write-buffer #l1 @mna
              !else
                  !force !force @# write-buffer @mna
              !endif
              !if &not $status
                  !force delete-buffer $buffer-bname
                  goto-position "\x88"
                  !abort
              !endif
              delete-buffer $buffer-bname
              goto-position "\x88"
          !emacro

sA
    so as soon as we execute cDwrite-regioncA then we drop into debug mode. The
    mode line appears as follows:-

        macro-name:position:number [line] ?


    where cDmacro-namecA is the name of the macro that is executing, cDpositioncA is
    the line from the start of the macro definition. cDlinecA is the macro line
    that is being executed. i.e.

        display-matching-fenc:22:0 [4 show region] ?


    At the prompt the commands that are available are:-

    cG?cA
    
       Help, display the debugger commands.

    cG^GcA
    
       Abort the macro. Immediately terminates the macro sequence, the state
       of the buffers is undefined and leaves the windows in the state when
       the macro was aborted.

    cG^LcA
    
       Redraws the current screen.

    cGccA
    
       Continues macro execution the value of $debug is set to 0. Execution
       continues without user interaction up until the next cD$debugcA change.

    cGscA
    
       Single steps through the macro, if another macro is invoked then
       debugging with continue in the new sub-macro.

    cGvcA
    
       Display the value of a variable. The user is prompted for a variable
       value to show, once entered, the value of the variable is displayed.

    cC<any>cA
 
       Any other key will step onto the next instruction, unlike cCstepcA then
       any macros that are invoked are not debugged.

    See the ls$debug(5)lm$debug(5)le help page for more information.

    It is important that you SAVE ALL YOUR WORK before starting to debug
    macros. It is possible to sometimes crash the editor up while developing
    macros, prior to the January 2005 build then the following example of
    infinite recursion would destroy the editor:

sB
          define-macro Test
              Test
          !emacro

sA
    This macro nesting is now caught the nesting is limited to 20 calling
    macros.

    For everyday macros that the typical user will write MicroEmacs will be
    robust and is not likely to result in any damage. If you start writing
    macros with for deeply nested macro hooks from the core of MicroEmacs
    (i.e. ipipe callbacks) then deleting buffers under the editor will cause
    stability problems when mistakes are made. For performance reasons it is
    not possible to check for all permutations of every command that could be
    issued that may possibly change the state of the editor and then recover.
    Provided that the calls are used within their calling remit then no ill
    effects will be observed.

! 4 macroOverview
cEcEMACRO LANGUAGE OVERVIEW cEcA


    MicroEmacs macro language is a run-time interpreted language and uses a
    prefix notation form, that is operators appear before their arguments,
    sometimes known as Polish notation, i.e. cC`+ 3 4`cA rather than the more
    conventional infix notation cC`3 + 4`cA).

    Every line is self contained, you cannot make a single command span
    multiple line (by using something like a '\' character as in C or tcl).

    Comments start with semi-colon cCcG;cAcA, anything to the right of an unquoted
    semi-colon is ignored.

sB
          ; I'm a comment and exist to the end of line.
          set-variable #l1 1     ; I am a comment to the end of line.

sA
    There are three types of line

    - Blank or comment line
    - Process flow control lines using directives (i.e. cC`!if #l1`cA)
    - Executable command lines (i.e. cGforward-linecA)

    The first letter of any word or token on a line is very important and
    informs MicroEmacs and the user what type of token it is. The basic token
    start characters are:

       `;` Comment
       `$` System or environment variable
       `%` User variable
       `:` Buffer variable
       `.` Command variable
       `#` Register variable
       `@` Macro variable
       `!` Directive
       `&` Function
       `"` A string, which finishes at the next unquoted `"`.
       `0-9` A number, which is read as a string
       `*` A goto label

    If its not one of the above then it must be the first letter of a
    command name.


cEEscape Character  cA


    cDBackslashcA cCcG\cAcA cDis escape character in macro scripts, so every normalcA
    cDoccurrence needs to be doubled.cA

    The MicroEmacs macro language uses a backslash cCcG\cAcA character as an escape
    character. In order to use a backslash character in macro arguments then
    all backslash characters should be themselves escaped with another
    backslash i.e. cCcG\cAcA becomes cCcG\\cAcA or cCcG\\cAcA becomes cCcG\\\\cAcA. If the escaping is
    omitted then it is likely that the command will receive an incorrect
    character sequence that will be misinterpreted and cause the command to
    fail or perform an incorrect action.


cEComments  cA


    Comments may appear anywhere on a line and everything to the right of the
    semi-colon to the end of the line is ignored:

sB
          ; this is a comment
          set-variable #l0 1    ; this part of the line is a comment.

sA
cESystem or environment variables  cA


    MicroEmacs system variables start with cCcG$cAcA and are used to configure most
    aspects of the editor (such as tab widths, window drawing characters
    etc.). There are a fixed list of system variables, see lsMacro GlossarylmMicroEmacs - Macro Language Glossaryle.

    If a given variable name is not a recognized system variable (e.g. cG$PATHcA)
    then MicroEmacs treats it as an environment variable, using
    lsset-variable(2)lmset-variable(2)le to change an environment variable. This is useful when
    used in conjunction with one of MicroEmacs's shell commands. If the
    environment variable does not exist its value is returned as the string
    cGcGERRORcAcA.


cEUser variables  cA


    User variables commence with a percentage character cCcG%cAcA and have a global
    context within the editor, but unlike the cCsystemcA cCvariablescA they do not
    span into the environment space (i.e. private to MicroEmacs).

    The use of cDUser VariablescA is discouraged because of their scope,
    historically MicroEmacs only supported system and user variables. If two
    different macros use the same variable then things go wrong which is
    principally why they are no longer used. Macros have become a very large
    part of JASSPA's MicroEmacs and therefore they must be reliable by the
    nature of their global scope they are considered unreliable.

    A few commands still use them but this is more for historical reasons, for
    example xgrep's ls%xgrep-com(5)lm%xgrep-com(5)le variable to set the default grep command
    would be better implemented as the command variable cG.xgrep.comcA, see below.


cEBuffer Variables  cA


    Buffer variables are set in the context of a buffer, each buffer has its
    own independent list of buffer variables so this type of variable is used
    by macros which need to store buffer context information. As an example, a
    file hook may allow each buffer to have its own private ls$fill-ignore(5)lm$fill-ignore(5)le
    value (the variable is global). It may stores each buffer's own fill
    ignore in the variable cG:fill-ignorecA. This is private to the buffer.
    Referencing the variable cG:fill-ignorecA retrieves the current buffer's
    cG:fill-ignorecA variable, if it not set its value is returned as cGcGERRORcAcA.
    Referencing cG:*scratch*:fill-ignorecA retrieves the cGcG*scratch*cAcA buffer's
    cG:fill-ignorecA value.

    The operator ls&exist(4)lm&exist(4)le may be used to determine if the buffer variable has
    been created and set.


cECommand Variables  cA


    Command variables are set in the context of a command or macro and are
    similar to buffer variables. cG.varcA retrieves the the current macros command
    variable whereas cG.hilight.varcA will get command cDhilightcA command variable.

    It is important to understand that these variables are stored with the
    command and the command must exist before the variable is used. As an
    example of the command variable scope, consider the following macro
    definitions.

sB
          define-macro Test1
              ml-write &spr "Test1 .foo is [%s]" .foo
          !emacro
          set-variable .Test1.foo "hello world"
          define-macro Test2
              ml-write &spr "Test1 .foo is [%s]" .Test1.foo
          !emacro

sA
    On running cDTest1cA and cDTest2cA both will print "cGTest1cA cG.foocA cGiscA cG[hellocA cGworld]cA".
    The initialisation of cG.Test1.foocA is performed outside of the macro and is
    done only once, once the variable has been initialized the line is
    discarded. This discard reduces the run-time memory overhead.


cERegister Variables  cA


    Most variables are used to store temporary information, once a macro
    completes the variable is no longer required. lsMicroEmacs - Macro Language GlossarylmRegister variablesle are used
    for this purpose, their scope is only the current macro's execution as
    such they are the most efficient variables to use.

    A new set of registers is created every time that a macro is executed,
    called cG#l0cA through to cG#l9cA. Where macros are nested then the parent
    registers are effectively stacked and may be access through cG#p0cA through to
    cG#p9cA, this is especially useful when writing recursive macros or macros
    which must return values as they may return a processed result in the
    parents register. A single set of registers always exists which is the
    global registers cG#g0cA through to cG#g9cA, for a first level macro then this
    forms its parent register variable.


cEMacro variables  cA


    lsMicroEmacs - Macro Language GlossarylmMacro variablesle commence with a at-sign @ and are only available in the
    context of a macro and are used to retrieve the numeric argument,
    parameters etc. The variables include:-

       cD@?cA - Boolean determines if a numeric argument was supplied  
       cD@#cA - The value of the numeric argument  
 
       cD@0cA - The name of the macro  
       cD@1cA - The first argument of macro  
       cD@2cA - The second argument of macro  
       cD@3cA ... cD@cAcCncA  

       cD@pcA - The name of the calling (or parent) macro.


cEDirectives  cA


    The lsMicroEmacs - Macro Language GlossarylmMacro Directivesle are denoted by a cD!cA prefix and provide control over
    the command sequence. Directives are used to define macros and affect the
    macro execution sequence. i.e.

sB
          define-macro if-test
              set-variable #l0 1
              !if #l0
                  ml-write "you will see this"
                  !return
              !elif &not #l0
                  ml-write "you will not see this"
                  !abort
              !else
                  ml-write "you will not see this"
                  !abort
              !endif
          !emacro

sA 
    The common directives are:-

    cD!abortcA
 
      ls!return(4)lm!abortle terminates a macro and exits with a false status.

    cD!returncA

      ls!return(4)lm!returnle terminates a macro and exits with a true status.

    cD!whilecA/cD!continuecA/cD!donecA
 
      ls!while(4)lm!whilele defines a conditional loop that is tested before entry to the
       loop, the ls!while(4)lm!continuele statement within the loop allows the loop to be
       broken. cD!whilecA loops may not be nested, but may be contained within a
      ls!repeat(4)lm!repeat/!untille construct.

    cD!repeat/!untilcA

      ls!repeat(4)lm!repeatle defines a conditional loop that is tested on exit from the
       loop. cD!repeatcA loops may not be nested, but may be contained within a
      ls!while(4)lm!while/!donele construct.

    cDdefine-macro/!emacrocA
 
      lsdefine-macro(2)lmdefine-macrole defines a new macro which is terminated with a ls!emacro(4)lm!emacrole.

    cD!if/!elif/!else/!endifcA

      ls!if(4)lm!ifle defines a conditional statement, where there is more than one
      condition then the ls!if(4)lm!elifle directive may continue the conditional test.

    cD!goto/!tgotocA
 
      ls!goto(4)lm!gotole and ls!goto(4)lm!tgotole provide an absolute unconditional and conditional
      jump to a cD*labelcA in a file, respectively. A cD!gotocA label is defined as
      line commencing with a cG*cA followed by a name i.e. cD*labelcA.

    cD!forcecA cCcommandcA
 
      ls!force(4)lm!forcele ignores the return status of a command while executing a macro,
       thereby ignoring any exceptions which would otherwise halt macro
       execution.


cEFunctions  cA


    All lsIntroduction to Variable Functionslmfunctionsle are denoted by a cD&cA prefix, they are perhaps miss named and
    should be called operators as they operate on variables and literal
    strings to produce a new result.

    There are different type of functions:

    - Numeric - interprets arguments as numbers i.e. add two numbers
      ls&add(4)lm&add(4)le.
    - String - interprets arguments as strings i.e. to concatenate two
          strings together ls&cat(4)lm&cat(4)le.
    - Logical - boolean operators i.e. greater than ls&great(4)lm&great(4)le.
    - Key - key bindings i.e. key binding of command ls&cbind(4)lm&kbind(4)le.
    - Bitwise - bit-wise numerical operators i.e. bitwise AND ls&band(4)lm&band(4)le.
    - File - file interaction i.e. find a file ls&find(4)lm&find(4)le.
    - Lists - string item lists i.e. find item in list ls&lfind(4)lm&lfind(4)le.
    - Miscellaneous - miscellaneous functions to which query and return
          information to the caller i.e. registry query ls&reg(4)lm&reg(4)le.

    The functions use a postfix notation as the cCfunctioncA appears before the
    arguments.

sB
          set-variable #l0 2
          set-variable #l1 1
          !if &gre #l0 #l1
              ml-write "#l0 is greater than #l1"
          !endif

          ml-write &cat "#l0 + #l1 = " &add #l0 #l1

sA
    The interpretation of strings and numbers is discussed in the next
    section.


cEStrings and Numbers  cA


    All variables are treated as strings within MicroEmacs so the integer
    value of 102 is the string cG"102"cA. Where functions require an integer
    argument (i.e. ls&abs(4)lm&addle) the strings are converted to integers, operated on
    and converted back to a string result. Floating point notation is not
    understood.

    Integers may be expressed in different bases:

       `0xXXX` - Hexadecimal notation i.e. _0x12af_.
       `0oooo` - Octal notation requires a leading _012673_.
       `ddddd` - Decimal notation _12345_.

    Strings do not necessarily need to be quoted, provided that the string is
    unambiguous and does not include any special characters then all input
    between white spaces is considered to be a string. Strings may be quoted
    cCcG"string"cAcA, within a quoted string then a backslash cCcG\cAcAis used as an
    escape character. the escape sequences that are interpreted include:

       `\\` - A backslash character.
       `\t` - A literal TAB character.
       `\n` - A literal NEWLINE character.
       `\xx` - A hexadecimal character.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDmecA "@gdiff" "cCversion1cA" "cCversion2cA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    MicroEmacs may be executed from the command line to invoke the Graphical
    Difference lsgdiff(3)lmgdiff(3)le macro, showing the difference(s) between two files.

    The editor is invoked in cDgdiffcA mode and shows the difference between the
    two files on the command line. The two files are presented side by side
    and the lines are matched together, the windows are effectively locked
    together, scrolling one window causes the other window to scroll.

    The changes are shown as color coded regions of highlighted text. Each
    block (or line) has to be accepted or rejected by the user, when all
    blocks have been accepted then the buffer may be written out merging the
    changes from both files depending on the accept/reject status. Blocks
    which have been accepted are typically shown in green, the rejected lines
    are shown in red.


cEKey Mapping  cA


    The keyboard mapping in cDgdiffcA mode is defined as follows:

    cDesc-hcA
 
       Help information.

    cDC-upcA/cDpcA
 
       Advance to the previous difference.

    cDC-downcA/cDncA
 
       Advance to the next difference.

    cDesc-upcA/P
 
       Advance to the previous unassigned difference.

    cDesc-downcA/N

    2unix - Convert text files to UNIX format files
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDmecA "@2dos" cC<files>cA  
    cDmecA "@2mac" cC<files>cA  
    cDmecA "@2unix" cC<files>cA  
    cDmecA "@2win" cC<files>cA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The start-up file cG2unix.emfcA may be invoked from the command line as a
    filter to convert all text files, which may be in MS-DOS, Windows,
    Macintosh format into UNIX text format.

    Each file specified on the command line is interrogated and the line
    ending modified to UNIX.

    cG2doscA, cG2wincA and cG2maccA similarly operate to provide conversion from any of
    these formats to MS-DOS, Macintosh or Windows file formats.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    When using ME as a command line filter it is advisable to control the
    backup command line options. Typically the backups and auto-save are
    disabled so that no backup files are generated i.e.

        me -a -B "@2dos" files...


    Performs a conversion from UNIX to MS-DOS and disables the generation of
    auto-save files and backups.

    NE may be used to run the filters, by default NE runs without backup and
    auto-save mode enabled and the flags should NOT be used.

        ne "@2dos" files...


cENOTES cA


    cGMS-DOScA files are defined to use a line ending of cG\r\ncA, the file is
    terminated with cGctrl-zcA.

    Macintosh files are defined to use a line ending of cG\rcA, there is no
    special end of file character.

    Microsoft Windows files are defined to use a line ending of cG\r\ncA, there is
    no special end of file character.

    UNIX files are defined to use a line ending of cG\ncA, there is no special end
    of file character.

    The unix2dos.emf, dos2unix.emf and unix2win.emf were renamed to 2dos.emf,
    2unix.emf and 2win.emf when 2mac.emf was added in October 2006 as the
    'from' format is not important and number of combinations became
    unmanageable.

    benchmrk - Benchmark MicroEmacs macro processor speed
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDmecA "@benchmrk"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The start-up file cGbenchmrk.emfcA may be invoked from the command line to
    time the macro processor variable manipulation times.

    This macro suite was developed to optimize the macro processor
    performance, and allows comparable analysis of various macro variable
    manipulations. The macro is not important in it's own right and is not
    likely to be useful. Running it will provide an in-site into the speed of
    the macro language and should indicate to the user what are good and bad
    things to be doing.

    As an aside, as MicroEmacs interprets the macro code the it is important
    that the processing operates at a reasonable speed. Most extensions
    offering additional functionality are likely to be added to MicroEmacs by
    way of a macro implementation - this allows speedy development of new
    features. Obviously core changes do occur when we find that we cannot
    support certain new requirements, or when the macro code becomes too
    convoluted. In these cases, new commands are added to help us solve the
    problem. However, recent evolution of the code has indicated that the core
    set is now reasonably complete.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The start-up file cGctags.emfcA may be invoked from the command line to
    generate a cDtagscA file for C and C++ source and header files.

    Given a list of cCfilescA a tags file cGtagscA is generated in the current
    directory, which may be used by the lsfind-tag(2)lmfind-tag(2)le command. This is a good
    alternative on Microsoft platforms where a utility such as cDctags(1)cA is not
    typically available. If no cCfilescA are specified the default file list is
    cGcG./cAcA, i.e. process the current directory. If a directory name is given
    (such as the default cGcG./cAcA) all C and C++ source and header files within
    the directory will be processed.

    The value of variable cD%tag-optioncA is used to control the tag generation
    process, its value cC<flags>cA can contain any number of the following flags:

    cGacA
 
       Append new tags to the existing tag file, note that if also using flag
       cCcGmcAcA multiple 'tags' to the same item may be created.

    cGmcA
 
       Enable multiple tags. This enables the existence of 2 tags with the
       same tag name, but typically with different locations. See help on
       lsfind-tag(2)lmfind-tag(2)le for more information on multiple tag support.

    cGrcA
 
       Enables recursive mode, any sub-directory found within any given
       directories will also be processed.

    cGvcA
 
       Add global variables to the tag file. (i.e. variables marked with
       cCexterncA).

    cGecA
 
       Add enumerated variables to the tag file (i.e. cCenumcA members).

    cGscA
 
       Add structure, type definitions and classes to the tag file (i.e.
       cCstuctcA, cCtypedefcA and cCclasscA).

    The generated tags file includes cG#definecA and C++ class names.

    Given a list of cCfilescA a tags file cGtagscA is generated in the current
    directory, which may be used by the lsfind-tag(2)lmfind-tag(2)le command. This is a good
    alternative on Microsoft platforms where a utility such as cDctags(1)cA is not
    typically available to process Java files. If no cCfilescA are specified the
    default file list is cGcG./cAcA, i.e. process the current directory. If a
    directory name is given (such as the default cGcG./cAcA) all Java source files
    within the directory will be processed.

    The value of variable cD%tag-optioncA is used to control the tag generation
    process, its value cC<flags>cA can contain any number of the following flags:

    cGacA
 
       Append new tags to the existing tag file, note that if also using flag
       cCcGmcAcA multiple 'tags' to the same item may be created.

    cGmcA
 
       Enable multiple tags. This enables the existence of 2 tags with the
       same tag name, but typically with different locations. See help on
      lsfind-tag(2)lmfind-tag(2)le for more information on multiple tag support.

    cGrcA
 
       Enables recursive mode, any sub-directory found within any given
       directories will also be processed.

    cGvcA
 
       Add global variables to the tag file. (i.e. variables marked with
       cCexterncA).

    cGscA
 
       Add classes definitions to the tag file (i.e. cCclasscA).

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDcompilecA gets and executes the compile command using a pipe execution
    (incremental pipe on UNIX platforms), loading the output into a buffer
    called "cD*compile*cA", with go to error parsing using the command
    lsget-next-line(2)lmget-next-line(2)le. The default compile execution is set by variable
    ls%compile-com(5)lm%compile-com(5)le, the error parsing is setup using the command
    lsadd-next-line(2)lmadd-next-line(2)le.

    Before the compile command is executed lssave-some-buffers(2)lmsave-some-buffers(2)le is executed to
    allow the user to ensure that all relevant buffers are saved. If an
    argument is given to compile then it is passed on to this command, so if
    an argument of 0 is given, all buffers are automatically saved.

    By default the output lines in the window wrap, wrapping may be disabled
    during compilations by redefining the wrap mode as follows. Create the
    file cGmyipipe.emfcA to redefine the behavior and add the following lines:-

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDxgrepcA executes the cDgrep(1)cA command with the command line set by the
    ls%xgrep-com(5)lm%xgrep-com(5)le variable and the user supplied expression and file list
    cCfiles...cA. The output of the command is piped into the cD*grep*cA buffer ready
    for the lsget-next-line(2)lmget-next-line(2)le command to step through all matched lines. The
    syntax from the grep output must be setup using lsadd-next-line(2)lmadd-next-line(2)le.

    If an argument is given then a lspipe-shell-command(2)lmpipe-shell-command(2)le is used instead of
    lsipipe-shell-command(2)lmipipe-shell-command(2)le, this is useful when used in macros as it ensures
    that cDgrepcA has finished before the command returns.

    cDrgrepcA is similar to cDgrepcA in that it uses cDgrep(1)cA to search for all
    occurrences of cCexpressioncA, but cDrgrepcA also uses cDfind(1)cA to search for
    cCexpressioncA in all files matching the cCfile-maskcA in all directories from
    cCbase-pathcA down.


cENOTES cA


    cDxgrepcA is a macro defined in cGxfind.emfcA.

    cDgrep(1)cA must be executable on the system before grep or rgrep can
    function, cDfind(1)cA must also be available for rgrep to work. The cDfind(1)cA
    command is defined by variable ls%xfind-com(5)lm%xfind-com(5)le, the default when not defined
    is cGfindcA.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDparagraph-to-linecA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDparagraph-to-linecA is a variation of lsfill-paragraph(2)lmfill-paragraph(2)le. cDparagraph-to-linecA
    reduces each of the next cCncA paragraphs of text to single lines. This
    command is typically used to prepare text for import into a word processor
    such as cDMicrosoft WordcA or cDWord PerfectcA. Reduction of text to a single line
    allows the word processor to import the raw text file and keep the text
    within paragraph blocks. If the text is not prepared then all of the
    line-feeds have to be manually deleted.

    cDparagraph-to-linecA allows text based documents to be prepared in MicroEmacs
    2009 and imported into the word processor at the final stage for
    formatting and layout.

cEcENAME cEcA


    clean - Remove redundant white spaces from the current buffer
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDcleancA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDcleancA removes redundant white spaces from the current buffer, there are
    three types this command remove:

    1)
       Any space or tab character at the end of the line. All are removed
       until the last character is not a space or a tab, or the line is
       empty. Note that an empty line is not removed unless at the end of the
       buffer.

    2)
       Space characters are removed when the next character is a tab, making
       the space redundant, e.g. the strings cG` Hello World`cA and " Hello
       World" will look identical because the tab character ('cC cA') indents the
       text to the 8th column with or without the space so the space can be
       removed.

    3)
       Superfluous empty lines at the end of the buffer are removed, leaving
       only one empty line.

    4)
       If argument cCncA is given (value is not used) multiple blank lines are
       reduced to a single blank line.


cEDIAGNOSTICS cA


    `[Command illegal in view mode]`
    
       Caused by a redundant white space being found and the buffer being in
       view mode. Note that if clean completes while the buffer is in view
       mode then no superfluous white spaces where found.


cENOTES cA


    cDcleancA is a macro defined in cGformat.emfcA.

    Most of this command's operation is performed by simple regex search and
    replace strings:

    a)
       Search for: "[\t ]+$" Replace with: "\\0"

    b)
       Search for: "[ ]+\t" Replace with: "\t"

    c)
       Search for: "\n\n\n" Replace with: "\n\n"

    It is useful to define a new command called cDspotlesscA in the user macro
    file which cleans the file and removes blank lines. The new command is
    defined as follows:-

sB

$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDreplace-all-stringcA "cCfromcA" "cCtocA" "cCfilescA" ["_grep-from_"]


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDreplace-all-stringcA, similar to lsreplace-string(2)lmreplace-string(2)le, replaces all occurrences
    of "cCfromcA" to "cCtocA" in the given list of files without prompting the user.

    The command finds all occurrences of "cCfromcA" by calling the command lsgrep(3)lmgrep(3)le
    to search for string "cCfromcA" in files "cCfilescA". Thus all relevant edited
    files must be saved or cDgrepcA may return the wrong line numbers. This is
    achieved by a call to lssave-some-buffers(2)lmsave-some-buffers(2)le which prompts the user to save
    any changed buffers one at a time.

    Each occurrence of "cCfromcA" is jumped to using lsget-next-line(2)lmget-next-line(2)le and the
    string is replaced by the call:

sB
          -1 replace-string "from" "to"

sA
    This replaces all occurrences of "cCfromcA" to "cCtocA" on the current line only,
    hence the line numbers must be correct. This also means that the "cCfromcA"
    search string must be correctly formatted for both grep and
    replace-string, unless bit 0x02 is set (see below).

    The given argument cCncA is a bit based flag which changes the default
    behavior described above. The bits have the following effect:-

    cD0x01cA
    
       Prompt before saving any changed buffer, enabled by default. If this
       bit is not set then any changed buffer is automatically saved before
       the cDgrepcA is performed.

    cD0x02cA
    
       If set then a fourth argument "cCgrep-fromcA" must also be given. This
       string is used in place of the "cCfromcA" string for the cDgrepcA only.


cENOTES cA

        "[b]<s>"


    Where 'cCbcA' is an optional letter setting the required output base which can
    be one of the following:

        `b   ` - Binary
        `o   ` - Octal
        `d   ` - Decimal
        `x   ` - Hexadecimal

    Default when omitted is 'cCdcA' (decimal). "cCscA" is the sum to be calculated,
    which should be bodmas in form. Following is a list of valid symbols.

        `(..)` - Parentheses (contents calculated first)
        `!   ` - Logical not
        `&&  ` - Logical and
        `||  ` - Logical or
        `==  ` - Logical equals
        `!=  ` - Logical not equals
        `~   ` - Bitwise not
        `&   ` - Bitwise and
        `|   ` - Bitwise or
        `^   ` - Bitwise xor
        `/   ` - Divide

    Mahjongg - MicroEmacs 2009 version of the solitaire Mah Jongg game
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDMahjonggcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    Mah Jongg is an ancient Chinese game usually played by four players with
    tiles similar to dominos. This is a MicroEmacs 2009 version which was
    inspired by the X-Windows version of the same game. The X-Windows version
    for the solitaire game originally seen on the PC and later ported to
    SunView.


cETheory Of Play  cA


    The object of the game is to remove all the tiles from the board. Tiles
    are removed by matching two identical tiles which have either an open left
    edge or open right edge. The only exception to this rule is that any open
    "cCflowercA" tile (bamboo cG[BAMB]cA, orchid cG[ORCH]cA, plum cG[PLUM]cA, or chrysanthemum
    cG[CHRY]cA) matches any other open "cCflowercA" tile and any open "cCseasoncA" tile
    (spring, summer, autumn, or winter) matches any other open "cCseasoncA" tile.

    Tiles are stacked on the board, the height of the tile is indicated by the
    color coding as follows:-

        `Level 5` - White
        `Level 4` - Red
        `Level 3` - Yellow
        `Level 2` - Green
        `Level 1` - Cyan

    To remove a pair of tiles, click the left mouse button on a tile (which
    will show in the selection color) and then click the left mouse button on
    the matching tile. At this point, both tiles will disappear from the
    board. If after selecting the first tile, you decide that you don't wish
    to play that tile, simply reclick the left button on the selected tile,
    alternatively click the right button to deselect any selected tile.

    To the right of the board are a number of control buttons. To select an
    option, click the left mouse button on it.

    cDNEWcA

    Match-It - MicroEmacs 2009 version of the Match-It game
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDMatch-ItcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The object of the game is to score the largest number of points, to do
    this the player must complete as many sheets as possible. A sheet is
    completed when all the tiles are removed from the board within the given
    time limit - ALL sheet are possible. If the player fails to remove all the
    tiles before the time runs out a life is lost, if all lives have been lost
    then the game is over.

    Tiles are removed from the board by matching two identical tiles which
    have an 'extraction' path between them. The only exception to this rule is
    that any open "cCflowercA" tile (bamboo cG[BAMB]cA, orchid cG[ORCH]cA, plum cG[PLUM]cA, or
    chrysanthemum cG[CHRY]cA) matches any other open "cCflowercA" tile and any open
    "cCseasoncA" tile (spring, summer, autumn, or winter) matches any other open
    "cCseasoncA" tile.

    An 'extraction' path is a straight line which uses 2 or less right angles,
    the following are legal extraction paths, cCcG*cAcAs denote the right angles:

                          A---*       *-----*     A----*
              A----A          A       AXXXXXA     XXXXX|
                                                  A----*


    The following are illegal paths:

              *----*          *---*
              AXXXX|          |XXXA
              XXXXA*      A---*XXXX


    2 points are added to the score whenever a pair is successfully removed, a
    point is deducted whenever a pair is selected which can not be removed
    because there is no valid extraction path. There are 2 aids, pressing the
    right button on a tile when no other tile is selected will hilight all
    tiles of matching type, this costs 4 points. The other help is activated
    by a button at the top right of the screen and it removes a random
    removable pair (or informs the user that there are no removable pairs),
    there are a limited number of these helps.

    At the end of a successful sheet the score is increased be the time left,
    the number of lives and helps remaining and by the Pedigree and Internal
    bonuses if they were achieved.

    The Pedigree bonus is obtained when only identical tiles are paired, i.e.
    no differing flowers or seasons were paired, 50 points are awarded when
    achieved. Its status is indicated by a 'P' to the left of the 'Help'
    button and the top of the window.

    The internal bonus is obtained when the outer 4 margins are not used. If
    the left or right margins are not used then 10 points are awarded for
    each, if the top or bottom are not used then 20 points are awarded for
    each and if none are used then 400 points are awarded! The status on the
    Internal bonus is indicated by an cCcGIcAcA surrounded by cCcG*cAcAs, one for each
    margin. This can be found next to the Pedigree bonus cCcGPcAcA.

    Traditional falling blocks game, make solid horizontal lines out of the
    falling blocks. The blocks can be rotated and moved left or right by the
    user as they fall. Once a horizontal line is completely solid it will
    disappear and everything above it will drop down. A bonus is given if 3
    solid rows are made at the same time, i.e. using one block.

    Every line you make the game speeds up until it gets too fast!! The game
    ends when there is no more room to put a block.

    The keys used to control Metris are:

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDPatiencecA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    Patience (or Solitaire) is a solitaire game using a standard set of
    playing cards. The object of the game is to use all of the cards in the
    deck to build up four suit stacks from Ace to King.

    The board is laid out with the dealer pile at the top right hand corner,
    to the left are four suit stacks onto which cards of the same suit are
    placed, in ascending order from the Ace. Below these two areas of the
    board are seven row stacks, organized in a triangular shape with zero to
    six downward facing cards.

    Cards may be moved around the playing area by stacking alternative red and
    black cards in descending order on the row stacks. When a row stack has no
    upturned cards on the stack then the top card may be turned over and may
    be played. If a stack becomes empty then only a King may be moved into the
    vacant position. Cards may be removed from the dealer, they are
    over-turned in sets of three cards, the underlying 2 cards are visible,
    but are not accessible, only the top card may be removed and played from
    the dealer.

    Cards are moved around the board using the mouse. Cards may be moved from
    the dealer or between the row stacks by placing the mouse over the card to
    be moved and pressing the left mouse button. Move the cursor to the new
    card position and release the left mouse button. If the move is legal then
    the card(s) are moved to the new stack. Multiple cards may be moved from
    the row stacks, the appropriate card(s) to be moved is automatically
    determined.

    Cards may be moved onto the suit stacks by a single left mouse press and
    release on the same card, the card is moved to the appropriate suit stack.
    The same technique is used to turn cards over in the suit stacks, and to
    deal the next set of cards by the dealer. To deal, then click on the
    down-turned card stack, if there are no further cards at the dealer then
    click on the empty position and the dealer will turn over the dealer stack
    and deal from the top again.

    Note that once a card is played onto the suit stacks then it cannot be
    removed.

    To the right of the board are a number of control buttons. To select an
    option, click the left mouse button on it, the buttons are labeled:

    cDDEALcA
 
       Start a new game by dealing new cards.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDTrianglecA is a solitaire game using a standard set of playing cards. The
    object of the game is to use all of the cards in the deck to build up four
    suit stacks from Ace to King.

    The board is laid out so that every card is used to create a triangle
    shape. In the first column there is one up-turned card, in the second
    column there is one down-turned card and 2 up-turned, third has 2 down 3
    up etc. The only break form this pattern is in the last 3 columns where
    there is an extra up-turned card so that all the deck is used.

    Cards may be moved around the playing area by stacking the same suit cards
    in descending order on the row stacks. When a row stack has no up-turned
    cards on the stack then the top card may be turned over and may be played.
    If a stack becomes empty then only a King may be moved into the vacant
    position.

    If the last card in a stack is an Ace then it can be moved to its suit
    stack, then the 2 of that suit etc. until finally the King is removed.

    Cards are moved around the board using the mouse. Cards may be moved from
    one row stack to another row stack by placing the mouse over the 'from'
    stack and pressing the left mouse button. Move the cursor to the 'to'
    stack and release the left mouse button. If the move is legal then the
    card(s) are moved to the new stack. Multiple cards may be moved from the
    row stacks, the appropriate card(s) to be moved is automatically

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDc-hash-evalcA evaluates C/C++ '#' lines, hiding sections of code which have
    been 'hashed' out. cDc-hash-evalcA evaluates the following '#' lines:-

        #define <variable> ....
        #ifdef <variable>
        #if ...
        #else
        #endif

    For cG#definecAs cDc-hash-evalcA creates a user variable cGcG%cd<variable>cAcA, setting
    it to the value found. For cG#ifdefcA a simple check for the existence of
    variable cGcG%cd<variable>cAcA is made. If defined then code between the cG#ifdefcA
    and either its matching cG#elsecA or cG#endifcA is displayed and code between the
    cG#elsecA and cG#endifcA is hidden. If it is not defined then the reverse happens.

    The state of cG#ifcA's are evaluated using lscalc(3)lmcalc(3)le, the following code is then
    displayed as for cG#ifdefcA.

    Code is hidden by setting the ls$line-scheme(5)lm$line-scheme(5)le to a color similar to the
    back-ground. If an argument is given to the command the code is also
    narrowed out using lsnarrow-buffer(2)lmnarrow-buffer(2)le.

    cDc-hash-delcA undoes the effect of cDc-hash-evalcA by restores hidden code.

    cDc-hash-set-definecA and cDc-hash-unset-definecA can be used to manually set and

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDetfinsrtcA "cCtemplatecA"  
    cCncA cDinsert-templatecA 


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDetfinsrtcA is generally called by file hooks when the new buffer has been
    created as opposed to loaded from a file (see ls$buffer-fhook(5)lm$buffer-fhook(5)le).

    cDetfinsrtcA uses ls&find(4)lm&find(4)le to locate and insert the required "cCtemplatecA.etf"
    file. If successful, cDetfinsrtcA then replaces the following strings in the
    template:

    cG$ASCII_TIME$cA
    
       To the current time. Inserts the output of lsascii-time(3)lmascii-time(3)le. The default
       format of the time string may be changed with ls.ascii-time.format(5)lm.ascii-time.format(5)le.

    cG$BUFFER_NAME$cA
    
       To the buffer name. The name is capitalized, '.'s are replaced with
       'cC' and any trailing "cA<##>_" digits (used to make the buffer name
       unique) are removed.

    cG$COMPANY_NAME$cA
    
       To the value of cD%company-namecA, or if not defined to the value used for
       cG$USER_NAME$cA. cD%company-namecA is usually set up in the company setup file
       defined in User setup.

    cG$USER_NAME$cA
    
       To the value of the registry entry cGcG/history/user-namecAcA, or if not
       defined to the value cGcG<unknown>cAcA. The user name is usually set up in
       the User setup dialog.

    cG$YEAR$cA
    
       To the current year (4 digit number).

    cG$CURSOR$cA
    
       To leave the cursor at this point, only one of these tokens should be
       used in the template and the token is removed.

     cDinsert-templatecA can be used to insert a different than the default language
     templates  by  adding  these   template  files with the etf  extension  to
     the users users-path folder. If not given a numeric argument it invokes 
     a menu for interactive template selection. Templates can be as well added
     to sub  folders in the  users-path  directory  where the folder name has to
     correspond  to the  file-hook  name, so emf templates  must be in a folder
     "emf", Markdown templates in a folder "md" etc.
      

cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following is taken from "cChkmake.emfcA" and inserts the "cCmakefile.etfcA"
    template if the buffer has been created.

sB
          define-macro fhook-make
              ; if arg is 0 this is a new file so add template
              !if &not @#
                  etfinsrt "makefile"
              !endif
              set-variable $buffer-hilight .hilight.make
              -1 buffer-mode "tab"  ; Normal tabs please !!!
              1 buffer-mode "indent"
              1 buffer-mode "time"
          !emacro
sA    
    For a set of Python  template  files  create a folder  "python" in your Jasspa
    users  folder, on Linux  usually  cC~/.jasspacA  in this folder place a set of
    etf-files like for instance  "class.etf",  "funcdoc.etf". If you now execute
    the command  cDinsert-templatecA  these two files will be  suggested  in the
    interactive menu at the command line if you press two times the TAB key.

       `%% ` - `%` char
       `%Y ` - 4 digit year
       `%y ` - 2 digit year
       `%B ` - Full month word

       `%#m` - 1 digit month
       `%d ` - 2 digit day
       `%#d` - 1 digit day
       `%A ` - Fill Week day word
       `%a ` - 3 letter week day
       `%H ` - 2 digit 24 hour
       `%M ` - 2 digit minute
       `%S ` - 2 digit second

    The default value of cD.ascii-time.formatcA when not defined is:

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDreplace-all-pairscA "cCfilescA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDreplace-all-pairscA uses the current buffer to extract "cCfromcA" and "cCtocA" pairs
    and then replaces all occurrences of "cCfromcA" to "cCtocA" in the given list of
    files without prompting the user. An optional third argument "cCgrepcA" can be
    given which will be used as the grep string, if not given the "cCfromcA"
    string is used. The format of the current buffer must be:

       /from1/to1/
       Xfrom2Xto2X
       ?from3?to3?
       /from4/to4/grep4/
            .
            .
       /fromN/toN/


    For each pair the command finds all occurrences of "cCfromcA" (or "cCgrepcA" if
    specified) by calling the command lsgrep(3)lmgrep(3)le to search for string "cCfromcA" in
    files "cCfilescA". Thus all relevant edited files must be saved or cDgrepcA may
    return the wrong line numbers. This is achieved by a call to
    lssave-some-buffers(2)lmsave-some-buffers(2)le between each replace pair, it is called with an
    argument of 0 to ensure that any changed buffers are automatically saved.

    Each occurrence of "cCfromcA" is jumped to using lsget-next-line(2)lmget-next-line(2)le and the
    string is replaced by the call:

sB
          -1 replace-string "from" "to"

sA
    This replaces all occurrences of "cCfromcA" to "cCtocA" on the current line only,
    hence the line numbers must be correct. This also means that the "cCfromcA"
    search string must be correctly formatted for both grep and
    replace-string.

    The given argument cCncA is a bit based flag which changes the default
    behavior described above. The bits have the following effect:-

    cD0x01cA
 
       Prompt before saving any changed buffers FIRST time ONLY, enabled by
       default. If set then the user is also prompted to continue before any
       changes are made. If this bit is not set then the command executes
       without any user input.


cENOTES cA


    cDreplace-all-pairscA is a macro defined in cGsearch.emfcA.

    The cDgrepcA command must be working before this command can function
    properly.

    It is not recommended to use a "from" or "to" string which uses more that
    one line as the results may be unpredictable.

    As the change is likely to be several pair strings with each changed
    buffer being saved between pairs lsundo(2)lmundo(2)le cannot be used to undo the

    more than once in this process, therefore it is strongly recommend that a
    backup of the files is made before commencing with this command.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDedit-dictionarycA "cCdictionarycA"  
    cDrestore-dictionarycA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDedit-dictionarycA dumps the contents of "cCdictionarycA" into the temporary
    buffer "*cCdictionarycA*", if this buffer already exists then cDedit-dictionarycA
    simply swaps to this buffer. This enables the user to correct and prune
    the words in any dictionary. The given dictionary must have already been
    added as a main dictionary using lsadd-dictionary(2)lmadd-dictionary(2)le.

    The format of the created buffer is one word on each line, each word takes
    one of the following 3 forms:

       `xxxx` - Good word `xxxx` with no spell rules allowed
       `xxxx/abc` - Good word `xxxx` with spell rules `abc` allowed
       `xxxx>yyyy` - Erroneous word with an auto-replace to `yyyy`

    Executing cDrestore-dictionarycA in a buffer created by cDedit-dictionarycA will
    first call lsdelete-dictionary(2)lmdelete-dictionary(2)le to remove the original dictionary from
    memory. It then uses lsadd-dictionary(2)lmadd-dictionary(2)le to create a new dictionary with the
    same name and then uses lsspell-add-word(3)lmspell-add-word(3)le to add all the words in the
    current buffer into the new dictionary.

    cDrestore-dictionarycA does not save the new dictionary.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDstart-upcA  
    cDshut-downcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    By default cDstart-upcA is not defined, if the command is defined (via a user
    macro) then it is executed immediately after MicroEmacs 2009 has completed
    its initialization.

    This command may initially seem redundant as the user may execute any
    command at start-up by editing the cGcGme.emfcAcA file or using the 'cCcC@cAcA'
    command-line argument. At the point of cGcGme.emfcAcA file execution none of the
    files specified on the command-line will be loaded, thus any actions
    required on the given command-line files will not work (the only buffer
    present will be the "cD*scratch*cA" buffer).

    The cDstart-upcA command is executed AFTER the execution of cGcGme.emfcAcA and
    initialization of buffers, but before MicroEmacs 2009 waits for user
    input.

    The cDshut-downcA command is also not defined by default, but if it is defined
    during the running of MicroEmacs the command will be called when
    MicroEmacs exits. The command is not called if MicroEmacs has to perform
    an emergency exit (due to the system being shut down or process being
    killed etc).

    cCncA cDfile-browsercA (cDf10cA)  
    cDfile-browser-closecA  
    cDfile-browser-swap-bufferscA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDfile-browsercA can be used to browse around the file system. When first
    executed cDfile-browsercA creates 2 buffers, cGcG*directory*cAcA displaying the
    directory structure and cGcG*files*cAcA listing the files in the current
    directory with information on each file. cDfile-browsercA displays these
    buffers side by side, splitting the current window horizontally if
    required. cDfile-browsercA uses a single window only when invoked with a
    numerical argument cCncA of zero (0).

    Once open the user can browse through the system using the following keys
    in the cG*directory*cA buffer, use cDesc-hcA for help within the buffer:

    cGspacecA
    
       Selects the directory on the current line and up-dates the cG*files*cA
       buffer with the information on this directory. This can also be done
       by clicking the left mouse button on the directory name.

    cGreturncA
    
       Selects the directory on the current line, if open (sub-directories
       displayed) then closes it or if closed it is opened. The cG*files*cA
       buffer is up-dated with the information on the directory. This can
       also be done by clicking the left mouse button on the cCcG+cAcA or cCcG-cAcA
       symbol just before the directory name.

    cGC-returncA
    
       As with cGreturncA expect sub-directories are recursively opened or
       closed, note that this could take some time on large file systems.
       This can also be done by clicking the right mouse button on the cCcG+cAcA or
       cCcG-cAcA symbol just before the directory name.

    cGtabcA
    
       Move to the cG*files*cA buffer.

    cGf10cA
    
       Closes file-browser.

    The following keys can be used in the cG*files*cA buffer:

    cGreturncA
    
       If the current line is a directory, this because the current
       directory, updating both the cG*directory*cA and cG*files*cA buffers. If the
       line is a file then it is opened using lsfind-file(2)lmfind-file(2)le. This can also be
       done by clicking the left mouse button on the file name.

       Where a cDfile-toolcA open action has been defined using
       lsfile-tool-setup(3)lmfile-tool-setup(3)le then the selected tool or utility is run to process
       the file. This may be used to launch viewers for PDF, image files etc.

    cGspacecA
    
       Toggles the tag state of the file on the current line, see cGxcA command.
       This can also be done by clicking the left mouse button anywhere
       before the file name, or for multiple files drag a region with the
       left mouse button.

    cGXcA or cGxcA
    
       Executes a lsshell-command(2)lmshell-command(2)le on all tagged files. The user is prompted
       for the command line which can contain the following special tokens:  

              %p  Full file name, including path.
              %f  The file name without the path.

       As the cDshell-commandcA is executed in the directory cG%fcA is safe to use in
       a command such as cG`del %f`cA.

    cGDcA or cGdcA or cGdeletecA
    
       Delete selected files or current file/directory.

    cGtabcA
    
       Move to the cG*directory*cA buffer.

    cGbackspacecA
    
       Move to the parent directory.

    cGlcA
    
       Refresh the listing from the file system.

    cGfcA
    
       Toggle the filter, enables/disables the display of back-up, object
       files etc.

    cGScA
    
       Initiates a search for files, at the command prompt then enter the
       leading characters to search for use cDC-scA and cDC-rcA to search forwards or
       backwards respectively. The cGscA version of this command is an
       incremental search and is easier to use.

    cGscA
    
       Launch an incremental search by name, at the prompt enter the search
       characters, use cDC-scA and cDC-rcA to search forwards or backwards

    cDmailcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDvmcA is a simple email manager, it is configured to send and receive emails
    using the lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le Mail dialog.

    cDmail-checkcA tests the size of this incoming mail box, a non-zero length
    indicates that new mail has arrived and cDmail-checkcA informs the user by
    inserting a cCcGMcAcA in the mode-line (2nd character for the left) and ringing
    the system bell. cDmail-checkcA uses lscreate-callback(2)lmcreate-callback(2)le to check for new mail
    every 10 minutes, this can be disabled by executing cDstop-mail-checkcA.

    When cDvmcA is executed it checks for new mail, if found it first copies the
    new mail to a file called cGcGnew_mailcAcA in the users mail directory. The
    incoming box is then emptied by truncating the file to zero length. The
    users main mail box is then loaded and the new mail (if any) is appended.
    The mail box is then processed after which 2 windows are created the
    bottom window listing all messages in the box and the top displaying the
    current message.

    cDvmcA is capable of:

    - Scrolling through the mail box displaying each message (cGupcA, cGpcA, cGdowncA,
          n, return, space).
    - Check and get new mail messages (cGgcA).
    - Extract and cut embedded data files (cGxcA, cGCcA, cGccA).
    - Reply to and forward mail messages (cGRcA, cGrcA, cGzcA).
    - Delete mail messages (cGdcA, cGucA).
    - Archive messages to other mail boxes (cGAcA, cGacA).
    - Save changes to the current mail box (cGScA, cGscA).
    - Delete the current mail box (cGDcA).
    - Visit another mail box (cGvcA).
    - Send a mail message (cGmcA).
    - Hide vm windows (cGdeletecA).

    Use the vm help page (bound to cG`esc h`cA) for further information.

    cDvmcA supports two types of embedded data, uuencode and mime encoding and
    uses lsipipe-shell-command(2)lmipipe-shell-command(2)le to extract the data, the commanding to use
    must be supplied by the user using the setup dialog, which can contain the
    following special tokens:

    cG%icA
    
       Temporary file name, if used, the embedded data is written to the this
       file first.

    cG%ocA
    
       User supplied output file name, if cG%icA is not used, the embedded data
       is written to this file first.

    cG%bcA
    
       The output base name, i.e. cG%ocA without the path.

    If no command line is supplied then the embedded data is written to the
    user supplied file name as a text file in the form found in the mail
    message.

    cDmailcA can be used to compose and send an email, it can insert embedded data
    in a similar way to cDvmcA's data extraction, the following special tokens can
    be used:

    cG%icA
    
       The user supplied data file to be embedded.

    cG%bcA
    
       The input base name, i.e. cG%icA without the path.

    cG%ocA
    
       Temporary file name used to output the processed data file, this file
       is inserted into the mail message using lsinsert-file(2)lminsert-file(2)le.

    cDmailcA also uses cDipipe-shell-commandcA to send the mail message, the following
    special tokens can be used:

    cG%fcA
    
       The from user name.

    cG%scA
    
       The email subject.

    cG%tcA
    
       A comma separated list of 'To' recipients.

    cG%ccA
    
       A comma separated list of 'Cc' recipients.

    cG%ocA
    
       A file name of the mail message.

    Any field not used in the command-line is left at the head of the mail

    The following command-line can be used on most UNIX systems to extract
    uuencoded data:

        rm -f %o ; uudecode %i ; rm -f %i


    The following command-line can be used on most UNIX systems to extract
    mime encoded data:

        rm -f /tmp/%b ; metamail -B -d -q -w -x -z %i ; mv -f /tmp/%b %o


    The following command-line can be used on most UNIX systems to uuencode a
    data file ready for it to be embedded, the original file is not changed:

        uuencode %b < %i > %o


    The following command-line can be used on most UNIX systems to send an
    email:

        /usr/lib/sendmail -oi -oem -odi -t < %o


cEEXAMPLE - WIN32 cA


    Typically the cDcygwin(1)cA utilities can be used for data insertion and
    extraction. These have the advantage of being very similar to the unix
    ones so only minor changes are required, i.e. try the following for data
    insertion and mime & uuencode extraction respectively:

        del %o ^ uudecode %i ^ del %i
        del c:\tmp\%b ^ metamail -B -d -q -w -x -z %i ^ move c:\tmp\%b %o
        uuencode %b < %i > %o


    This assumes that the shell you are using supports the cCcG^cAcA multiple
    commands on a single line feature, this is supported by cD4dos(1)cA and
    cD4nt(1)cA. If your shell does not support this feature a simple batch file
    command could be used instead.

    cDpostie(1)cA is a freely available pop3/smpt e-mail support program,
    available on the net, which can be used to provide a fully working cDvmcA on
    windows systems. As it is typically used in a dial-up connect environment,
    the cDuser-setupcA 'Queue Outgoing Mail' option will be enabled while the
    'Check Mail' and 'VM Gets Mail' will be disabled. This ensures that a
    connection is only made when the cDvmcA cCcGgcAcA command is used which sets all
    queued outgoing mail and gets any incoming mail.

    The following command-line can be used to get mail from your pop server
    using postie:

        postie -host:pop-mail-addr -user:user-addr -pass:password -file:inbox
                  "-sep:From root Mon Jan 11 20:02:02 1999" -raw -rm


    Where the cGinboxcA is the 'Incoming Mail Box' file specified in user-setup.
    The cG-sepcA option is used to partition each mail message from the previous
    message, this string is used as it is in a unix standard form so the
    resulting mail box could be understood by unix mail systems such as
    netscape etc.

    NOTE: The cD-rmcA option is used to remove the incoming mail messages from the
    server. It is strongly recommended that the system is thoroughly tested
    without this option first.

    The following command-line can be used to send mail to your smtp server
    using postie:

        postie -host:smtp-mail-addr "-from:user@mail-addr" -use_mime:0
                  "-to:%t" "-s:%s" "-cc:%c" "-file:%o"


    cDblat(1)cA is another freely available windows program which can be used to
    send mail with the following command-line:

        blat %o -f %f -s \"%s\" -t \"%t\" -c \"%c\"

$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDcollapse-currentcA  
    cDcollapse-allcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    MicroEmacs 2009 provides a generic, albeit coarse, folding mechanism which
    is applied to some of the well known file modes. The folding mechanism
    allows parts of the buffer to be scrolled up and hidden, leaving a residue
    hilighting marker within the buffer indicating a folded region. A folded
    buffer typically allows a summary of the buffer contents to be viewed
    within several windows, hiding the detail of the buffer. 

    The folding mechanism uses well defined cCstartcA and cCendcA markers which form
    part of the syntax of the well known file mode. i.e. in 'C' this is the
    open and closed braces that appear on the left-hand margin (cG{cA .. cG}cA). The
    intention is that the natural syntax of the text is used to determine the
    fold positions, requiring no additional text formating or special text
    tags to be inserted by the user.

    cDcollapse-currentcA opens and closes a folded region within the buffer. If
    the current cursor position lies between a cCstartcA and cCendcA marker then the
    region between the start and end is folded out and hidden from view,
    leaving a highlight marker in the buffer. If the fold already exists then,
    moving the cursor to the folded line and invoking cDcollapse-currentcA removes
    the fold marker and reveals the text.

    cDcollapse-allcA opens and closes all folded regions within the buffer, if the
    current state is unfolded then all of the cCstartcA/cCendcA markers are located
    and their regions folded. Conversely, if the buffer is currently folded
    and cDcollapse-allcA is invoked, then all folds are removed and the associated
    text revealed.


cECONFIGURATION cA


    In order to utilize the cDcollapse-current/allcA commands within a buffer, the
    cCstartcA and cCendcA markers have to be initialized for the syntactical contents
    of the buffer. This is performed within the hook function for the buffer,
    using the hook-name, the initialization is performed within
    lsbuffer-init(3)lmbuffer-init(3)le. Buffer specific variables are defined within the context
    of the buffer to configure that start and end fold handling. The buffer
    specific variables are defined as follows, where cCXXXcA is the file hook base
    name.

    cD.fhook-XXX-collapse-opencA
    
       A regular expression search string used to locate the start of the
       string. For speed the search string should include a regular
       expression start or end of line character whenever possible. i.e. in C
       the open is defined as cGcG^{cAcA.

    cD.fhook-XXX-collapse-closecA
    
       A regular expression search string used to locate the end of the
       string. For speed the search string should include a regular
       expression start or end line character whenever possible. i.e. in C
       the close is defined as cGcG^}cAcA.

    cD.fhook-XXX-collapse-mopencA
    
       An integer value that denotes the number of lines to move in a forward
       or (negative n) backward direction from the cCstartcA line located by the
       search string to the position in the buffer to be folded. If default
       value when cDmopencA is omitted is 0, starting the fold from the search
       string line.

    cD.fhook-XXX-collapse-mclosecA
    
       The relative displacement from the close fold line to the fold
       position, this is a positive or negative displacement depending on
       where the fold is to be positioned.

    cD.fhook-XXX-collapse-mnextcA
    
       Specifies the number of lines to advance before the next search is
       continued on the fold operation. This is only used by cDcollapse-allcA.


cEPRESENTATION cA


    The presentation of a collapsed region takes the form:

       cC<open line string>cA ... cC<close line string>cA

    Where cC<open line string>cA and cC<close line string>cA are automatically
    extracted from the originating buffer using the search string definition.
    Existing cDcollapsecA implementations used a simpler format:

       cC<open line string>cA ...

    In MicroEmacs '04 and later versions, then the cC<close line string>cA is
    always appended. Appending of the closing token is required to ensure that
    any lsindent(2)lmindentationle is maintained. This allows the indent processing to find
    both an cCopencA and cCclosecA character sequence and not introduce an unwanted
    indentation. To ensure that indentation consistency is maintained then the
    cD.fhook-XXX.collapse-closecA definition should minimally match the
    corresponding indentation close regular expression.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following examples show how the collapse variables are set up in each
    of the buffer modes.


cEC and C++  cA


    cDCcA and cDC++cA collapse on the open and close brace appearing in the left-hand
    margin. The collapse variables are defined in cGhkccA/cGhkcpp.emfcA as follows:-

sB
          set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-open  "^{"
          set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-close "^}"
          set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-mopen  "-1"
          set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-mclose "1"
          set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-mnext "-1"

sA
    Given a 'C' function definition:-

       static void
       myfunc (int a, int b)
       {
              /* Function body */
       }


    the folded version appears as follows:-

       static void
       myfunc (int a, int b) ... }


cEemf  cA


    MicroEmacs macro files cDemfcA support folding of macro definitions, the
    collapse variables are defined in cGhkemf.emfcA as follows:-

sB
          set-variable .fhook-emf.collapse-open  "^0? ?define-macro[ \t]"
          set-variable .fhook-emf.collapse-close "^!emacro"
          set-variable .fhook-emf.collapse-mclose "1"
          set-variable .fhook-emf.collapse-mnext "-1"

sA
    Given a macro definition:-

sB
          0 define-macro mymacro
          ; This is the body of the macro
          ; ... and some more ...
          !emacro

sA
    the collapsed version of the macro is defined as:-

sB
          0 define-macro mymacro ... !emacro

sA
cEnroff  cA


    cDnroffcA is configured for manual pages only and folds between cG.SHcA and cG.SScA
    sections, the hook variables are defined as follows:-

sB
          set-variable .fhook-nroff.collapse-open  "^\.S[SH]"
          set-variable .fhook-nroff.collapse-close "^\.S[SH]\|\'"
          set-variable .fhook-nroff.collapse-mnext "-1"

sA
    Given an nroff block of text defined as:-

       .SH SYNOPSIS
       .\" Some text
       .\" Some more text
       .SH DESCRIPTION


    Then the collapsed version appears as:

       .SH SYNOPSIS
       .SH DESCRIPTION


cEtcl/tk  cA


    cDtcl/tkcA is configured to collapse procedures. The collapse variables are
    defined as:-

sB
          set-variable .fhook-tcl.collapse-open  "^proc "
          set-variable .fhook-tcl.collapse-close "^}"
          set-variable .fhook-tcl.collapse-mclose "1"
          set-variable .fhook-tcl.collapse-mnext "-1"

sA
    Given a tcl procedure definition:-

       proc tixControl:InitWidgetRec {w} {
              upvar #0 $w data

              tixChainMethod $w InitWidgetRec

              set data(varInited)   0
              set data(serial) 0
       }


    The collapsed version of the same section appears as:-

       proc tixControl:InitWidgetRec {w} { ... }


cENOTES cA


    cDcollapse-currentcA and cDcollapse-allcA are macros implemented in cGcollapse.emfcA.
    The collapsing is performed using the lsnarrow-buffer(2)lmnarrow-buffer(2)le command.

    cDcollapse-currentcA may also be bound to the mouse using the lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le.
    The typical binding is cGC-mouse-drop-1cA.


cEHISTORY cA


    cDcollapsecA is the new name for cDfoldcA appearing in MicroEmacs 2004 version.
    The existing commands of cDfold-currentcA and cDfold-allcA have been replaced by
    cDcollapse-currentcA and cDcollapse-allcA respectively. cDcollapsecA now uses the
    private command variables.

    cD%man-comcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDmancA provides a mechanism to display a UNIX manual page within the
    MicroEmacs window. On invoking cDmancA the user is prompted for the name of
    the manual page to display:-

        Man on ?


    The name of the manual page (and any options) are entered on the command
    line. The macro invokes the UNIX utility cDman(1)cA to generate the page and
    displays the results in a window. The man page executable may be defined
    with the variable cD%man-comcA this is defined as cGmancA by default.

    Another manual page can be selected by either moving the cursor to the
    link and pressing return or double clicking on it with the left mouse
    button. MicroEmacs will then attempt to load and display the selected
    manual page.

    cDman-cleancA removes any man-page formatting codes from the current buffer
    reducing a manual page to plain text. The formatting codes are used to
    create the bold and underline fonts. This allows the page to be treated as
    a normal buffer, i.e. string searches and other similar command will work
    as expected.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDdrawcA provides a simple way of drawing lines into the current buffer, this
    has a variety of uses such as drawing tables. cDdrawcA copies the current
    buffer into a temporary buffer and then allows the user to draw using
    simple commands until the user either aborts, discarding any changes, or
    exits insert the changes back into the buffer.

    The keys for cDdrawcA are defined as follows:-

    cD%cygwin-promptcA "cChilightStringcA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDcygwincA creates an interactive BASH shell window within a MicroEmacs buffer
    window, providing a UNIX command line facility within the Microsoft
    Windows environment. This is a preferable environment to the MS-DOS shell
    and is certainly far more comfortable for those familiar with UNIX.

    Within the window BASH commands may be entered and executed, the results
    are shown in the window. Within the context of the BASH shell window then
    directory naming conforms to the cDcygwincA standard conventions (as opposed
    to the Microsoft directory naming).

    On running cDcygwincA a new buffer is created called cG*cygwin*cA which contains
    the shell. Executing the command again creates a new shell window called
    cG*cygwin1*cA, and so on. If a cygwin window is killed off then the available
    window is used next time the command is run.

    Additional controls are available within the shell window to control the
    editors interaction with the window. The operating mode is shown as a
    digit on the buffer mode line (2/3/4) which is defined in the following
    sections. The operational mode is changed with the cDF3cA function key.

    cDMode 2 - Browse ModecA
    
       Locks the window and allows local editing to be performed. All
       commands entered into the window are interpreted by the editor. Mode 2
       is typically entered to cut and paste from the window, search for text
       strings etc. In mode 2, a cD2cA is shown on the mode line.

    cDMode 3 - Semi-immersioncA
    
       The normal operating mode, text typed into the window is presented to
       the shell window. Translation of MicroEmacs commands (i.e.
       beginning-of-word) are translated and passed to the shell. For
       interactive use this is the default mode. In mode 3, a cD3cA is shown on
       the mode line.

    cDMode 4 - Full ImmersioncA
    
       All input is passed to the shell, no MicroEmacs commands are
       interpreted and keys are passed straight to the shell window. This
       mode is used where none of the keys to be entered are to be
       interpreted by MicroEmacs. Note that you have to un-toggle mode 4
       before you can swap buffers as this effectively locks the editor into
       the window.

    cDF5cA
    
       Clears the buffer contents. This simply erases all of the historical
       information in the buffer. The operation of the shell is unaffected.

    To exit the shell then end the shell session using cGcGexitcAcA or cGcGC-dcAcA as
    normal and then close the buffer. A short cut cG`C-c C-k`cA is available to
    kill off the pipe. However, it is not recommended that this method is used
    as it effectively performs a hard kill of the buffer and attached process

    cD%cygwin-pathcA is a user defined variable that defines the file system
    location of the cCcygwincA directory, this is typically cGc:/cygwincA. If cCcygwincA
    is located at a different location then the variable MUST be defined
    within the user start up script in order for the cDcygwincA command to start
    the shell. With a default installation of cCcygwincA then the settings are
    typically defined as:-

    cDCurrent ReleasecA

sB
          set-variable %cygwin-path "c:/cygwin"

sA
    cD%cygwin-hilightcA is a boolean flag which controls how the cygwin command
    shell window is hilighted. This value MUST be defined within the user
    start up script prior to executing cygwin if hilighting is to be disabled;
    by default hilighting is enabled. A value of 0 disables shell hilighting
    i.e.

sB
          set-variable %cygwin-hilight 0

sA
    cD%cygwin-promptcA is an optional variable that is used in conjunction with
    cD%cygwin-hilightcA, it defines the hilighting string identifying the prompt.
    This allows the prompt to be rendered with a different color. The default
    prompt is cGbash-x.yyr$cA and may be hilighted using a definition:-

sB
          set-variable %cygwin-prompt "bash-2.01$"

sA
    The user typically overrides the prompt definition within the BASH startup
    file, a more appropriate definition of the prompt may be:-

sB
          set-variable %cygwin-prompt "^[a-z]*@[^>]*>"

sA
cENOTES cA


    The cDcygwincA command uses the lsipipe-shell-command(2)lmipipe-shell-command(2)le to manage the pipe
    between the editor and the cDbashcA shell. The window is controlled by the
    macro file cGhkcygwin.emfcA which controls the interaction with the shell.

    The macro cDcygwincA in cGhkcygwin.emfcA defines the parameter setup to connect to
    the cygwin bash shell, installed in the default location cGc:/cygwincA. If
    your installation of cygwin is in a different location then correct the
    macro to match your install location, preferably correct by creating a
    cCmycygwin.emfcA file in your user directory simply containing a re-defined
    cDcygwincA macro.

    If you have exported some of the cygwin environment variables in your
    cGautoexec.batcA then you will have to figure out for yourself what variables
    macro cCcygwincA needs to export - the current configuration is for a vanilla
    install.

    The cDbashcA shell is executed with options cD-icA, for interactive shell and cD-mcA
    to enable job control.

    As of the 2004 release then the cDCygwincA/cDCygnuscA support has been revised in
    light of the changes in cDcygwincA

    - Renamed the command from cDcygnuscA to cDcygwincA.
    - Following a change in the cDbash(1)cA command line operation, which now
          no longer echos user input, then the user input is processed by
          MicroEmacs. This does cause some problems with completion as the
          Cygwin environment has a different name space. The completion still
          requires some more work, but sufficient for smaller tasks.


cETESTED CONFIGURATIONS cA


    This configuration has only been tested on a Windows 2000 installation,
    whether this works on Windows 95/98/NT is unknown while XP is very likely
    to work.

    We have only been running "make" operations in the shell and do not know
    how the likes of "more", "man" or anything other terminal interaction
    works.

    cDTested ConfigurationscA
    
        Windows 2K (Pentium-4) and Windows 2K (SunPCi-III)

       cygwin latest version as of February 2004.


cEBUGS cA


    cDBreak KeycA
    
       A break in a bash shell is cGC-ccA, the macros define the key cGC-c C-ccA to
       perform the break. There does not appear to be a way to prevent this
       from happening as trapping the interrupt does not appear to be
       supported in Cygwin Bash i.e. "cGtrapcA cG''cA cGINTcA".

    cDCompletioncA
    
       Completion processing needs to be improved. The directory location is
       retrieved from cDbash(1)cA on each command line prompt, this is used for
       file completion. There is no command completion. Room for some
       improvement here.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDishellcA  

    cC[Windows Only]cA  
    cD$ME_ISHELLcA cC= <comspec>cA 


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDishellcA creates an interactive shell window within the a MicroEmacs buffer
    window, providing access to the native operating systems command shell.
    Within the window commands may be entered and executed, the results are
    shown in the window.

    On running cDishellcA a new buffer is created called cG*shell*cA which contains
    the shell. Executing the command again creates a new shell window called
    cG*shell1*cA, and so on. If a cG*shell*cA window is killed off then the available
    window is used next time the command is run.

    Additional controls are available within the shell window to control the
    editors interaction with the window. The operating mode is shown as a
    digit on the buffer mode line (2/3/4) which is defined in the following
    sections. The operational mode is changed with the cDF3cA function key.

    cDMode 2 - Browse ModecA
    
       Locks the window and allows local editing to be performed. All
       commands entered into the window are interpreted by the editor. Mode 2
       is typically entered to cut and paste from the window, search for text
       strings etc. In mode 2, a cD2cA is shown on the mode line.

    cDMode 3 - Semi-immersioncA
    
       The normal operating mode, text typed into the window is presented to
       the shell window. Translation of MicroEmacs commands (i.e.
       beginning-of-word) are translated and passed to the shell. For
       interactive use this is the default mode. In mode 3, a cD3cA is shown on
       the mode line.

    cDMode 4 - Full ImmersioncA
    
       All input is passed to the shell, no MicroEmacs commands are
       interpreted and keys are passed straight to the shell window. This
       mode is used where none of the keys to be entered are to be
       interpreted by MicroEmacs. Note that you have to un-toggle mode 4
       before you can swap buffers as this effectively locks the editor into
       the window.

    To exit the shell then end the shell session using the normal exit command
    i.e. cGcGexitcAcA or cGcGC-dcAcA as normal and then close the buffer. A short cut "C-c
    C-k" is available to kill off the pipe. However, it is not recommended
    that this method is used as it effectively performs a hard kill of the
    buffer and attached process.


cEUNIX cA


    The UNIX environment uses the native cDptycA support of the operating system.
    The shell that is opened is determined by the conventional cG$SHELLcA
    environment variable.

    The shell window assumes that the user is running some sort of Emacs
    emulation on the command line (i.e. cGVISUAL=emacscA for cDksh(1)cA, cDzsh(1)cA,
    cDbash(1)cA, cDtsch(1)cA) and passes Emacs controls for command line editing.

    The shell window understands re-size operations and provides a limited
    decoding of the cCtermiocA characters for a VT100 screen. From within the
    shell window it is possible to run the likes of cDtop(1)cA correctly. It is
    even possible to run another MicroEmacs terminal session !!


cEWINDOWS cA


    The Windows environment provides a very poor command shell facility, this
    is more of a fundamental problem with the operating system than anything
    else. Unfortunately NT/2K/XP are no better than Windows '95/'98, stemming
    from the fact that Microsoft Windows is actually a huge Window Manager
    (hindered by legacy issues of MS-DOS).

    For those familiar with the UNIX command shell then it is strongly
    recommended that the lscygwin(3)lmcygwin(3)le BASH shell is used as an alternative. This
    is a far more responsive shell window and provides the familiar Emacs
    editing of the command line.

    The command shell under Microsoft Windows is slow and very unresponsive,
    this would appear to be a problem with the cCcommand.comcA as the same
    problems are not apparent with the lscygwin(3)lmcygwinle environment. However, the shell
    window is good for kicking off command line utilities (such as cCmakecA) or
    any command line processes that generates output on cCstdoutcA as all of the
    output is captured in the buffer window which can be scrolled backwards
    for post analysis. For this very reason it is more preferable to a
    standard MS-DOS box.

    It is not possible to run any utilities that use embedded screen control
    characters as these are not interpreted by the editor.


cEChanging the Shell  cA


    The default shell that is executed is defined by the environment variable
    cD$COMSPECcA. Where the user is using a different command shell (i.e. 4-DOS),
    then problems may arise if this is an old 16-bit executable. The shell
    that MicroEmacs executes may be overridden by setting the environment
    variable cD$ME_ISHELLcA. This is typically set in the lsme32.ini(8)lmme32.ini(8)le file i.e.

        [username]
        ME_ISHELL=c:\windows\command.com


cEBugs  cA


    cDWinOldApcA
 
       cDWinoldapcA is created by the Microsoft environment whenever a shell is
       created. On occasions where processes have terminated badly the user
       may be prompted to kill these off; this is the normal behaviour of
       Windows. It is strongly advised that the shell is always exited
       correctly (i.e. cGexitcA) before leaving the editor. The Windows operating
       system for '95/'98 is not particularly resilient to erroneous
       processes and can bring the whole system down. NT/2K/XP do not appear
       to suffer from these problems (so much).

    cDLocked InputcA
    
       There are occasions after killing a process the editor appears to lock
       up. This is typically a case that the old application has not shut
       down correctly. Kill off the erroneous task (cGAlt-Ctrl-DelcA - cCEnd TaskcA)
       then bring the editor under control using a few cGC-gcA lsabort-command(2)lmabort-command(2)le
       sequences.


cENOTES cA


    The cDishellcA command uses the lsipipe-shell-command(2)lmipipe-shell-command(2)le to manage the pipe
    between the editor and the shell. The window is controlled by the macro
    file cGhkipipe.emfcA which controls the interaction with the shell.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDdiffcA executes the cDdiff(1)cA command with the command line set by the
    ls%diff-com(5)lm%diff-com(5)le variable and the user supplied old-version and new-version.
    The output of the command is piped into the cD*diff*cA buffer and is hilighted
    to show the changes (GNU diff only).

    Your version of cDdiff(1)cA will determine whether it is possible to
    difference directories.

    cDdiff-changescA is a simple macro that differences the current buffer and the
    last backup of the associated file. It is a quick way to determine what
    has been modified recently. This macro only works if a backup file exists.

    cDrdiffcA operates in the same way as cDdiffcA except it launches the cDdiff(1)cA
    command with an extra cC-rcA option which enables recursive compare (i.e.
    compares the contents of sub-directories as well). Your version of cDdiffcA
    must support this option for cDrdiffcA to operate correctly.

    cD%diff-comcA is the command line that is used to execute a cDdiff(1)cA system
    command.

    For GNU diff then the following command line setting is recommended:-

         diff --context --minimal --ignore-space-change \
                --report-identical-files --recursive


    which should be defined in your personal user configuration. This is the
    default for Linux.


cENOTES cA


    cDdiffcA, cDdiff-changescA and cDrdiffcA are macros defined in cGtools.emfcA.

    cDdiff(1)cA must be executable on the system before diff or diff-changes can
    function.

    cDdiff(1)cA is a standard utility on UNIX systems. For Windows 95/NT a version
    of GNU cDdiffcA may be found at:

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDosd-dialogcA constructs a OSD dialog prompt with a title string cCtitlecA, a
    prompt string within the dialog of cCpromptcA. A single button, with text
    rendering cCbut1cA, is placed within the dialog. The dialog remains on the
    screen until the button is selected or the user aborts.

    cDosd-xdialogcA creates an extended dialog with multiple buttons similar to
    cDosd-dialogcA, the number of buttons created (cC#cA) is determined from the
    number of cCbutcA arguments. The cCdefaultcA integer argument specifies the
    default button (1..cC#cA), a value of 0 specifies that there is no default
    button.

    The commands return the button pressed in the variable ls$result(5)lm$result(5)le.

    cDosd-entrycA constructs a simple OSD entry dialog which prompts the user to
    type in a value. The value of the supplied variable is used as an initial
    entry value, the variable is set to the entered value when the user
    presses the cGcGOkaycAcA button but remains unchanged if the user Cancel or
    aborts.

    The size of the entry defaults to 30 characters if not specified by the
    user, when a size parameter is given it can take one of two forms, either
    simply cGcGwcAcA specifying the width, the height defaulting to 1, or "cGwcAcDxcAcGhcA"
    (i.e. cGcG40x5cAcA) specifying both. The last optional argument cCtypecA sets the
    type of value being entered (e.g. file name, buffer name, etc) see flag cDhcA
    on the help page for ls@ml(4)lm@ml(4)le for a list of entry types and the numerical
    value to be supplied.

    The argument cCncA can be used to change the default behavior of the commands
    described above, cCncA is a bit based flag where:-

    cD0x01cA
    
       Enables command abort (default), except cDosd-entrycA which ignores the
       setting of this bit. When enabled, if the user abort by either closing
       the dialog (top right button) or using the cDabort-commandcA the dialog
       command will also abort. If bit 0x01 is not set the command will not
       abort and cD$resultcA will be set to -1.

    cD0x02cA
    
       When set, flags that a dialog position has also been provided, extra
       arguments cDx-poscA and cDy-poscA must also be given. By default the dialog is
       placed under the mouse.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    A simple query dialog is typically constructed using cDosd-dialogcA, as
    follows:-

sB
          !if &seq %osd-search-str ""
              osd-dialog "Replace" "Error: Search string is empty!" "  &OK  "
              !return
          !endif

sA
    The following example uses multiple buttons within a single dialog, using
    cDosd-xdialogcA, as follows:-

sB
          0 define-macro osd-close
              !if &bmod "edit"
                  set-variable #l0 &spr "Buffer \"%s\" changed" $buffer-bname
                  osd-xdialog "Buffer Close" #l0 1 "&Save First" \
                                                  "&Loose Changes" "&Cancel"
                  !if &equ $result 3
                      !abort
                  !elif &equ $result 2
                      -1 buffer-mode "edit"
                  !else
                      !if &seq $buffer-fname ""
                          !nma write-buffer
                      !else
                          !nma save-buffer
                      !endif
                  !endif
              !endif
              delete-buffer $buffer-bname @mna
          !emacro

    The next example macro can be used to change the value of a user variable
    to a user supplied file name:

    The argument cCncA determines whether auto-spell is enabled or disabled, a
    positive argument enables and a negative argument disables. If no argument
    or cC0cA is supplied the auto-spell state is toggled.

    cDauto-spell-menucA opens the auto-spell context menu which lists suggested
    corrections for the current word and other useful auto-spell commands and
    configuration options. This menu can also be accessed via the main mouse
    context menu when the current buffer has auto spell enabled.

    cDauto-spell-buffercA checks all words within the current buffer for spell,
    hilighting any unknown or miss-spelled words found.

    cDauto-spell-resetcA resets the buffer hilighting scheme, removing any added
    erroneous words.

    cDauto-spell-ignorecA gets the current word and deletes the erroneous
    hilighting and adds the word to the current temporary ignore dictionary,
    auto-spell and the spelling-checker will now ignore the word. If an
    argument cDncA of 2 is given to the command the word is added to the users
    personal dictionary instead of the temporary ignore dictionary so the word
    is 'ignored' in all future sessions of MicroEmacs as well.

    cDzfile-setupcA "cCextensioncA" "cClist-commandcA" "cCcut-tocA"  
       "cCcolumncA" "cCfile-endcA" "cCextract-commandcA"  
       "cCremove-commandcA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDfind-zfilecA provides generic support for listing and extracting the
    contents of compressed files. cDfind-zfilecA also supports the extraction of
    the internal files into another buffer.

    cDfind-zfilecA must be configured for each compression format using
    cDzfile-setupcA. It relies on command-line programs to generate content lists
    which are used to generate the main file listing, and subsequently, the
    ability to extract individual files for file extraction support.

    For basic content listing support the first 3 arguments must be given to
    zfile-setup. The first argument "cCextensioncA" is used as the compressed file
    id string. The compressed file type is derived from the file extension,
    e.g. cGcGzipcAcA or cGcGZcAcA for UNIX compressed files. The exact case of the
    extension is checked first, followed by the lower case and upper case
    string.

    The compressed file contents list is generated from executing the user
    supplied "cClist-commandcA" and dumping the output into the list buffer. The
    command is run from the directory containing the compressed file and the
    following special tags may be used within the "cClist-commandcA" which get
    substituted as follows:-

    cD%zbcA
    
       The token is replaced with the compressed files base name, i.e. the
       file name without the path.

    cD%zfcA
    
       The token is replaced with the compressed files absolute file name,
       i.e. the file complete with the path.

    The head of the list output is often unwanted verbose printout, this can
    be automatically be removed by the use of the "cCcut-tocA" argument. The
    argument, if supplied (not an empty string), must be a lsRegularExpressions(2)lmregexle search string
    matching the start of the required list. If found, all text before it is
    removed.

    For single file extraction support the last 4 arguments must be specified
    by cDzfile-setupcA. The file to extract is selected either by selecting the
    file name using the left mouse button or by moving the cursor to the line
    containing the file name and pressing the cGcGreturncAcA key.

    cDfind-zfilecA assumes that the file name starts at a fixed column number,
    specified with the "cCcolumncA" argument. The end of the file name is obtained
    by searching for the regular expression "cCfile-endcA" string, the file name
    is assumed to end at the start of the search string match.

    The file is then extracted by executing the supplied "cCextract-commandcA" and
    then loading the extracted file into a new buffer. The command is run from
    the system temporary directory (i.e. cGcG/tmp/cAcA on UNIX or cG$TEMPcA on Windows
    etc.). The following special tags may be used within the "cCextract-commandcA"
    which get substituted as follows:-

    cD%zbcA
    
       The token is replaced with the compressed files base name, i.e. the
       file name without the path.

    cD%zfcA
    
       The token is replaced with the compressed files absolute file name,
       i.e. the file name complete with the path.

    cD%fbcA
    
       The name of the file to be extracted.

    The file is assumed to be extracted to the temp directory due to the way
    the command is run, this file is then loaded into a new buffer. The
    temporary file should then be removed using the supplied "cCremove-commandcA"
    with is run from the temp directory, the "cD%fbcA" special tag may be used in
    the command. This argument may be given as an empty string, thereby
    disabling the removal.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    For zip file support the freely available cDunzip(1)cA command can be used,
    following is the list of arguments with suitable entries:

       extension           zip
       list-command        unzip -v %zb
       cut-to              ^ Length
       column              58
       file-end            $
       extract-command     unzip -o %zf %fb
       remove-command      rm %fb


    For the zip file "cC/usr/jasspa/memacros.zipcA", after substitution the list
    command becomes cG`unzip -v memacros.zip`cA which will be executed in the
    "cC/usr/jasspa/cA" directory. This will produce the following form of output:

       Archive:  memacros.zip

    The top Archive line is not require, this is automatically removed by
    setting the "cCcut-tocA" to cG`^ Length`cA which matches the start of the next
    line.

    For file extract, consider the file cGcGctags.emfcAcA, the first character cCcGccAcA
    is at column 58 and the first character after the end of the file name is
    the end-of-line character (cCcG\ncAcA) which is matched by the lsRegularExpressions(2)lmregexle string "$",
    hence the settings on "cCcolumncA" and "cCfile-endcA". When this and the zip file
    name are substituted into the extract-command, it becomes "unzip -o
    /usr/jasspa/memacros.zip calc.emf" and is run from the "cC/tmp.cA" directory.
    Note that the cGcG-ocAcA option disables any overwrite prompts, these are not
    required as tests and prompting have already been performed by cDfind-zfilecA.
    The extracted file "cC/tmp/calc.emfcA" is then loaded into a new buffer. 

    The temporary file is removed by executing the substituted remove-command
    which becomes cG`rm calc.emf`cA from the cGcG/tmp/cAcA directory.

    For gzipped tar files, extension "cDtgzcA" the following setup can be used on
    UNIX platforms:

       extension           tgz
       list-command        unzip -v %zb
       cut-to
       column              43
       file-end            $
       extract-command     gunzip -c %zf | tar xof - %fb
       remove-command      rm %fb


    For the tgz file "cC/usr/jasspa/memacros.tgzcA", this will produce the
    following listing:

       tgz file: /usr/jasspa/memacros.tgz

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDcharset-changecA opens a dialog allowing the user to select a cDFromcA and cDTocA
    character set. If the cCConvertcA button is selected the current buffer is
    converted to the destination character set. The command assumes that the
    current buffer is written in the cDFromcA character set, no attempt is made to
    verify this.

    cDcharset-iso-to-usercA converts the current buffer, assumed to be in
    ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) font format, to the current user's character set
    (defined by lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le). This process typically corrects any foreign
    language display problems.

    Conversely, cDcharset-user-to-isocA converts the current buffer from the
    user's character set to ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1), this is typically used for
    the transfer of text files between different systems.

    The utf8 conversion functions can be used to convert UTF-8 characters to the 
    ISO or Windows encoding selected currently in lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le. 
    The UTF-8 characters can't be displayed by MicroEmacs - so they should be converted 
    usually using these  functions. 
    To  convert  your  current  opened  file  into the  current  character set from
    UTF-8  Unicode  you use  the  function  cDcharset-utf8-to-isocA.  In case of
    trouble  you might get an empty  buffer, you should  then reload the current
    file without saving it.
    
    If you your file mainly has non-Unicode characters you might just ignore the few 
    Unicode characters. The function cDcharset-iso-to-utf8cA is usually used at the end to export
    a file back into the UTF-8 encoding.

    The current character set is configured using the lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le dialog
    (see lsuser-setup(3)lmDisplay Font Setle). This in turn uses the command lsset-char-mask(2)lmset-char-mask(2)le to
    create the low level character conversion tables.

$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDexecute-toolcA "cCtool-namecA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDexecute-toolcA launches a predefined shell tool, the tools are typically
    defined by the lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le Tools page and executed using the MicroEmacs
    main Tools menu. See help on lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le for more information on the
    basic facilities given by execute-tool.

    If the numeric argument cCncA is supplied it is used as the tool name to be
    executed, otherwise the argument "cCtool-namecA" must be given.

    A tool with a numeric name can be executed via a key binding, for example,
    to execute tool cD3cA (as defined by cDuser-setupcA) to cCcGC-3cAcA add the following
    line to the user setup file:-

sB
          3 global-bind-key execute-tool "C-3"

sA
cENOTES cA


    The registry entries for a tool must be located in registry directory
    "cG/history/cAcD$platformcA__/tool/cD__tool-namecD" where cA$platformcA is the current setting
    of variable ls$platform(5)lm$platform(5)le and cDtool-namecA is the name of the tool as given to
    the command. The following registry entries are used:-

    cDnamecA
    
       The name of the tool as displayed in the user-setup Tools dialog and
       the Main Tools menu. This is only used for tools cG0cA to cG9cA.

    cDcommandcA
    
       The command-line to be launched when the tool is executed, the
       following special tokens may be used in the command-line which are
       substituted at execution:-

       cD%ffcA
              The current buffer's full file name, including the path.

       cD%fpcA
              The current buffer's file path.

       cD%fncA
              The current buffer's file name without the path.

       cD%fbcA
              The current buffer's file base name, i.e. the file name without
              the path or the extension.

       cD%fecA
              The current buffer's file extension with the '.' (e.g. ".emf"),
              set to the empty string if the file name does not have an
              extension.

       Note that "cD%ffcA" is always the same as "cD%fp%fncA" and "cD%fp%fb%fecA". If any
       of these tokens are used, the tool will fail to execute if the current
       buffer does not have a file name.

    cDflagcA
    
       A bit based flag setting the tool characteristics, where:-

       cD0x01cA 
              Enable current buffer saving.

       cD0x02cA
              Enable prompt before saving current buffer.

       cD0x04cA 
              Enable all edited buffers saving.

       cD0x08cA
              Enable prompt before saving an edited buffer.

       cD0x10cA
              Enable output capturing.

       cD0x20cA
              Enable concurrent running, not available on all platforms, see
              variable ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le.

    cDbnamecA
    
       The name of the buffer to be used if the output is captured. The
       following special tokens may be used in the buffer name which are
       substituted at execution:-

       cD%fncA
    
         The current buffer's file name without the path, set to the buffer
          name if the current buffer does not have a file name.

       cD%fbcA

         The current buffer's file base name, i.e. the file name without
          the path or the extension. Set to the buffer name if the current
          buffer does not have a file name.

       cD%fecA
    
         The current buffer's file extension with the '.' (e.g. ".emf"),
          set to the empty string if the current buffer does not have a file
          name or it does not have an extension.
    
       Note that "cD%fncA" is always the same as "cD%fb%fecA". Default buffer name
       when this field is left empty is "cC*command*cA", or "cC*icommand*cA" if Run
       Concurrently is enabled.

    If more than 10 tools are required (maximum number definable by
    cDuser-setupcA) or names are preferred, it is recommended that the cDuser-setupcA
    dialog is used to define the tool and then use the registry copy utility
    bound to cCcGccAcA in a lslist-registry(2)lmlist-registry(2)le buffer.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDinfocA interprets the GNU cCinfocA pages, and presents the info file information
    within a buffer window called `*info XXXXX`, where cGXXXXXcA is the name of the
    info file. The root of the info page is displayed and may be traversed by
    selecting the links with the mouse, or by using the standard cCinfocA
    traversal keys.

    The root of the cCinfocA tree is, by default, a file called cDdircA, which points
    to the other information sources. The default search paths for the cCinfocA
    directories are:-

        `c:/info` - MS-DOS and MS-Windows (all).
        `/usr/local/info` - All UNIX platforms.

    The root directory may also be specified with the cG$INFOPATHcA environment
    variable. This is a colon (cG:cA) or semi-colon (cG;cA) separated list of
    directory paths which specify the locations of the info files, for UNIX
    and Microsoft DOS/Windows environment's, respectively.

    cDinfo-oncA gets info on a user specified top level topic, e.g. cGcGgcccAcA, the
    info file "cCtopic-strcAcG.infocA" must be found in the info search path.

    cDinfo-goto-linkcA gets and displays info on a user specified link or subject.

    cDinfocA is a macro implemented in file cGinfo.emfcA.

    When an cDinfocA command is run for the first time, the info search path is
    constructed and stored locally in the command variable cD.info.pathcA. This
    variable must be directly changed by the user if changes to the info
    search path are required.

    cDgdiffcA "cCversion1cA" "cCversion2cA"
|%gdiff-com
    cG%gdiff-comcA "cCstringcA"; Default is cG`diff -c -w`cA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDgdiffcA is a macro utility that facilitates the merging of two files
    (typically with different modification revisions). The changes between the
    revisions are hilighted with color, allowing modification regions and
    lines to be selected for the generation of a newer revision file, which
    might encompass selected modifications from each of the base revisions.

    cDgdiffcA executes the cDdiff(1)cA command with the command line set by the
    ls%gdiff-com(5)lm%gdiff-com(5)le variable and the user supplied version1 and version2. The
    output is displayed in two buffer windows, side by side, and the
    differences in the lines are hilighted to show the changes. In addition
    the content of the two buffers is cCnormalizedcA such that both windows are
    aligned at the same line position, allowing the changes in the text to be
    viewed in both windows at the same time. 

    Whilst in cDgdiffcA view mode then both scroll bars (if visible) are cClockedcA,
    such that either scrolls BOTH windows at the same time. Other key commands
    are disabled, as are the menu interactions. The short cut keys are defined
    as follows:-

    cGesc h/A-hcA - View the help page.
    
       Invokes the display of a OSD help box, summarizing the interaction
       commands

    cGC-upcA - Move to previous difference
    
       Moves to the previous changed region above the current cursor
       position.

    cGC-downcA - Move to next difference
    
       Moves to the next changed region below the current cursor position.

    cGleft mouse buttoncA  
    cGspacecA  
    cGentercA  
    cGrcA - Select difference version
 
       Selects the difference version of the currently selected window. The
       region is hilighted as the required region to be incorporated into the
       new revision.

    cGRcA - Select neither version.
    
       Marks both regions as not required.

    cGlcA - Line select current version
    
       Selects the current line from the region as being included, without
       including ALL of the region modifications.

    cGLcA - Line select neither version
    
       Discards lines from both revisions of the file.

    cGgcA - Globally selects the current version.
    
       Shortcut allows ALL modifications to the current side to be accepted.
       This is typically the fastest method to select all changes, minor
       region adjustment may then be performed on those regions which are
       inappropriately included by the selection.

    cGGcA - Globally selects neither version.
    
       Marks all regions as not being acceptable.

    cGC-x C-scA - Save current side
    
       Saves the current window to the specified file, merging the selected
       changes between the two revisions. Note that the save only operates
       iff all hilighted changes have been selected.

    cGC-x C-wcA - Save current side as
    
       Same as cDSave current sidecA except the user is prompted to enter a new
       filename to which the modifications are written.

    cGC-x kcA - Exit graphical diff
    
       Exits the cDgdiffcA utility.


cEHilighting  cA


    The hilighting within the windows is dependent upon the color scheme
    selected, in general the following hilights apply:-

    normal text
    
       No change

    cyan/grey
    
       Addition/removal of line(s)/region(s) between files.

    yellow
    
       Modification in line(s)/region(s).

    green/red

       Selected region, red or green is attributed to a selection for each
       window.


cENOTES cA


    cDgdiffcA is a macro defined in cGgdiff.emfcA, inspired by the GNU utility of the
    same name cDgdiff(1)cA

    cDdiff(1)cA must be executable on the system before cDgdiffcA can function. The
    cDdiff(1)cA invocation must include the cCcontextcA difference, which annotates
    the differences with a cG+cA, cG-cA or cG!cA markers. cDdiff(1)cA is typically invoked
    with the options cD-c -wcA.

    cDdiff(1)cA is a standard utility on UNIX systems. For Windows 95/NT a version
    of GNU cDdiffcA may be found at:

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDexpand-iso-accentscA  
    cCncA cDiso-accents-modecA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDexpand-iso-accentscA provides a facility to enter a plain text
    representation of an ISO accent and then to expand it into a proper ISO
    accented character. For example:-

       ``a` => small a, grave accent
       `^a` => small a, circumflex accent
       `'a` => small a, acute accent
       `"a` => small a, umlaut
       `~a` => small a, tilde
       `.a` => small a, ring
       `14` => fraction, one-quater
       `12` => fraction, one-half
       `34` => fraction, three-quaters
       `ae` => ae ligature
       `sz` => small sz ligature, German.
       `+-` => plus or minus (math.)
       `co` => copyright
       `rg` => registered trademark
       `tm` => trade mark
       `oe` => small oe ligature
       `/o` => small o, slash

    The cDexpand-iso-accentscA can be called directly to expands the ISO
    abbreviated character sequence into it's ISO ASCII character equivalent.
    The command looks at the 2 characters to the left of the cursor and tries
    to find a matching abbreviation, if found the 2 characters are removed,
    replaced by the single ISO character.

    The more typical way of using this feature is by enabling its use in the
    lsexpand-abbrev-handle(3)lmabbreviation handlerle which is usually bound to "esc esc ". It can be
    enabled by either by using the cDiso-accents-modecA command or, for a more
    permanent installation, from the lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le => General => Abbrev
    Expansion settings.

    When using the cDiso-accents-modecA command, if a numeric argument cCncA is given
    (the value is not used) then the ISO accent expansion is installed locally
    into the current buffer. If cCncA is omitted then expansion is
    enabled/disabled globally (across all buffers).

    cDexpand-iso-accentscA is the macro command that This is by default bound to .
    If an ISO character is not located then lsexpand-abbrev(2)lmexpand-abbrev(2)le is invoked to try
    a standard abbreviation.


cENOTES cA


    cDiso-accents-modecA and cDexpand-iso-accentscA are implemented as macros in the
    file cGabbrev.emfcA, the repertoire of expansions may be enhanced by editing
    this file.

    Unlike the general lsexpand-abbrev(2)lmexpand-abbrev(2)le command which attempts to expand the
    current word, cDexpand-iso-accentscA only considers the last two characters
    regardless of whether they are word characters or start a word. Therefore
    the general cDexpand-abbrevcA command cannot be used to implement a similar
    feature.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDexpand-abbrev-handlecA (cDesc esccA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDexpand-abbrev-handlecA pulls together all forms of abbreviation expansion
    into a single command so that it can be bound to a single key. The
    abbreviation must be an alpha-numeric string and the cursor must be one
    position to the right of the abbreviation (which must not be
    alpha-numeric) when this command is called. The command attempts to expand
    the abbreviation using the following commands in turn:

    lsexpand-abbrev(2)lmexpand-abbrev(2)le

       Uses a buffer specific and global abbreviation files, if set, to look
       up the abbreviation. The use of the abbreviation file can be disabled
       using lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le.

    lsexpand-iso-accents(3)lmexpand-iso-accents(3)le

       Expands ISO accent letter if the expansion mode is enabled via either
       the lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le General Page or by using the lsiso-accents-mode(3)lmiso-accents-mode(3)le
       command.

    lsexpand-look-back(3)lmexpand-look-back(3)le

       Looks for a word starting the same in the current buffer's last 100
       lines, this can be enabled in the lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le General page.

    cDBuffer specific expansioncA

       Executes a buffer specific abbreviation expansion if the current
       buffer's lsfileHooks(2)lmfile hookle supports abbreviation expansion.

    cDWord expansioncA

       If the current buffer does not support file type specific expansion
       and Word Expansion is enabled via the lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le General page
       (cGDict'ncA setting) expansion is attempted using the lsexpand-word(3)lmexpand-word(3)le
       command which expands the current partial word using the dictionary of
       the user's current language; warning - this can be slow!

    ftp - Initiate an FTP connection
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDftpcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDftpcA initiates a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) connection to a remote host
    on the network. Using FTP, editing of files may be performed in much the
    same way as on the local file system. Directory listings may be retrieved
    and traversed using the mouse or cursor keys. Using the directory listing,
    files may be transfered to/from the remote host to the local machine.

    On issuing the command then a dialog is presented to the user which is
    used to open the connection. The dialog entries are defined as follows:-

    cDRegistry FilecA
    
       The name of a MicroEmacs registry file which is used to store the FTP
       information. If a registry name is provided then all FTP address
       information is stored in the registry file and saved for later
       sessions. Be aware that password information is saved in this file as
       plain text if a password is entered into the site information.

       If the registry information is omitted then the information is not
       saved between sessions.

    cDSite NamecA
    
       An ASCII pseudo name for the remote host. The pull-down menu may be
       used to select existing sites that have been previously entered.

    cDHost AddresscA
    
       The address of the host, this may be an IP address (cG111.222.333.444cA)
       or a DNS name (i.e. cGftp.mysite.comcA).

    cDUser NamecA
    
       The login name for the site. If this is omitted then ls$user-name(5)lm$user-name(5)le is
       used by default.

    cDPasswordcA
    
       The password used to enter the site for the given login name. If the
       password is NOT supplied then the user is prompted for the password
       when a transaction takes place. If the password is omitted and left to
       promt then it is not stored in the registry.

       Take note of the comments provided above regarding the password
       information.

    cDInitial Host PathcA
    
       The starting directory at the remote host. If this is omitted then the
       root directory (cCcG/cAcA) is used by default.

    On selecting cDConnectcA then a FTP connection is opened and the initial
    directory appears as a directory listing, if the initial path is a file
    then the file is loaded into the editor.

    Thereafter the file may be edited within the editor as normal, on a write
    operation then the file is written back to the host, via FTP.

    On opening a FTP connection the progress of the transfer, and the FTP
    commands issued, may be viewed in the cG*ftp-console*cA buffer. This buffer
    may automatically appear depending upon the value of the ls%ftp-flags(5)lm%ftp-flags(5)le
    variable.


cENOTES cA


    cDftpcA is a macro implemented in cGftp.emfcA. This uses the underlying command
    lsfind-file(2)lmfind-file(2)le to implement the FTP transfer.

    FTP files can be directly loaded and edited using the standard file
    commands such as lsfind-file(2)lmfind-file(2)le.

    The FTP addresses are retained in a registry file (see lserf(8)lmerf(8)le). The
    registry file is automatically loaded when MicroEmacs starts up each
    session. The current site information may be viewed using lslist-registry(2)lmlist-registry(2)le
    and is located at the following registry addresses:-

    cD/urlcA
    
       Data value is file system location of the FTP registry file.

    cD/url/ftp/cA_<hostName>_
    
       The name of the host to which the connection is to be made.

    cD/url/ftp/cA_<hostName>cD_/hostcA
    
       The name or IP address of the remote host

    cD/url/ftp/cA_<hostName>cD_/usercA
    
       The user name used to log into the remote host.

    cD/url/ftp/cA_<hostName>cD_/passcA
    
       The user password to the remote host. If this entry is empty then the
       user is always prompted for the password when the connection is made.

    cD/url/ftp/cA_<hostName>cD_/pathcA
    
       The initial path at the remote site.

    When a FTP connection is initiated then the connection (socket) remains
    open for a period of approximately 4 minutes from the last transfer time,
    after that the connection is automatically closed and is re-initiated if
    required again.

    cDNOTE:cA For windows platforms then the resultant executable must be built
    with URL support enabled, for UNIX platforms socket support is
    automatically enabled.


cEBUGS cA


    Directory completion is not available when the current working directory
    is an FTP address. To work around this from the command line, select
    cG<RETURN>cA to get a directory listing of the current directory and select
    the file(s) from the directory to load.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDdisplay-whitespacescA toggles the displaying of white characters in the main

    represented with invisible characters such as one or more cC` `cAs for spaces
    and tabs and text moving to the next line for new-lines. The user can make
    this characters become 'visible' using this function.

    When this function is first called it toggle enables the displaying of
    these characters, other characters are drawn in their place to make them
    visible. A subsequent call will disable the displaying of them.


cENOTES cA


    cDdisplay-whitespacescA is a macro implemented in cGmisc.emfcA and uses bit
    cG0x80000cA of the ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le variable.

    The displaying of white characters can be enabled or disabled at start-up
    using lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le.

    This feature may be more confusing on some terminals due to the lack of
    characters available for displaying the white characters. The characters
    used when displaying white characters are defined in the variable
    ls$window-chars(5)lm$window-chars(5)le.

    cCncA cDreread-filecA
|reread-all
    cCncA cDreread-allcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDreread-filecA reloads from disk the file associated with the current buffer,
    this command is particularly useful when the file is continually updated
    by an external program. If the buffer has been edited and its name does
    not start with a cCcG*cAcA then the user is prompted as to whether the changes
    should be discarded. Also if the buffer has an active process running in
    it then confirmation is sort from the user before the process is killed.

    The argument cCncA can be used to change the default behavior of reread-file
    described above, cCncA is a bit based flag where:-

    cD0x01cA
    
       Enables loss of work checks (default), if this flag is not supplied
       then the buffer is reread without any user prompts (useful in macros).

    cDreread-allcA reloads all out-of-date buffers. If the argument cCncA is specified
    as zero (0) then all buffers are re-read. The default with no numeric
    argument is reload out-of-date buffers only.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDnormal-tabcA insert a tab into the current buffer by temporarily disabling
    any auto indentation schemes. The macro first disables any indentation
    rules by setting ls$buffer-indent(5)lm$buffer-indent(5)le to 0 the command lstab(2)lmtab(2)le is then called
    with the given argument cCncA. This means that the buffer's lstab(2m)lmtab(2m)le mode
    setting will be respected, i.e. whether a tab character or spaces are
    inserted. The initial indentation rules are restored on exit.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDperldbcA [ "cCscript-namecA" ] "cCscript-argscA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDperldbcA provides an editor interface to the Perl debugger, on running the
    command an interactive shell window is opened to the debugger command line
    interface. MicroEmacs then interprets the information from the debugger
    interface and opens files and hilights the current line as required. The
    current line is maintained while single stepping through the script.

    Buffers opened and referenced by the debugger have the key cGF9cA bound to
    setting a break point, this only works if the buffer contains the current
    execution point.

    If an argument cCncA of 2 is given to cDperldbcA the command assumes that the
    current buffer is the script file to debug, the cGcGscript-namecAcA argument is
    not prompted for.

    generate-tags-file - Generate a tags file
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDgenerate-tags-filecA [ "cCtag-commandcA" ]


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDgenerate-tags-filecA command provides an interface to tag file
    generation. Typically the "cCtag-commandcA" argument will not be required as
    the current buffer will automatically configure cDgenerate-tags-filecA on how
    tags are generated for the current buffer's file type. See the notes below
    for more information on configuration.

    cDgenerate-tags-filecA supports two different methods of tag generation,
    firstly via a MicroEmacs macro file and secondly by an external shell
    command (such as cDctags(1)cA). It is generally configured in the current
    buffer's lsfileHooks(2)lmsetup hookle.

    If a macro file is used a setup dialog is opened if an argument of 0 is
    given to cDgenerate-tagscA. This dialog can be used to configure which type of
    tags are required and the starting directory (useful when using recursive
    tags over a source tree). Note that not all tag types are available for
    all file types.

    The generated tags file can then be used by the lsfind-tag(2)lmfind-tag(2)le command.


cENOTES cA


    cDgenerate-tags-filecA is a macro defined in file cGgentags.emfcA.

    cDgenerate-tags-filecA can be configured in one of 2 ways:

       When a MicroEmacs macro file (such as cGctags.emfcA) is to be used, simply
       give the name of the macro file to be run as the "cCtag-commandcA"
       argument. Alternatively set the variable cD.cA_<$buffer-fhook>cD_.tagscA to this
       name, e.g. for C files

sB
                  set-variable .fhook-c.tags "ctags"

sA
       Note the cGcG.emfcAcA extension is assumed.

       When an external shell command is to be used, set the cCtag-commandcA to
       the shell command-line prefixed with a cCcG!cAcA character, for example to
       use cDctags(1)cA try the following:

sB
                  set-variable .fhook-c.tags "!ctags *.c *h"

sA
       Note that the generate-tags dialog is not available in this mode of
       execution.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cvs and sub-commands provide MicroEmacs with an interface to cDcvs(1)cA.
    cDCVScA is a version control system; using it, you can record the history of
    your source file modifications. CVS is licensed under the GNU General
    Public License and is freely available on the Internet, see the
    documentation provided with CVS for more information on its features and
    use.

    The MicroEmacs cDcvscA command opens up a modified lsfile-browser(3)lmfile-browser(3)le with an
    additional cGcG*cvs-console*cAcA window. The cGcG*files*cAcA window includes
    additional columns showing the CVS state, revision and repository date.
    The browser by default opens with 3 windows including a representation of
    the file tree. When cDcvscA is provided with a numeric argument cCncA of zero (0)
    then a single window displaying the directory is used only (i.e. cD0 cvscA)

    The functionality of the file-browser is the same as a non-CVS folder with
    the exception that additional CVS item controls are located in the mouse
    context menu (opened by clicking the right mouse button in the cG*files*cA
    buffer). This menu item opens another sub-menu providing access to the
    items below. When selecting commands than a pop-up check-box may be
    displayed which allows options to be selected for the command.

    cDCurrent StatecA
    
       Checks the state of selected file(s) or directory against the
       repository. Differences detected are shown in the cG*cvs-state*cA window.
       This provides a quick method of determining the working directory
       state.

       The cG*cvs-state*cA buffer supports some of the same features as a
       directory listing, the files can be loaded (using cGreturncA or left click
       on the file name), selected (using space or left mouse button on the
       left hand edge) and CVS commands executed from the window operate
       either on the selected files or the listed files if no files are
       selected. This runs the command cG`cvs -nq update <files>`cA.

    cDCheckout filescA
    
       Checks out a file or directory from the repository into the current
       directory. The file or directory is specified by typing the name into
       a dialog which is opened when this option is selected. This runs the
       command cG`cvs checkout <file>`cA.

    cDUpdate filescA
    
       Updates the currently selected files, files are selected by clicking
       the left button to the left of the required file name. Multiple files
       may be selected by 'dragging' a hilight region over the required
       files. This runs the command cG`cvs update <files>`cA.

    cDCommit filescA
    
       Commits any changes made to the selected files back to the CVS
       repository. This runs the command cG`cvs commit <files>`cA. The user is
       prompted for the message to add on the commit.

    cDDiff filescA
    
       Displays any differences between the selected files and the CVS
       repository version in the cC*cvs-console*cA window. This runs the command
       cG`cvs diff <files>`cA.

    cDLog filescA
    
       Displays the CVS logs for the selected files in the cC*cvs-console*cA
       window. This runs the command cG`cvs log <files>`cA.

    cDStatus filescA
    
       Displays the CVS status for each of the selected files in the
       cC*cvs-console*cA window. This runs the command cG`cvs status -v <files>`cA.

    cDTag filescA
    
       Adds, removes or moves a CVS tag on the selected file(s) or
       directories. A pop-up window is displayed which allows entry of the
       tag name and define the operation. This runs the command "cvs tag
       <files>".

    cDAdd filescA
    
       Adds the selected files to the CVS repository. Note this command only
       performs the local add, a cDCVS commitcA is required to make the addition
       permanent. This runs the command cG`cvs add <files>`cA. A pop-up is
       displayed to allow the user to change the mode of the add to binary or
       text.

    cDRemove filescA
    
       This command is deliberately not implemented as its far to dangerous!
       Instead it opens a dialog informing the user to use the cDcvs-removecA
       command instead.

    cDGraphical diffcA
    
       This command opens a lsgdiff(3)lmgdiff(3)le window showing the differences between
       the currently selected file and the CVS repository version. Note this
       command only works with a single file.

    cDResolve conflictscA
    
       This command may be used to resolve merge conflicts created by a cCCVScA
       cCupdatecA operation. The command opens a lsgdiff(3)lmgdiff(3)le window showing the
       areas of conflict allowing the user to select the correct version and
       saving the resultant version back to the local file. Note this command
       only works with a single file.

    cDClear cvs consolecA
    
       Clears the cC*cvs-console*cA buffer.

    The cDcvs-addcA command adds the current buffers file to the repository. Note
    that this command only performs the local addition, a cCCVScA cCcommitcA is
    required to make the addition permanent.

    The cDcvs-checkoutcA command checks out a file or directory from the
    repository into the current directory. The user specifies the file on the
    message line.

    The cDcvs-commitcA command commits any changes made to the currently buffer's
    file (including additions) to the repository. The user is prompted for a
    commit log message.

    The cDcvs-diffcA command opens a cC*cvs-diff*cA window displaying the differences
    between the current buffer's local file and repository version. If the
    current buffer is a directory list it will list all the differences found
    in all files within the directory.

    The cDcvs-gdiffcA command opens a lsgdiff(3)lmgdiff(3)le window displaying the differences
    between the current buffer's local file and repository version.

    The cDcvs-logcA command opens a cC*cvs-log*cA window displaying the CVS log of the
    current buffer's file.

    The cDcvs-removecA command removes the current buffer's file from the
    repository - PLEASE NOTE THIS CAN LEAD TO LOST DATA!!! This command only
    performs the local removal; as it deletes the buffer and file the
    cDcvs-commitcA command cannot be used to commit the removal to the CVS
    repository. Instead the main cDcvscA file-browser menu or cDcvs(1)cA itself must
    be used.

    The cDcvs-resolve-conflictscA command may be used to resolve any conflicts
    created by CVS when the current buffer's file is updated. The command
    opens a gdiff window displaying the areas of conflict, the user may then
    select the correct version in each case and save the resultant new version
    over the local file.

    The cDcvs-statecA command opens a cC*cvs-state*cA window listing the state of any
    file in the current directory which is not up-to-date. Note that unlike
    most cvs sub commands this command executes over all files in the current
    buffer's file directory.

    The cDcvs-statuscA command opens a cC*cvs-state*cA window and shows the state of
    the current buffer in the window including the modification state,
    repository etc.

    The cDcvs-tagcA command opens a dialog box and allows the user to add, remove
    or delete a CVS tag.

    The cDcvs-updatecA command updates all files in the current directory, the
    output being reported to a new cC*cvs-update*cA window. Note that unlike most
    cvs sub commands this command executes over all files in the current
    buffer's file directory.


cESetup  cA


    cDcvs-setupcA provides a dialog interface to configure the MicroEmacs CVS
    interface if required. On a typical system installation then it is
    sufficient to have cD$CVSROOTcA defined in the environment and the CVS tools
    will operate from this environment variable without any further
    configuration of MicroEmacs. If MicroEmacs CVS configuration is provided
    then this will over-ride the environment variable.

    cDcvs-setupcA may also be accessed from lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le from the cDMiscellaneouscA
    configuration. The the dialog provides the following configuration
    controls:

    cDCVS Command SetupcA

       cGCVSROOTcA
    
        If set, overrides the CVS $CVSROOT environment variable.

       cGCVS_RSHcA
    
        If set, overrides the CVS $CVS_RSH environment variable. rsh.

       `CVS Command`
    
        Defines the cvs(1) system command. The default when not defined is
         cvs.

       cGCompressioncA
    
        Sets the compression level to use with all CVS commands.

       `Quieter CVS output`
    
         When enabled the -q CVS command-line option is used to suppress
          some of the more verbose print-out.


cECVS File Browser  cA


    The cDCVS File BrowsercA is an extension to the lsfile-browser(3)lmfile-browser(3)le and shows the
    state of CVS files in a directory listing.

    `Quick browser mode`
    
       When enabled the CVS file browser does not launch a cvs command to
       determine the current state of all files in the directory, instead it
       extracts as much information as it can from the local file system,
       inserting cCcGQcAcAs for information it cannot determine. This is useful
       when the connection to the server is slow. The full CVS information
       can be obtained by executing the command cDcvs-full-rereadcA, typically
       bound to cGC-f5cA.

    cDTool DefaultscA
    
       The following define the default settings for options used in various
       CVS commands:

        `Recurse into sub-directories`

        `Check-out missing directories`

        `Prune empty directories`


cENOTES cA


    cDcvscA and sub-commands are macros defined in file cGcvs.emfcA.

    When filtering is enabled in the file browser the filter used by the CVS
    interface depends on the file browser mode, if cDQuick browser modecA is
    enabled the same filter is used, but when disabled all files ignored by
    cDcvs(1)cA are also removed by the filter. Use lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le in the buffer
    to enable/disable the filter.

    cDitem-listcA (cDF7cA)  
    cDitem-list-findcA  
    cDitem-list-closecA (cDesc F7cA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDitem-listcA performs a regular expression search of a buffer, presenting a
    list of the located text and associated types in a separate window which
    is presented to the left of the buffer window. cDitem-listcA is a generic
    function that interacts with the buffer environment variables to present
    abbreviated buffer information to the user.

    The regular expression search strings are predefined in the language
    templates. To add support for a new buffer type a list of search/replace
    strings must be created. The search strings must use regex (magic mode)
    and groups cG\(..\)cA to place the located object string into the replace
    string. Within the template buffer search strings (cDscA) and replace (cDrcA) are
    defined with the following syntax:-

        set-variable ._hookname_.item-list-s_x_ "_regexp_"
        set-variable ._hookname_.item-list-r_x_ "_replace_"

    Where:-

    cChooknamecA
    
       The name of the file hook i.e. cGfhook-ccA for ANSI 'C'.

    cCxcA
    
       The search number, this is valid in the range 1..9, commencing from 1.
       The search is processed in the order of the numeric identity.

    cCregexpcA
    
       The regular expression to search for. One of the arguments must
       include a groups cG\(..\)cA definition to allow the string to be moved to
       the replace.

    cCreplacecA
    
       The replace string, this typically includes a cCtypecA and part of the
       search string.

    On invocation of cDitem-listcA the buffer is searched and the results are
    presented in the cG*item-list*cA window appearing at the left-hand side of the
    window. If there is no item list set up for the file type then an error
    message is displayed.

    The user may interact with the cG*item-list*cA buffer using the mouse or
    cG<RETURN>cA, on selecting a line then the user is moved to the corresponding
    line in the original buffer.

    cDitem-list-findcA finds the current item list item and searches for the text
    in the original buffer. This is typically bound to a mouse or key stroke
    action.

    cDitem-list-closecA closes the item list buffer.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example works through the cDitem-listcA definition for the ME
    macros e.g. given that the ME macro definition is:

        define-macro macro-name


    Searching for cG`define-macro \([a-z-]+\)`cA and replacing with cG`Macro \1`cA
    will work most of the time. The space between cGdefine-macrocA and the name
    does not have to be a single space and the cCnamecA does not have to contain
    just lower case letters, so these search strings should be a flexible as
    possible, try

        "define-macro\s +\(\w+\)"


    This however is not as optimal as it could be and if you have large files
    this could become slow. Performance can be greatly increased if it can be
    anchored to the start of the line, e.g.

        "^define-macro\s +\(\w+\)"


    but to allow for initial white spaces and the optional numeric argument,
    you really need

        "^\s *[0-9]*\s *define-macro\s +\(\w+\)"


    To hilight the function name you need the name encased the name in a magic
    hilighting string,

        "\ecBmacro-name\ecA"


    where cG\ecA is an escape char, so the replace string should be

        "Macro \ecB\1\ecA"


    Now all thats needed is to set these variables as fhook command variables,
    for macro files, the file hook command is cGfhook-emfcA, therefore the
    following is required:

sB
          set-variable .fhook-emf.item-list-s1 "^\\s *[0-9]*\\s *define-macro\\s +\\(\\w+\\)"
          set-variable .fhook-emf.item-list-r1 "Macro \ecB\\1\ecA"

sA
    Note that you can have as many of these search and replace variables as
    you require, i.e. cG.item-list-s1cA, cG.item-list-s2cA, cG.item-list-s3cA, ... ; but
    the more you have the slower it will be, often a good regex can do the job
    of 2 or 3.

    cDcomment-startcA  
    cDcomment-endcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The action of the cDcommentcA commands are file type specific (comments in cDCcA
    are cG/* ... to ... */cA where as MicroEmacs macro file comments are ; ... to
    the end of line) so the commands must be configured for each file type
    (see the NOTES section below). The configuration is automatically
    performed by almost all the standard file hooks released with MicroEmacs
    by the file hook so these commands should be fully functional.

    cDcomment-linecA comments out the current and next cCncA-1 lines (default when cCncA
    is omitted is to comment out just the current line). The cursor is then
    moved to the start of the next line. cDuncomment-linecA behaves differently
    depending on whether the file type terminates a comment with an end token
    or simply by the end of the line. If an end token is used then
    cDuncomment-linecA removes the current and next cCncA comments. If the end of line
    is used cDuncomment-linecA removes the first comment on the current and next
    cCn-1cA lines.

    cDcomment-to-end-of-linecA inserts cCcomment-padcAs (see NOTES) up-to the
    ls$buffer-fill-col(5)lm$buffer-fill-col(5)le and then terminates the comment with the comment-end
    string. cDcomment-restylecA reformats the text within the comment, filling
    text lines to the cD$buffer-fill-colcA and regenerating any boxing and divide
    lines.

    cDcomment-startcA opens a new "cD*comment*cA" buffer which is configured for
    writing a text comment, the user can then type in the comment with all the
    benefits of MicroEmacs in a plain text editor. Once the comment is
    complete use the cDcomment-endcA command to insert the comment into the source
    file, this comment is locally bounded to "cDC-c C-ccA". The styling of the
    comment is controlled by the cCcomment-flagcA setting (see NOTES).


cENOTES cA


    Consider the structure of a box comment to be as follows:

        <comment-start><comment-pad><comment-pad><comment-pad><comment-box-right>
        <comment-box-left> COMMENT TEXT ... COMMENT TEXT      <comment-box-right>
        <comment-box-left> COMMENT TEXT ... COMMENT TEXT      <comment-box-right>
        <comment-box-left><comment-pad><comment-pad><comment-pad><comment-end>


    The comment commands are configured by the single file hook command
    variable cD.fhook-cA_<type>cD_.commentcA where cC<type>cA is the file type label. The
    structure of the variable is a ls&ldel(4)lmlistle with the following format:

              |<comment-start>|<comment-end>|<comment-pad>|<comment-box-left>|...
                  ...<comment-box-right>|<comment-flags>|


    Where cG|cA is the list divide character. The cC<comment-flags>cA are a list of
    character flags which are defined as follows:

    cGbcA
    
       Box format required, i.e. create right edge using cC<comment-box-right>cA.

    cGfcA
    
       Footer line required.

    cGFcA
    
       Fill footer line with cC<comment-pad>cA strings.

    cGhcA
    
       Header line required.

    cGHcA
    
       Fill header line with cC<comment-pad>cA strings.

    cGjcA
    
       Enable Justify mode in *comment* buffer.

    cGrcA
    
       A restyle key binding is added to the buffer cG`esc o`cA and cG`esc q`cA
       buffer key bindings are added and bound to lscomment-restyle(3)lmcomment-restyle(3)le.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following cDcommentcA is the standard cDCcA setting:

sB
          set-variable .fhook-c.comment "|/*| */|*| * | * |f|"

sA
    This can be used to create comments of the form:

           /* comment-line comments out the current and next n-1 lines (default
           * when n is omitted is to comment out just the current line). The
           * cursor is then moved to the start of the next line.
           *
           * uncomment-line behaves differently depending on whether the file
           * type terminates a comment with an end token or simply by the end
           * of the line.
           */


    A box style comment can be generated by changing the cC<comment-flags>cA form
    cGfcA to cGbfFhHcA, producing:

          /*********************************************************************
           * comment-line comments out the current and next n-1 lines (default *
           * when n is omitted is to comment out just the current line). The   *

    display-matching-fence - Display the matching bracket
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDdisplay-matching-fencecA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDdisplay-matching-fencecA draws the fence (or bracket) pairing the one the
    cursor is currently over. A fence is considered to be one of the
    following:

        {...}   (...)   [...]


    If the matching fence is currently being drawn (i.e. it is visible) both
    fences are drawn in the 'cCNormalcA' Matching Fence scheme (see
    lsscheme-editor(3)lmscheme-editor(3)le). If the matching fence is not currently visible the
    cursor is temporarily moved to the matching fence for ls$pause-time(5)lm$pause-time(5)le
    milliseconds before returning to the starting position, the fences are
    hilighted using the Matching Fence 'Current' scheme. The matching fence
    delay can be interrupted by pressing any key. If the fence cannot be
    matched the fence is hilighted using the 'Select' scheme which is usually
    a bold red color.

    The numeric argument cDncA passed to the command is a bitwise flag where each
    bit is defined as follows:

    cD0x01cA
    
       Display fence (if not set nothing is done).

    cD0x02cA
    
       Use set-position id cCcG\x85cAcA instead of cCcG\x84cAcA (for internal use).

    cD0x04cA
    
       Don't Jump when matching fence is off screen.

    cD0x08cA
    
       Jump when closing a fence and its pair is off screen (for internal
       use).

    cD0x10cA
    
       Always jump to matching fence when closing a fence (for internal use).

    cD0x20cA
    
       Give preference to closing fence to left of cursor rather than
       character under the cursor (for internal use).

    cDexpand-look-backcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDexpand-look-backcA attempts to complete the word at the current position by
    looking backward for another word which starts the same. If such a word is
    found within 100 lines of the current cursor position the current partial
    word is replaced with the word found.

    cDexpand-look-backcA is automatically invoked from the lsexpand-abbrev-handle(3)lmexpand-abbrev-handle(3)le
    macro in response to an expansion command, it is only invoked if enabled

    enabled.


cENOTES cA


    cDexpand-look-backcA is a macro implemented in cGabbrev.emfcA.

    The cDuser-setupcA configuration simply sets the macro variable
    cG.expand-look-back.oncA to TRUE, i.e.:

    inserts it at the current cursor column on all the lines between the
    cursor and the mark inclusive. This is generally used to pre-pend lines
    with new text.

    cDspace-rectanglecA is the same as cDstring-rectanglecA except it inserts cCncA

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDbuff-initcA commands prepare the operating modes of a buffer for a
    language template. These commands operate with variables defined in the
    template and automatically configure MicroEmacs to use the template.

    The commands are used in the hook files (hkXXX.emf - see lsfileHooks(2)lmFile Hooksle) and
    simply the setting up of lslanguageTemplates(2)lmFile Language Templatesle by automating common
    actions and integrating the configuration settings made via
    lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le.

    The hook file is declared from cGme.emfcA or the user start up file binding a
    file extension or magic string association with the hook file. i.e.

sB
              -1 add-file-hook "-[*!]-[ \t]*XXX.*-[*!]-"    fhook-XXX
               1 add-file-hook "^#!/.*XXX"                  fhook-XXX

sA
    On loading a file which matches the lsadd-file-hook(2)lmadd-file-hook(2)le definition then the
    cGhkXXX.emfcA file is executed and the template is applied to the file.

    A basic template framework to be used with the cDbuff-initcA commands may be
    defined as follows for a language template called cCXXXcA:-

sB
          ; File hook - initialize buffer on loading the file.
          define-macro fhook-XXX
              set-variable $buffer-mask "luh1"

sA
    cDbuffer-initcA is invoked from the buffer file hook lsfileHooks(2)lmfhookle and is invoked with
    the numerical argument passed to the cCfhookcA macro (specified as cG$#cA). The
    call takes two arguments, the first is the cCnamecA of the template or hook,
    in the example this is cCXXXcA. The second argument is the cCetfcA template name
    (see lsetf(8)lmetf(8)le). The command initializes the buffer, using the cC.fhook-XXXcA
    variable information defined in the file.

    cDbuffer-init-hookscA is invoked from the buffer file hook lsfileHooks(2)lmfhookle typically
    following the cDbuffer-initcA call this macro invokes any user defined file
    hooks of the form cDmy-fhook-XXXcA. User defined cDmy-bhook-XXXcA and cDmy-ehook-XXXcA
    are configured into the buffer space ready for execution.

    cDbuffer-init-hookscA must be placed in all cDfhook-XXXcA macros to correctly
    initialize the file hooks. If this is not added then the cGcGmy-*hook-alwayscAcA
    macros may not be called correctly for buffers where the cDfhook-XXXcA has not
    been configured correctly.

    cDbuffer-init-fhookcA is placed at the end of the hook file definition and
    retrieves additional configuration information from the registry and the
    user settings, it will also locate and load any user additions to the
    template by loading the file cGmyXXX.emfcA.

    A set of global default file hooks may be defined of the form
    cDmy-fhook-alwayscA, cDmy-bhook-alwayscA, cDmy-ehook-alwayscA and cDmy-dhook-alwayscA.
    These file hooks are global and invoked after the


cEExecution Sequence  cA


    It is important to understand the execution sequence of the buffer hook
    files. On identifying a new file hook then the cGhkXXX.emfcA file is fetched
    from the file system and executed. Execution causes all of the variables
    to be defined and finally, when all definitions have been made,
    cDbuffer-init-fhookcA is executed to load in any user defined extensions. At
    this point then the macro cDfhook-XXXcA has ONLY been defined it has NOT been
    executed. This load operation is performed once only and is on demand.

    The cDfhook-XXXcA macro must be defined BEFORE any of the variables associated
    with the hook as all subsequent variables are command variables and are
    defined in the context of the macro definition. See lsVariables(4)lmVariables(4)le for more
    information on macro variables.

    cDfhook-XXXcA is invoked to apply hilighting, buffer key bindings, indentation
    etc. to a new buffer which has just been created.

    cDehook-XXXcA is invoked when a buffer is swapped out. This may be used to
    save global variables that have been modified in the context of the
    buffer.

    cDbhook-XXXcA is invoked when a buffer is swapped in. This may be used to
    restore variables that are specific to a buffer to global variables.

    cDdhook-XXXcA is invoked before a buffer is deleted. This may be used to clean
    up a buffer before it is destroyed.

    cDExtended file hookscA
    The buffer hooks cG[fbed]hook-XXXcA may be extended by user specific
    configuration in the form cGmy-[fbed]hook-anycA, these are invoked after the
    primary hook as been invoked and operate on all buffers rather than a
    specific buffer type. The cCmy-*hook-alwayscA mechanism is provided by the
    cCbuffer-initcA macros of cGbuffinit.emfcA rather than from the base command set
    of MicroEmacs.


cEConfiguration Masks  cA


    Buffer initialization is controlled by the settings of the variables
    cD.fhook-XXX.setupcA and cDfhook-XXX.setup-maskcA:-

sB
          set-variable .fhook-XXX.setup &reg "/history/fhook/XXX" "bdfghnopx"
          set-variable .fhook-XXX.setup-mask "abdefghikmnoptux"

sA
    The variables use an ASCII configuration string that identifies the modes
    of operation that are required. Upper and lower case alternatives are
    presented, an uppercase flag disables the mode, lower case enables. Where
    the flag is not specified then the mode is not changed.

    cGacA - Auto mode
    
       Configure lsauto(2m)lmauto(2m)le mode for automatic source file line type detection.
       Typically enabled for text files.

    cGbcA - Abbreviation mode
    
       Configures the abbreviation mode using lsbuffer-abbrev-file(2)lmbuffer-abbrev-file(2)le for the
       buffer.

    cGccA - View / Author mode
    
       Configure lsview(2m)lmview(2m)le mode for read only or authoring.

    cGdcA - Auto indentation operation.
    
       Automatic indent is enabled using lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le.

       Where lsindent(2m)lmindent(2m)le mode is required then omit the cGdcA flag and use flag cGicA
       instead.

    cGecA - Exact or case sensitivity operation
    
       Configure lsexact(2m)lmexact(2m)le case sensitive mode. cGecA enable exact, cGEcA disable
       exact.

    cGfcA - Folding/Collapsing operation
    
       Configures folding support, if enabled then the variables
       cC.fhook-XXX.collapse-OPERATIONcA, should be defined to declare the
       folding points.

    cGgcA - Fence matching operation
    
       Configure fence matching mode with lsfence(2m)lmfence(2m)le. Note that fence matching
       is now typically performed in the macro environment using
       lsdisplay-matching-fence(3)lmdisplay-matching-fence(3)le rather than the in-built fence matching.
       This colorizes the fences that are matched. cGgcA enable fence matching, cGGcA
       disable fence matching.

    cGhcA - Hilighting
    
       Support syntax hilighting, when defined then the hilighting scheme
       defined by cC.hilight.XXXcA is attached to the buffer.

    cGicA - Automatic indentation
    
       Support indentation using lsindent(2m)lmindent(2m)le. Automatic indentation (see
       lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le) is defined with the d flag. i enables indent, I disables
       indent.

    cGjcA - Justify
    
       Configure paragraph justification using lsjustify(2m)lmjustify(2m)le. cGjcA enable justify,
       cGJcA disable justify.

    cGkcA - Backup mode
    
       Configure backups with lsbackup(2m)lmbackup(2m)le mode. cGkcA enable backup, cGKcA disable
       backup.

    cGmcA - Magic mode
    
       Configure regular expression lsmagic(2m)lmmagic(2m)le mode. cGmcA enable magic, cGMcA disable
       magic.

    cGncA - New buffer header
    
       Enable the insertion of a buffer header from the lsetf(8)lmetf(8)le template file.

    cGocA - Tool menu
    
       Enable the tool menu for the buffer.

    cGpcA - Help page
    
       Produce a help page for the buffer describing the bindings.

    cGscA - Auto spell
    
       Configure automatic spelling for the buffer using lsauto-spell(3)lmauto-spell(3)le.

    cGtcA - Tab mode
    
       Configure insertion of literal tabs by enabling lstab(2m)lmtab(2m)le mode. cGtcA enable
       tab, cGTcA disable tab.

    cGucA - Undo
    
       Configure the undo/redo history using lsundo(2m)lmundo(2m)le mode. cGucA enable undo, cGUcA
       disable undo.

    cGwcA - Wrap
    
       Configure wrapping using lswrap(2m)lmwrap(2m)le mode. cGwcA enable wrap, cGWcA disable wrap.

    cGxcA - Time stamping
    
       Configure time stamping as defined by lstime(2m)lmtime(2m)le.

    cG1cA - Reformatting hilighting
    
       A special internal flag indicating that hilighting is used for
       reformatting purposes, i.e. to make readable and hide control text.

    cG#cA - Commenting
    
       Special flag used to indicate commenting is supported. The comment
       format should be defined with the cC.fhook-XXX.commentcA variable within
       the template.

    cD.fhook-XXX.setupcA is the current set-up, this is normally defined to take
    settings from the registry providing a default when not defined. This is
    the only mask that is allowed to include the uppercase flags. All values
    defined in cD.fhook-XXX.setupcA are explicitly enabled or disabled by default.
    The setup set should contain the configuration flags that are required to
    make the template operate correctly, but should not include modes that the
    user may set up i.e. cCexactcA or cCmagiccA etc.

    cD.fhook-XXX.setup-maskcA defines the set of flags that are allowed with the
    template. The configuration defined in lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le is tested against
    the mask, if the mask allows it then the mode is enabled. cD.fhook-XXX.setupcA
    is generally a subset of cD.fhook-XXX.setup-maskcA.

    lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le operates with the values defined by .fhook-XXX.setup and
    cD.fhook-XXX.setup-maskcA. The initialization of cD.fhook-XXX.setupcA is performed
    using the registry as follows:-

sB
          set-variable .fhook-XXX.setup &reg "/history/fhook/XXX" "bdfghnopx"

sA
    This allows the user to configure over-ridding modes via lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le.
    The user configuration is saved to the lsRegistrylmRegistryle and restored using
    ls&reg(4)lm&reg(4)le, when the variable is defined. The flags that are defined by
    lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le include a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, m, n, o, p, s, t,
    cGucA, cGwcA, and cGxcA.


cETags  cA


    The buffer setup may be configured to add a tags generator to the language
    template, this is added to the menu. The tags generation is declared in
    the template by assigning the variable cD.fhook-XXX.tagscA with a command line
    to run tags utility. The command line string should commence with a cG!cA
    character to tell MicroEmacs to execute an external command, for example
    to use the GNU cDctags(2)cA utility is defined as:-

sB
          set-variable .fhook-c.tags "!ctags *.c *.h"

sA
    When the value starts with a cCcG!cAcA then rest of the line is spawned as a
    process, no additional interface is provided to the command.

    Some language templates include a macro cCtagscA facility to generate a tags
    file (See lsemftags(3f)lmemftags(3f)le - cGemftags.emfcA, lsctags(3f)lmctags(3f)le - cGctags.emfcA, lsntags(3f)lmntags(3f)le -
    cGntags.emfcA). cD.fhook-XXX.tagscA may be defined to use an internal macro based
    tags generator rather than an external command. Without the cCcG!cAcA character
    the command line is assumed to be an MicroEmacs macro based and runs the
    command

         me @<.tags-var-value> -v%tag-options=<options>


    A macros based command line for the 'C' Programming Language is defined
    as:-

sB
          set-variable .fhook-c.tags "ctags"

sA
    The presence of a tags generator is not flagged in the setup flags,
    declaration of the cD.fhook-XXX.tagscA variable is sufficient to declare that
    a tags generator exists.


cEPrivate Configuration Extensions  cA


    The cD.fhook-XXX.setupcA may be extended to include local configuration items
    that are private to a specific buffer. The extensions are added to the
    lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le menu and provide an on/off check-box control to enable and
    disable specific buffer features. Feature examples include: Enable or
    disable Doxygen highlighting in a buffer, control hidden file names in a
    directory listing etc.

    The configuration extensions are defined using two additional hook
    variables, these variables are normally omitted and only defined if the
    extensions are required.

    cD.fhook-XXX.setup-flagscA
    
       Defines the alphabetic [cGa-zcA] setup characters that are used to enable
       or disable a feature. These are defined as MicroEmacs list variables
       (see ls&lfind(4)lm&lfind(4)le, ls&lget(4)lm&lget(4)le, etc. for the full syntax definition). The
       characters that may be used are those that are not used by buffer
       setup i.e. cGcGclqrvyzcAcA

    cD.fhook-XXX.setup-labelscA
    
       Defines the text labels that are added to the setup menu, the label is
       associated with the enable button.

    To add a new feature switch then the the character flags to hold the state
    are are defined with the cD.fhook-XXX.setup-flagscA and
    cD.fhook-XXX.setup-labelscA. The characters defined with the cDsetup-flagscA
    should be added to cD.fhook-XXX.setup-maskcA. If the option is to be enabled
    by default then the enabling character is added to cD.fhook-XXX.setupcA.

    To enable/disable the features then lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le when invoked modifies
    the state of the variable cD.fhook-XXX.setupcA and then executes the buffer
    hook again causing the new state to be processed and applied. The modified
    cD.fhook-XXX.setupcA value is stored in the user registry and is applied
    thereafter when the specified buffer type is loaded.

    Within the template definition then the additional flags are checked by
    testing the state of the cD.fhook-XXX.setupcA variable. An example is shown
    below.

sB
          ; Add the extra variable to the buffer-init variables
          ; Option 1 is disabled and Option 2 is enabled by default here.
          set-variable .fhook-XXX.setup &reg "/history/fhook/XXX" "bdfghnopxl"
          set-variable .fhook-XXX.setup-mask "abdefghikmnoptuxcl"

          ; Define the additional options.
          set-variable .fhook-XXX.setup-flags   "|c|l|"
          set-variable .fhook-XXX.setup-labels  "|Option 1|Option 2|"

          ; Test for the Option 1 being enabled.
          !if &sin "c" .fhook-XXX.setup
              ; Do Option 1 configuration.
          !endif

          ; Test for the Option 2 being enabled.
          !if &sin "l" .fhook-XXX.setup
              ; Do Option 2 configuration.
          !endif

sA
    The templates cGhkc.emfcA, cGhkcpp.emfcA and cGhkjava.emfcA include private extensions
    which may be used as examples.


cEComments  cA


    The format of comments may be defined in the template using the
    cD.fhook-XXX.commentcA variable. Definition of the comment form allows the
    comment formatting to be automatically set up. Where the comment format is
    defined then the following key bindings are automatically added to the
    template:-

       cGC-c C-scA cDcomment-startcA - start a new comment.  
       cGC-c C-ccA cDcomment-linecA - comment out the current line.  
       cGC-c C-dcA cDuncomment-linecA - remove commenting from current line.  
       cGC-c C-ecA cDcomment-to-end-of-linecA - comment to end of line.  
       cGC-c C-rcA cDcomment-restylecA - format/re-style comment.  

    Help information is automatically added to the buffer to describe the key
    bindings if help information is enabled.

    The default comment format is defined with the variable cD.fhook-XXX.commentcA
    with an argument string in the form "cD|cA cC<comment-start>cA cD|cA cC<comment-end>cA cD|cA
    cC<comment-pad>cA cD|cA cC<mid-box-left>cA cD|cA cC<mid-box-right>cA cD|cA cC<comment-flags>cA cD|cA".
    Where a language supports multiple comment types, or styles, then
    additional comment styles may be specified with a comment definition of
    the form cD.fhook-XXX.comment-NcA where cDNcA is an integer from cG1cA to cGncA. Each
    definition defines an different comment style. Additional comment
    definitions should be ordered such that the longest or most definitive
    comment definition appears before other comment definitions which have
    less definitive features. The comment matching searches each of the
    comment definitions in the order cG1cA to cGncA to determine the comment style, as
    soon as a positive match is located then the comment is used without
    searching the remaining comments.

    The fields of the comment definition are defined as follows:-

    cC<comment-start>cA
    
       The format of the start of the comment or comment open syntax.

    cC<comment-end>cA
    
       The format of the closing comment, where the comment exists to the end
       of the line then the field is defined as empty. Leading white space
       should be included where this affects the horizontal positioning of
       the comment, white leading space is ignored in any match i.e. cG` */`cA
       for C type comments.

    cC<comment-pad>cA
    
       The character to use to pad a comment between the cC<comment-start>cA and
       cC<comment-end>cA characters when creating a line or a box formation.

    cC<mid-box-left>cA
    
       The start of a comment continuation line when creating a box comment.

    cC<mid-box-right>cA
    
       The end of a comment continuation line when creating a box comment and
       the comment is not closed and continues on the next line.

    cC<comment-flags>cA
 
       The comment flags define how the comment should be formatted when
       re-styled. The flags are defined as single characters that describe
       the attributes. Re-styling may include the following attributes:-

       cDb cA  
              Box format required, create a left and right edge for the comment.

       cDf cA  
              A footer line is required, a new line is created following the
              comment text to contain the with a closing comment <comment-end>
              string. The end of comment is not padded.

       cDF cA  
              As f except the footer line is left padded with <comment-pad>
              strings.

       cDh cA  
              A header line is required, a new line is created before the
              comment text to contain the opening comment <comment-start>
              string. The end of comment is not padded.

       cDH cA  
              As h except the header line is right padded with <comment-pad>
              strings.

       cDj cA  
              Enable justification mode in the *comment* buffer and re-style.

       cDr cA  
              A restyle key binding is added to the buffer "esc o" and "esc q"
              buffer key bindings are added and bound to lscomment-restyle(3)lmcomment-restyle(3)le. The
              r flag is only processed from the

    Examples of the comments format are shown below.

cECommands and Key Bindings  cA


    Local buffer commands and key bindings for over-riding key definitions
    used within the buffer are defined with the cGfhook-XXX.command-*cA variables.
    These are defined as MicroEmacs list variables (see ls&lfind(4)lm&lfind(4)le, ls&lget(4)lm&lget(4)le,
    etc. for the full syntax definition) and define a list of keys, commands
    and bindings. Each command is typically separated by the cCcG|cAcA character.
    The field order in all of the cGfhook-XXX.command-*cA variables MUST be
    consistent, so if a command is defined in field 5, then all definitions
    associated with that command MUST be defined in field 5 for all variables.

    To make the command definitions easier then the syntax cGfhook-XXX.command-ncA
    may be used where cCncA is an integer from cC0..n-1cA. The cGfhook-XXX.command-ncA
    statements are used to construct the cGfhook-XXX.command-*cA lists, the
    advantage being that the command and key bindings etc. are defined
    together. Once the cGcommand-ncA variables are processed then they are deleted
    from the environment. The general syntax of the cGcommand-ncA variable is
    defined as a list:

        `|command-flag|command-nbind|command-name|command-kbind|command-desc|`

    The command variables are defined as follows:-

    cC.fhook-c.command-flagcA
    
       A configuration flag that defines the components to use for the
       command. The flags are set as individual characters and are defined as
       follows:-

       cGtcA - Toolbar
    
        Show the command in the toolbar. The .fhook-XXX.command-desc
         variable should contain a readable name for the command to display
         in the menu. An optional hot key for selection in any lsosd(2)lmosdle is
         specified by prefixing the character in the string with \H.

       cGhcA - Help Screen
     
        Show the command in the help screen. The .fhook-XXX.command-desc
         variable should contain a readable name for the command to display
         in the menu. An optional hot key for selection in any lsosd(2)lmosdle is
         specified by prefixing the character in the string with \H.

       cGbcA - Key binding

        Create a buffer key binding for the command, the key to bind is
         defined by the variable fhook-XXX.command-kbind, if the command
         requires a numerical argument then this is defined in the variable
         fhook-XXX.command-nbind. The binding is only created if the key
         buffer binding does not already exist, the binding may be forced
         by using the o flag. Where a key binding is only to be created if
         hilighting is enabled then the b flag should be qualified with the
         H flag.

       cGocA - Forced key binding

        Optionally used with the b and forces the binding to over-write
         any existing binding.

       cGicA - Emulated key binding
     
        Used with the b flag, ignores key bindings that are emulation
         mappings.

       cGHcA - Hilighting key binding
     
        Used with the b flag, only performs the key binding if hilighting
         is enabled.

    cC.fhook-XXX.command-namecA
    
       Specifies the name of the command to execute, this may be a built in
       command of a macro. Typically the command is a local macro defined in
       the hook file.

    cC.fhook-XXX.command-nbindcA
    
       The value of the numeric argument to pass to the command defined in
       the cC.fhook-XXX.command-namecA field. This field may be empty if no
       numeric argument is required.

    cC.fhook-XXX.command-kbindcA
    
       The local key binding to bind to the command, this field is only
       interpreted if the cGbcA is specified, otherwise the field may be empty.
       Where multiple key bindings are required to the same command then a
       field definition is required for each binding.

    cC.fhook-c.command-desccA
    
       A short description of the command that is used for the help page (cGhcA)
       and toolbar (cGtcA). The field may be empty if the field is not specified
       for insertion into the toolbar or help page.

    As an example, two new commands or bindings may be defined for a template,
    the first field is bound to key cGA-qcA which executes macro cGXXX-compcA with a
    numerical argument of 2. The second field binds a new key to
    lscomment-restyle(3)lmcomment-restyle(3)le.

          !emacro

sA
    The alternative form of definition using the cGcommand-ncA syntax is defined
    as:-

sB
          .....

          set-variable .fhook-XXX.command-0 "|th|2|XXX-comp|A-q|Complete command|"
          set-variable .fhook-XXX.command-1 "|bo||comment-restyle|esc o||"

          .....

          ; Local macro definition to perform command completion
          define-macro XXX-comp
              set-variable #l1 @#
              .....
          !emacro

sA
    The key bindings sometimes need to be protected where they have been
    redefined to perform some other operation for example when emulation modes
    are used (i.e. cDneditcA, cDme3.8cA). The buffer initialisation uses the command
    cDbuffer-bind-createcA and the variables cD.buffer-bind-create.map-fromcA and
    cD.buffer-bind-create.map-tocA which define replacement keys for bindings. As
    an example the cDneditcA emulation mode uses key binding cGC-c C-ccA and provides
    a buffer binding mapping to translate any key buffer binding to a
    different key. i.e.

sB
          ; reconfigure the buffer bindings
          set-variable .buffer-bind-key.map-from "|C-c C-c|C-c C-d|"
          set-variable .buffer-bind-key.map-to   "|C-b|C-u|"

cEInformation Hiding with Collapse  cA


    MicroEmacs 2009 provides a generic, albeit coarse, folding mechanism which
    is applied to some of the well known file modes. The folding mechanism
    allows parts of the buffer to be scrolled up and hidden, leaving a residue
    hilighting marker within the buffer indicating a folded region. A folded
    buffer typically allows a summary of the buffer contents to be viewed
    within several windows, hiding the detail of the buffer.

    Note: cDcollapsecA was called cDfoldcA in earlier releases but the name was
    changed when real fold editing support was added, see cGfold.emfcA for more
    information.

    The folding mechanism uses well defined cCstartcA and cCendcA markers which form
    part of the syntax of the well known file mode. i.e. in 'C' this is the
    open and closed braces that appear on the left-hand margin (cG{cA .. cG}cA). The
    intention is that the natural syntax of the text is used to determine the
    fold positions, requiring no additional text formating or special text
    tags to be inserted by the user.

    The language template defines the syntax of blocks of information that may
    be collapsed and hidden with lsnarrow-buffer(2)lmnarrowle. In order to utilize the
    lscollapse-current(3)lmcollapse-current(3)le and lscollapse-all(3)lmcollapse-all(3)le commands within a buffer, the
    cCstartcA and cCendcA markers have to be initialized for the syntactical contents
    of the buffer. The buffer specific variables are defined as follows, where
    cCXXXcA is the file hook base name. The cG.fhook-XXX.collapse-*cA variables define
    the regular expression search pattern and line positioning.

    cD.fhook-XXX-collapse-opencA
    
       A regular expression search string used to locate the start of the
       string. For speed the search string should include a regular
       expression start or end of line character whenever possible. i.e. in C
       the open is defined as cGcG^{cAcA.

    cD.fhook-XXX-collapse-closecA
    
       A regular expression search string used to locate the end of the
       string. For speed the search string should include a regular
       expression start or end line character whenever possible. i.e. in C
       the close is defined as cGcG^}cAcA.

    cD.fhook-XXX-collapse-mopencA
    
       An integer value that denotes the number of lines to move in a forward
       or (negative n) backward direction from the cCstartcA line located by the
       search string to the position in the buffer to be folded. If default
       value when cDmopencA is omitted is 0, starting the fold from the search
       string line.

    cD.fhook-XXX-collapse-mclosecA
    
       The relative displacement from the close fold line to the fold
       position, this is a positive or negative displacement depending on
       where the fold is to be positioned.

    cD.fhook-XXX-collapse-mnextcA
    
       Specifies the number of lines to advance before the next search is
       continued on the fold operation. This is only used by lscollapse-current(3)lmcollapse-allle.

    The following examples show how the collapse variables are set up in each
    of the buffer modes.

    cDC and C++cA
    
       cDCcA and cDC++cA collapse on the open and close brace appearing in the
       left-hand margin. The collapse variables are defined in cGhkccA/cGhkcpp.emfcA
       as follows:-

sB
              set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-open  "^{"
              set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-close "^}"
              set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-mopen  "-1"
              set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-mclose "1"
              set-variable .fhook-c.collapse-mnext "-1"

sA       Given a 'C' function definition:-

              static void
              myfunc (int a, int b)
              {
                  /* Function body */
              }


       the folded version appears as follows:-

              static void
              myfunc (int a, int b) ... }



    cDemfcA
    
       MicroEmacs macro files cDemfcA support folding of macro definitions, the
       collapse variables are defined in cGhkemf.emfcA as follows:-

sB
              set-variable .fhook-emf.collapse-open  "^0? ?define-macro[ \t]"
              set-variable .fhook-emf.collapse-close "^!emacro"
              set-variable .fhook-emf.collapse-mclose "1"
              set-variable .fhook-emf.collapse-mnext "-1"

sA
      Given a macro definition:-

sB
              0 define-macro mymacro
              ; This is the body of the macro
              ; ... and some more ...
              !emacro

sA
      the collapsed version of the macro is defined as:-

sB
              0 define-macro mymacro ... !emacro

sA
    cDnroffcA
    
       cDnroffcA is configured for manual pages only and folds between cG.SHcA and
       cG.SScA sections, the hook variables are defined as follows:-

sB
              set-variable .fhook-nroff.collapse-open  "^\.S[SH]"
              set-variable .fhook-nroff.collapse-close "^\.S[SH]\|\'"
              set-variable .fhook-nroff.collapse-mnext "-1"

sA      Given an nroff block of text defined as:-

              .SH SYNOPSIS
              .\" Some text
              .\" Some more text
              .SH DESCRIPTION


      Then the collapsed version appears as:

              .SH SYNOPSIS
              .SH DESCRIPTION


    cDtcl/tkcA
    
       cDtcl/tkcA is configured to collapse procedures. The collapse variables
       are defined as:-

sB
              set-variable .fhook-tcl.collapse-open  "^proc "
              set-variable .fhook-tcl.collapse-close "^}"
              set-variable .fhook-tcl.collapse-mclose "1"
              set-variable .fhook-tcl.collapse-mnext "-1"

sA
      Given a tcl procedure definition:-

              proc tixControl:InitWidgetRec {w} {
                  upvar #0 $w data

                  tixChainMethod $w InitWidgetRec

                  set data(varInited)   0
                  set data(serial) 0
              }


      The collapsed version of the same section appears as:-

              proc tixControl:InitWidgetRec {w} { ... }


    Where folding is required using lsfold-open(3)lmfold-open(3)le then the collapse methods
    above are not enacted when folding is enabled. Folding may be enabled as
    defined by the lsfileHooks(2)lmFile Hooksle, alternatively the folding may be explicitly
    defined using the variable cC.fhook-XXX.foldcA. The cC.fhook-XXX.foldcA variable
    argument is defined as "cD|cA cC<literal-open>cA cD|cA cC<literal-close>cA cD|cA
    cC<comment-termination>cA cD|cA cC<regex-find-open>cA cD|cA cC<regex-find-close>cA cD|cA." Where
    the fields are defined as follows:-

    cC<literal-open>cA
    
       The literal fold open string.

    cC<literal-close>cA
    
       The literal fold close string.

    cC<comment-termination>cA
    
       The comment termination string.

    cC<regex-find-open>cA
    
       The regular expression to find an open fold.

    cC<regex-find-close>cA
    
       The regular expression to find a close string.

      As an example, a language may have the following syntax for defining
      folds:-

        /* {{{ This is an example fold. */
        This is
        the body
        of the fold
        /* }}} */


      The fold is defined as follows:-

sB
          set-variable fhook-XXX.fold "|/\\* {{{|/\\* }}}|\\*/|/\\*[ \t]*{{{|/\\*[ \t]*}}}|"

sA
cEItem Lists  cA


    lsitem-list(3)lmItem Listsle perform a regular expression search of a buffer, presenting a
    list of the located text and associated types in a separate window which
    is presented to the left of the buffer window or more typically in the
    toolbar. The command lsitem-list(3)lmitem-list(3)le is a generic command that interacts with
    the buffer environment variables to present abbreviated buffer information
    to the user.

    The regular expression search strings are predefined in the language
    templates, using the variables cD.fhook-XXX-item-list-sYcA and
    cD.fhook-XXX-item-list-rYcA and are described more fully in lsitem-list(3)lmitem-list(3)le.


cEHilighting  cA


    Buffer hilighting is defined by the lshilight(2)lmhilight(2)le command. Within the context
    of cDbuffer-initcA then the standard definitions and name space conventions
    should be adhered to:-

sB
          !if &not &exist .hilight.XXX
              set-variable .hilight.XXX &pinc .hilight.next 1
          !endif
          !if &and &sin "h" .fhook-XXX.setup &band .hilight.flags 0x02
              ; High-light XXX Mode
              0 hilight    .hilight.XXX 0                    $global-scheme
              .....
              ; Variable hilighting
              !if &band .hilight.flags 0x08
                  ; hilight constants, e.g. numbers
                  hilight .hilight.XXX 1 "[[:digit:]]+"       .scheme.constant
                  ......
              !endif
          !endif

sA
cEIndentation  cA


    Buffer indentation is defined by the lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le command. Within the context
    of cDbuffer-initcA then the standard definitions and name space conventions
    should be adhered to. The buffer indentation scheme uses the hilighting
    variable, if hilighting is not defined then the variable allocation of
    cG.hilight.XXXcA should be performed as defined in the previous Hilighting
    section.

sB
          !if &sin "d" .fhook-XXX.setup
              0 indent  .hilight.XXX 0 10
              indent .hilight.XXX n "{"  4
              indent .hilight.XXX o "}" -4
              .....
          !endif

sA
cEHISTORY cA


    The January 2005 version of MicroEmacs introduced the following changes:

    - The cGmy-*hook-alwayscA introduced allowing global file hooks to
          manipulate operate on any buffer.
    - The Electric-C indentation previously flagged as cG>cA was removed, as
          was cmode(2m). Indentation configuration for C mode is now performed
          by the lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le command.
    - Private template configuration using cD.fhook-XXX.setup-flagscA and
          .fhook-XXX.setup-labels.
    - The cGfhook-XXX.command-ncA syntax was introduced in June 2005 to
          simplify the command list definitions.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDpage-filecA commands allow large files, up to 2GB in size, to be viewed
    and edited. cDpage-filecA operates by loading a small part (or cCpagecA) of the
    file into a buffer for viewing and editing hence the whole file is not
    loaded into memory. The file may be viewed and edited while in a page
    mode, MicroEmacs automatically manages the page swapping and updates to
    the file.

    While a file is being paged then a replacement set of commands are used to
    navigate through the buffer. These replacement commands automatically load
    the next page into the buffer, discarding or saving any edits from
    existing pages.


cEFile Loading  cA


    cDpage-filecA finds the named file cCfile-namecA. If it is already in a buffer,
    make that buffer active in the current window, otherwise attempt to create
    a new paged buffer and read the file into it. Syntax hilighting is
    available following any file loading. cDpage-filecA is the paged equivalent of
    lsfind-file(2)lmfind-file(2)le.

    The numeric argument cCncA is used to modify the default behavior of the
    command, where the bits are defined as follows:

    cD0x01cA
    
       If the file does not exist and this bit is not set the command fails
       at this point.

    cD0x02cA
    
       If this bit is set the file will be loaded with lsbinary(2m)lmbinary(2m)le mode
       enabled. See help on cDbinarycA mode for more information on editing
       binary data files.

    cDpage-bfilecA loads a file as binary data, providing binary editing
    capabilities. The command operate as command lspage-file(3)lmpage-file(3)le except that it
    loads the given file with lsbinary(2m)lmbinary(2m)le mode set.


cESaving  cA


    cDpage-file-save-buffercA saves the contents of the current buffer if the
    contents have been changed, writing the buffer back to the file it was
    read from. This command is the same as lssave-buffer(2)lmsave-buffer(2)le for a paged file.


cENavigation  cA


    cDpage-file-beginning-of-buffercA moves to the beginning of the buffer. If any
    edits have been performed at the current viewing position that need to be
    saved then the user is prompted to save the changes and the new pages are
    loaded from the file at the beginning of the buffer.

    cDpage-file-end-of-buffercA moves to the end of the buffer in a similar way to
    cDpage-file-beginning-of-buffercA.

    cDpage-file-goto-bytecA advances the buffer to the byte offset specified by
    cCbyte-offsetcA. If any edits have been performed at the current viewing
    position that need to be saved then the user is prompted to save the
    changes and the new pages are loaded from the file at the specified file
    byte offset.

    cDpage-file-goto-pagecA advances the buffer to the page offset specified by
    cCbyte-offsetcA. The behavior is the same as cDpage-file-goto-bytecA.

    cDpage-file-scroll-upcA and cDpage-file-scroll-downcA moves the window in the
    current buffer down by cCncA lines, the default when cCncA is omitted is 1 windows
    worth of lines i.e. a next page operation. The user is prompted to save
    changes if a file paging operation is performed.

    cDpage-file-forward-linecA moves the cursor down cCncA lines, default 1. If the
    line is not on the current screen then display the next page and move to
    the line. Similarly cDpage-file-backward-linecA moves the cursor up cCncA lines,
    if the line is not on the current screen then display the previous page
    and move to the line. The user is prompted to save changes if a file
    paging operation is performed.


cESearching  cA


    cDpage-file-searching-buffercA is designed to be called from a macro and
    searches for a string in the buffer. The cCoptioncA specifies the search
    direction.

    cDpage-file-search-forwardcA and cDpage-file-search-backwardcA searches for a
    string from the current cursor position to the end/start of the file and
    is simular to lssearch-forward(2)lmsearch-forward(2)le and lssearch-backward(2)lmsearch-backward(2)le, respectively. If
    the search string is not found in the current buffer then the search
    continues by paging the file until the start/end of the file is reached.
    The user is prompted to save changes if a file paging operation is
    performed.

    cDpage-file-isearch-forwardcA and cDpage-file-isearch-backwardcA perform and
    incremental forward and backward search in the paged file and are similar
    to lsisearch-forward(2)lmisearch-forward(2)le and lsisearch-backward(2)lmisearch-backward(2)le, respectively. If the search
    string is not found in the current buffer then the search continues by
    paging the file until the start/end of the file is reached. The user is
    prompted to page and save changes if a file paging operation is performed.


cENOTES cA


    The cDpage-filecA macros are implemented in macro file cGpagefile.emfcA. The
    paging is managed in macro space and uses lsinsert-file(2)lminsert-file(2)le to perform the
    read.

    cCncA cDtoolbarcA  
    cDtoolbar-opencA  
    cDtoolbar-closecA  
    cDtoolbar-refreshcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The toolbar is one or more fixed buffers that typically appear at the
    left-hand edge of the window that contains different tools that assist in
    editing the buffer. The toolbar is really a container for tools and short
    cuts which are configured by the user depending on the tool that has been
    loaded. The tools themselves are buffer context sensitive, the
    lsbuffer-init(3)lmbuffer-init(3)le command automatically re-configures the toolbar for the
    buffer at run time.

    The configuration of the toolbar is stored in command variables cG.toolvar.*cA
    which are used to control the toolbar. The tools that are available in
    toolbar are determined from the file cGtoollist.emfcA which is loaded when the
    toolbar is started. User defined toolbars may be added by redefinging the
    toolbar variables at runtime.

    cDtoolbarcA toggles the visibility of the toolbar, i.e. if the toolbar is open
    it is closed and vica versa. If the numeric argument cCncA is specified then
    zero closes the toolbar and non-zero opens the toolbar. cDtoolbar-opencA
    initializes and starts the toolbar if it is not already running. The
    toolbar is loaded and instantiated in the system. The toolbar may be
    subsequently closed using cDtoolbar-closecA. Whilst the toolbar is running
    then the content of the tollbar may become out of date, the command
    lstoolbar-refresh(3)lmtoolbar-refresh(3)le forces the toolbar to be re-evaluated and the content
    is updated.


cECONFIGURATION cA


    The toolbar is configured with command variables cD.toolbar.*cA. The size
    information of the toolbar is defined with the following variables:-

    cC.toolbar.widthcA
    
       Defines the default width of the left-hand vertical toolbar.

    cC.toolbar.depthcA
    
       Defines the default depth of the top horizontal toolbar.

    The tools within the toolbar are configured with the following variables.
    Each variable is divided into fields, each field represents a single tool.
    The fields are separated with the cG\CHcA character. The order of the fields
    MUST be the same in each of the variables such that the field content
    matches the tool that is being defined.

    cC.tool-flagcA
    
    The cD.tool-flagcA variable describes the behaviour of the tool, this is
    defined as a bitmask as follows:-

       cG0x000001cA - Update on creation
    
         Call the tool update command when the tool is created, this is

          performed.

       cG0x000004cA - Buffer type changed
    
         Call the tool update command when the buffer type has changed, a
          change of buffer type requires that a buffer specific tool is
          reconfigured.

       cG0x000008cA - Current buffer changed
 
         Call the tool update command when the current buffer is changed, a
          change of buffer buffer requires that a buffer content specific
          tool is reconfigured.

       cG0x000010cA - Current buffer modified or saved

         Call the tool update command when the current buffer is modified
          or saved.

       cG0x000080cA - Perform update checks

         On an update check the toolbar for changes in content.

      cG0x000100cA - Lock depth and width
      
         Lock the depth and width of the tool.

       cG0x000200cA - Tool uses a paged window

         The tool uses a paged window in the toolbar (i.e. only one tool
          has focus).

       cG0x000400cA - Tool is hidden

         The tool is currently hidden. When in this state the not active

        cG0x001000cA - position in the left toolbar

         The tool is present in the left toolbar, on toolbar creation the
          tool is automatically loaded into the toolbar.

       cG0x002000cA - position in the top toolbar

         The tool is present in the top toolbar, on toolbar creation the
          tool is automatically loaded into the toolbar.

       cG0x004000cA - position in the right toolbar

    cDyank-rectangle-overwritecA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDcopy-rectanglecA copies a rectangle (or column) of text defined between the
    cursor and the lsset-mark(2)lmset-markle position. The text between the mark column and the
    cursor column is copied from every line between the mark line and the
    cursor line inclusive and copied to the kill buffer. The copied text may
    then be extracted from the kill buffer using lsyank(2)lmyank(2)le, lsyank-rectangle(2)lmyank-rectangle(2)le or
    cDyank-rectangle-overwritecA.

    The mark position may be ahead or behind the current cursor position. If
    the rectangle column boundary divides a tab character which spans multiple
    columns, the tab character is replaced with the equivalent number of
    spaces. Similarly if the boundary divides an unprintable character which
    is displayed using multiple characters (e.g. cCcG^AcAcA for character 0x01) then
    spaces are inserted before the character to move it to the right of the
    boundary.

    cDyank-rectangle-overwritecA replaces a column of text with the current kill
    buffer, overwriting existing text with the contents of the kill buffer.
    The kill buffer should contain a rectangle region acquired with
    cDcopy-rectanglecA or lskill-rectangle(2)lmkill-rectangle(2)le. The current cursor position
    identifies the top left of the column to be written, the width of the
    column to be replaced is determined by the width of the kill buffer text
    being inserted.

cEINTRODUCTION cA


    MicroEmacs supports folding editor type features that allow folds to be
    created, deleted and traversed. Folded regions of the file may be entered
    and edited whilst hiding information in other folds. Folds may also be
    opened in-line such that more than one fold is visible at any time.

    The cDfoldcA operation has different semantics than lscollapse-current(3)lmcollapsele which simply
    hides information with a single narrow and does not provide features such
    as entering the fold.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDfold-createcA creates a new fold from the text defined between the cursor
    and the lsset-mark(2)lmset-markle position. The text between the mark line and the cursor
    line inclusive are then folded and fold markers are inserted into the
    buffer. The folded line may be commented with a fold comment. The fold may
    be subsequently removed with cDfold-removecA which removes the fold under the
    cursor, deleting any fold annotations.

    cDfold-opencA opens the fold under the cursor, the fold is expanded in line
    such that the contents of the fold are visible. The fold may be
    subsequently closed using cDfold-closecA when the body of the text is hidden
    underneath a fold marker.

    cDfold-entercA enters a fold under the cursor and the contents of the fold are
    reveled the rest of the buffer is narrowed out. The previous fold level
    may be restored with cDfold-exitcA. Where the fold nesting is deep then
    cDfold-exit-allcA may be used to return to the top level.

    cDfold-killcA deletes the fold under the cursor and all of the information
    contained within the fold. lsundo(2)lmundo(2)le will restore the fold if this was not
    the required action.


cEDEFINITION cA


    Any file may be folded provided that the opening and closing fold strings
    are defined. Folding may be defined and initialized for a file type using
    lsbuffer-init(3)lmbuffer-init(3)le by defining the fhopok-XXX.fold variable to define the
    opening and closing fold markers. i.e.

sB
          set-variable .fhook-XXX.fold "<open> <close>"

sA
    Where cC<open>cA and cC<close>cA are the opening and closing fold strings.

    Folding may also be introduced on a file basis by defining the sold
    markers in the magic string by assignment of the open and close fold
    strings through the variables cDfold-open:cA and cDfold-close:cA. The macro file
    cGfold.emfcA does this to fold a MicroEmacs macro file as follows:-

sB
          ; -!- emf: fold-open: ";OPEN" ; fold-close: ";CLOSE" ; -!-

          ;OPEN fold-idle
          0 define-macro fold-idle

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDnarrow-search-forwardcA "cCstringcA" (cDC-c scA)  
    cCncA cDnarrow-search-backwardcA "cCstringcA" (cDC-c rcA)


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDnarrow-search-forwardcA searches for a string from the current cursor
    position to the end of the file and will open up and search through
    lsnarrow(2m)lmnarrow(2m)le regions to search for the string. This differs from the
    lssearch-forward(2)lmsearch-forward(2)le command that does not search through narrow regions.

    The string is typed on the bottom line of the screen, and terminated with
    the cG<ESC>cA key. Special characters can be typed in by preceding them with a
    cG^QcA. A single cG^QcA indicates a null string. On successive searches, hitting
    cG<ESC>cA alone causes the last search string to be reused.

    Searching is affected by lsmagic(2m)lmmagic(2m)le mode, which allows regular expression
    pattern matching, and lsexact(2m)lmexact(2m)le mode which makes the search case
    sensitive.

    The numeric argument cCncA is interpreted as follows:-

    cDn > 0cA
    
       The cCncAth occurrence of the cCstringcA is located.

    cDn < 0cA
    
       The first occurrence of the cCstringcA is located in the next cCncA lines.

    cDnarrow-search-backwardcA searches backwards in the file. In all other ways
    it is like cDnarrow-search-forwardcA.


cEDIAGNOSTICS cA


    The command returns a status of cGFALSEcA if the cCstringcA could not be located
    (or cCncAth cCstringcA where cCncA occurrences are requested). If the cCstringcA is found
    within the given search criteria the return status is cGTRUEcA.

    cD%xfind-comcA "cCstringcA"; Default is cGcGfindcAcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDxfindcA executes the cDfind(1)cA command with the command line set by the
    ls%xfind-com(5)lm%xfind-com(5)le variable and the user supplied base-path and file-search
    regular expression. The output of the command is piped into the cD*find*cA
    buffer.

    If an argument is given then a lspipe-shell-command(2)lmpipe-shell-command(2)le is used instead of
    lsipipe-shell-command(2)lmipipe-shell-command(2)le, this is useful when used in macros as it ensures
    that cDfindcA has finished before the command returns.

    The find command is specified by the macro variable cD%xfind-comcA if not
    defined the default cGfindcA is used. The command line run by cDxfindcA is

    cC%xfind-comcA -name "cCbase-pathcA" -name "cCfile-searchcA" -print

    The resultant files found are displayed in the cD*find*cA buffer and may be
    selected by double-clicking with the mouse left button or selecting the
    line with a cG<RETURN>cA. The selected file under the cursor is loaded.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The cDxfindcA command does not typically need to be set up in UNIX
    environments. In the Microsoft Windows environment then the UNIX tools for
    Windows are recommended, available from:

         http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/

    The cDxfindcA command may be set up in the startup files as follows:-

    write-region - Write contents of region to named (new) file
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDwrite-regioncA "cCfile-namecA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDwrite-regioncA is used to write the contents of a selected region of a
    buffer to a NEW file i.e. where the region exists between cCpointcA__ and __cCmarkcA.

    cDwrite-buffercA writes the contents of the current region to the named file  
    cCfile-namecA. The action of the write also changes the file name associated
    with the current buffer to the new file name.

    On writing the region, if lstime(2m)lmtime(2m)le mode is enabled then the
    ls$timestamp(5)lmtime stample is searched for in the file and modified
    if located, to reflect the  modification date and time.

    If the region contains a lsnarrow(2m)lmnarrow(2m)le it will automatically be removed
    before saving so that the whole region is saved and restored when saving
    is complete.

    The argument cCncA may be used to change the default behavior of write-region
    described above, cCncA is a bit based flag where:-

    cD0x01cA
    
       Enables validity checks (default). These include a check that the
       proposed file does not already exist, if so confirmation of writing is
       requested from the user. Also MicroEmacs 2009 checks all other current
       buffers for one with the proposed file name, if found, again
       confirmation is requested. Without this flag the command will always
       succeed wherever possible.

    cD0x02cA
    
       Disables the expansion of any narrows (see lsnarrow-buffer(2)lmnarrow-buffer(2)le) before
       saving the buffer.


cENOTES cA


    lsundo(2)lmundo(2)le information may be discarded when the file is written.

    watch - Watch a file
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDwatchcA  
    cCncA cDwatch-resetcA  
    cDwatch-timecA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDwatchcA monitors a file on the file system by periodically polling the file
    and reacquiring the contents into a buffer. The command is typically used
    to monitor build and logging files as their output changes under control
    of a background process. Any number of files may be watched
    simultaneously, however to minimize the number of file system transfers,
    only those buffers that are being viewed in a window are updated.

    cDwatchcA operates in three different modes:-

    cDMode 1 (Reload)cA
    
       On a re-fresh the existing buffer is emptied and the file contents are
       re-read in their entirety from the file system if the file has
       changed. This is the default mode of operation.

    cDMode 2 (Reload, Append)cA
    
       On enabling the watch then the complete file is re-read, changes are
       subsequently read as deltas from the end of the file. This mode
       ensures that the buffer contents are up to date before incrementally
       reading the file.

    cDMode 3 (Append)cA
    
       On enabling the watch then only the end of the file that has not been
       read before is appended to the end of the buffer. This method is ideal
       for large log files.

    The operational mode may be selected by passing a numeric value of cG1cA, cG2cA or
    cG3cA to the cDwatchcA command. If no numeric argument is provided then the user
    is prompted for the operational mode.

    Whilst running in an append mode (cG2cA or cG3cA) then byte offset of the end of
    the file is retained for the next read. On the next read then any new
    information from the last saved byte offset to the end of the file is
    read, irrespective of any edits made to the buffer. Therefore if the
    buffer contents have been deleted on the next cCappendcA read then the buffer
    will contain the appended information only and not reacquire the
    information that has been deleted. Where the complete buffer is to be
    re-acquired then use cDMode 1cA.

    The buffer mode line is modified to show the watch state. i.e.

        ==W <buffer-name> ==============


    Invocation of cDwatchcA in a buffer that is being watched disables the watch.
    All watches may be removed from all buffers using `0 watch-reset`.

    cDwatch-timecA modifies the poll time of a watch. The user is prompted for the
    time period which is entered in seconds.

    cDwatch-resetcA re-evaluates the watches that are on the buffers reporting the
    number of files that are bing watched. When invoked with a cG0cA argument then
    any outstanding watch commands are removed.


cENOTES cA


    cDwatchcA is a macro implemented in cGwatch.emfcA.

    The commands cDwatch-resetcA and cDwatch-timecA are not available until a cDwatchcA
    command has been executed.


cEHISTORY cA


    cDwatchcA was developed in 2000 and appeared in MicroEmacs releases after this
    date however the comand was not exported to the user. The cDwatchcA command
    was fully integrated in the 2005 release.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDnotescA is a note database that allows miscellaneous text information to be
    organized and retained in a database. Each note is has a label associated
    with it which may be hierarchically organized into a tree of notes.

    Information that a programmer would typically put into a notes database
    may include:-

    - How to mount a CD-ROM on a remote UNIX system.
    - Boot strapping Linux.
    - Configuring the C compiler.
    - etc..

    This information would be hierarchically organized by system, function
    etc. The content typically represents a snippet of information from a
    diverse range of subjects that probably needs to be accessed infrequently
    but organized in such a way that it may be located quickly when required.

    On running cDnotescA then a new frame is created (retaining the existing
    window configuration) and the user is prompted to create a new notes file
    with their user name, accept this option and a new notes file is created
    in the JASSPA home directory. The user is presented with a split view
    window as follows:-

        +-------------+-----------------------------------+
        | + user Pad  |Text associated with the note.     |
        |*  +- info 1 |                                   |
        |   +- info 2 |Anything may be typed in here.     |
        |             |                                   |

        +-------------------------------------------------+


    The left pane comprises a tree of note titles, the right pane contains the
    text note body of the selected note title. Free form text may be entered
    into the text body pane.

    Notes are add and removed from the notes tree pane. A mouse right click
    presents a menu of options that operate on the current node as follows:-

    cDTidy TreecA - cGtcA/cGreturncA
    
       At the current node then close the note hierarchy. cGtcA will close the
       node a RETURN at the node will open or close it, depending on the
       current state.

    cDRename NotecA - cGrcA
    
       Edit the name of the note, a dialog is presented and a free form label
       of the note may be edited.

    cDDelete NotecA - cGdeletecA
    
       Delete the note from the tree. This deletes the label and the note. if
       the note has any children then all children are deleted.

    cDCut NotecA - cGxcA
    
       Delete a note, including any child notes from the tree, allowing the
       cut information to be pasted back to a different location in the tree.
       (See cDPastecA cDNotecA).

    cDPaste NotecA - cGvcA
    
       Inserts a cut note (or note tree) back into the list at the current
       position.

    cDMove Note UpcA - cGucA
    
       Move a note up the tree hierarchy, at the same level.

    cDMove Note DowncA - cGdcA
    
       Move a note down the tree hierarchy, at the same level.

    cDInsert New NotecA - cGinsertcA
    
       Insert a new note as a child of the current node. The user is prompted
       for the name of the note, the name may be entered and the cursor is
       left in the body pane for text entry.

    cDForward NotecA - cGncA
    
       Moves to the next note. Within the note window then cDC-page-downcA
       similarly advances to the next note.

    cDBackward NotecA - cGpcA
    
       Moves to the previous note. Within the note window then cDC-page-upcA
       similarly advances to the previous note.

    cDSearch ForwardcA - `esc s`
    
       Search in a forwards direction from the current note.

    cDSearch BackwardcA - `esc C-s`
    
       Search in a backwards direction from the current note.

    cDOpen Notes FilecA
    
       Opens a new notes file, the user is explicitly prompted for the name
       of the notes file to open.

    cDSave Notes FilecA
    
       Saves the notes file to the file system.

    cDHide NotescA
    
       Hides the notes window and restores the exiting buffer windows prior
       to the cDnotescA invocation.

    To quit cDnotescA then delete the buffer using cDC-x C-kcA or run the command
    cDnotes-closecA command.

    The notes file may be saved like any other buffer using lssave-buffer(2)lmsave-buffer(2)le
    (cGC-x C-scA). This saves the tree and the notes. Auto-save is automatically
    enabled.

    cDnotes-closecA closes the notes frame and returns the user to the existing
    windows, retaining the same screen layout. The notes file is still
    resident in the editor and may be restored with a cDnotescA command.

    cDnotes-filecA opens a new notes file, the user is explicitly prompted for the
    name of the notes file. There are no restrictions on the number of notes
    files that may be created. cDnotes-import-skwyrulcA imports a Skwyrul index
    file (cGskwyrul_l.htmcA) into MicroEmacs notes format. This command is not
    available on line as it is likely to be used very infrequently. To load
    the command then load the file cGnotesutl.emfcA and execute the buffer
    lsexecute-buffer(2)lmexecute-buffer(2)le (esc x execute-buffer). The command may be explicitly
    run using cGesc xcA cGnotes-import-skwyrulcA.

    cDnotes-instantcA creates a new note under the cCInstant NotescA folder, it is
    designed to enable the user to jot something down quickly and in a safe
    place. The note is automatically named and is the fastest method of adding
    a note. This may be invoked outside of the notes window, on invocation
    then a new notes node is created and the content of the note added.

    cDnotes-contextcA is similar to cDnotes-instantcA but a bit more advanced and
    allows a note to be created that is associated with a buffer. When working
    on a file (source code, document etc.). It is sometimes useful to be able
    to associate some information with that file, typically this is done with
    something like a cGTODO:cA comment, however this is not always appropriate.
    cDnotes-contextcA attempts to address this, it works from the current buffers
    filename path and attempts to locate an existing note for it, if no note
    is found then a new one is created. When locating a note it looks down the
    path. The command may be invoked outside of the notes window, on
    invocation then a new notes node is created and the content of the note
    added.


cEText Hilighting  cA


    Blocks of text within the notes body may be highlighted. The special
    constructs of cG>format>cA ... cG>end>cA located on the left margin introduce and
    close a highlighting style. i.e.

        >c>
        /* This is a C code insert */
        >end>

        >perl>
        # This is a perl insert
        >end>


    The keywords that are supported are:-

        `>emf>` - MicroEmacs macro files.
        `>pseudo>` - Pseudo code.
        `>bnf>` - BNF.
        `>c>` - C programming language
        `>cpp>` - C++ programming language
        `>perl>` - Perl programming language
        `>tcl>` - TCL programming language
        `>shell>` - UNIX shell scripts
        `>make>` - Makefile scripts
        `>end>` - Ends the highlighting block.


cENOTES cA


    cDnotescA is a macro implemented in cGnotes.emfcA. The database information is
    stored in a single file cCusercAcD.enfcA. The file comprises both the index and
    the text.

    The implementation of cDnotescA uses lsnarrow-buffer(2)lmnarrow-buffer(2)le to hide information for
    each note page. The lsRegistrylmRegistryle is used to store and display the note tree
    labels.

    read-session - Read in session information
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDread-sessioncA [ "cCsession-filecA" ]


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDread-sessioncA reads in a MicroEmacs 2009 session file, setting the current
    session information. If argument cDncA is not given then the given
    "cCsession-filecA" is simply read in. If a non-zero argument is specified then
    default session is set to the given file-name and the file is read. If an
    argument of zero is given then the default session is re-read. Information
    read in (and saved) from the history file includes:-

    - Searching and replacing history.
    - Buffer name history.
    - Command name history.
    - File name history.
    - General (all the rest) history.
    - Buffer and file list with line numbers.

    MicroEmacs 2009's environment may be retained almost intact by the use of
    the default session and using the cD-ccA (continue) command-line option to
    re-load all files that were being edited in a previous session.

    On loading a new session then the user is prompted to save the current
    session. If the numeric argument is zero (bit 0 is 0) then the user is not
    prompted and the cCsession-filecA is effectively loaded and merged into the
    current session.


cENOTES cA


    When running multiple MicroEmacs 2009 sessions on the same work-station
    (or different workstations sharing the same home directory), the default
    history is saved when MicroEmacs 2009 exits. As a result the last
    MicroEmacs 2009 sessions that terminates writes the history information
    used next time.

    The session information is saved in a registry format file (see lsesf(8)lmesf(8)le).
    Reference should be made to the notes included in lserf(8)lmerf(8)le as to how the
    history file may be edited and effected in the same MicroEmacs 2009
    session.

    The user may now have multiple sessions, this is useful when one is
    working on different projects, the sessions are created using
    lssave-session(3)lmsave-session(3)le using a new session name. Starting the editor with a
    different session means that the hilighting scheme may be different
    between different sessions i.e. "cCBluecA cCHuecA" and "cCSherwoordcA cCForestcA". Note
    that the color scheme should be changed with lschange-scheme(3)lmchange-scheme(3)le and not with
    lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le if different sessions are to use different color schemes.


cECommand Line  cA


    Reading a session is generally performed when a MicroEmacs session is
    started using the "cD-ccA" command line option rather than from the emacs mode
    line or main menu, see lsme(1)lmme(1)le. Invoking

       cDme -ccA_<mySessionName>_

    where cC<mySessionName>cA is the name of the session (the ls$MENAME(5)lm$MENAME(5)le or system
    login name) will restore all of of the buffers, windows layout, point and
    mark positions, main window size etc. at the point of the last shut down.
    e.g. given a system login name of cCjasspacA then

       cDme -ccA_jasspa_

    restores the session to the state when cCjasspacA last exited MicroEmacs. When
    the session name is specified then no other files should be specified, so
    the command line

       cDme -ccAcCjasspacA cGmorefiles.txtcA

    restores the buffers but does not restore the window layout because this
    has been destroyed by the introduction of the new file cGcGmorefiles.txtcAcA.
    This type of command with another file behaves as the old cG`me -c`cA command
    prior to the 2006 release that did not support sessions. If
    cC<mySessionName>cA is not specified then the buffers are restored but the
    window layout is not restored.

    Compare.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDxdiffcA is a macro wrapper that invokes an external graphical file
    difference utility, named after the original X-Windows utility of the same
    name. The utility will usually display two files side by side and color
    code the differences, the differences may then be selected to merge the
    changes into a new output file which may (or may not) overwrite one of the
    original input files.

    cDxdiffcA executes the difference utility cDxdiff(1)cA command (or equivalent)
    with the command line set by the cD%xdiff-comcA variable and the user supplied
    files cCleftVersioncA and cCrightVersioncA. The command line variables are
    referenced from the cD%xdiff-comcA as follows:

    cD%lfcA
    
       The absolute file name of the left-hand file, cCleftVersioncA.

    cD%rfcA
    
       The absolute file name of the right-hand file, cCrightVersioncA.

    cD%lncA
    
       The base name of the left-hand file, cCleftVersioncA.

    cD%rncA
    
       The base name of the left-hand file, cCleftVersioncA.

    The cD%xdiff-comcA variable should include the appropriate command to invoke
    the difference utility and use cD%cA place holders for the arguments.
    MicroEmacs will fill in the cD%cA arguments with their correct values on
    invocation.

    cDUNIXcA
    
       UNIX environments may use cDxdiff(1)cA which is available from
       cDhttp://reality.sgiweb.org/rudy/xdiff/cA. The variable command line may
       be defined as:

sB
              set-variable %xdiff-com "xdiff -wb %lf %rf"

sA
    The cD-wbcA options will ignore while space and trailing blanks.

    cDMicrosoft WindowscA
    
       Microsoft Windows environments may use something like cDBeyond ComparecA.
       The variable command line may be defined as:

sB
              set-variable %xdiff-com "bc2.exe %lf %rf /title1=%lt /title2=%rt"

sA
    In this case the cD%ltcA values have been used for the title names for each of
    the windows in the utility.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The ClearCase and sub-commands provide MicroEmacs with an interface to IBM
    Rational Software cDClearCase(1)cA. cDClearCasecA is a version control system;
    using it, you can record the history of your source file modifications.
    ClearCase is licensed from IBM Rational and is widely used in a commercial
    environment, see the documentation provided with ClearCase for more
    information on its features and use.

    The cDClearCasecA directory should be defined to MicroEmacs using lscc-setup(3)lmcc-setup(3)le
    which enables extensions in the lsfile-browser(3)lmfile-browser(3)le with an additional
    cGcG*cc-console*cAcA window. The cGcG*files*cAcA window includes additional columns
    showing the ClearCase state, revision and repository date. The
    functionality of the file-browser is the same as a non-ClearCase folder
    with the exception that additional ClearCase item controls are located in
    the mouse context menu (opened by clicking the right mouse button in the
    cG*files*cA buffer). This menu item opens another sub-menu providing access to
    the items below. When selecting commands than a pop-up check-box may be
    displayed which allows options to be selected for the command.

    cDCurrent StatecA
    
       Checks the state of selected file(s) or directory against the
       repository. Differences detected are shown in the cG*cc-state*cA window.
       This provides a quick method of determining the working directory
       state.

       The cG*cc-state*cA buffer supports some of the same features as a
       directory listing, the files can be loaded (using cGreturncA or left click
       on the file name), selected (using space or left mouse button on the
       left hand edge) and ClearCase commands executed from the window
       operate either on the selected files or the listed files if no files
       are selected.

    cDUpdate ElementscA
    
       Updates the currently selected files, files are selected by clicking
       the left button to the left of the required file name. Multiple files
       may be selected by 'dragging' a hilight region over the required
       files.

    cDClear CC consolecA
    
       Clears the cC*cc-console*cA buffer.

    The following sections describe some of the ClearCase commands that are
    available, a full list of commands may be found using lscommand-apropos(2)lmcommand-apropos(2)le
    searching for cDcccA which provides a full list of all of the ClearCase
    related commands.

    The cDcc-addcA command adds the current buffer file to the repository.

    The cDcc-checkoutcA command checks out a file or directory from the repository
    into the current directory, the read-only status of the file is changed to
    read-write, the user is prompted for a comment which will be used on a
    subsequent check-in operation. The user specifies the file on the message
    line.

    The cDcc-checkincA command commits any changes made to the currently buffer's
    file (including additions) to the repository. The user is prompted for a
    commit log message, the file state will change to read-only.

    The cDcc-diffcA command opens a cC*cc-diff*cA window displaying the differences
    between the current buffer's local file and repository version. If the
    current buffer is a directory list it will list all the differences found
    in all files within the directory.

    The cDcc-deletecA command removes the current buffer's file from the
    repository.

    The cDcc-statecA command opens a cC*cc-state*cA window listing the state of any
    file in the current directory which is not up-to-date. Note that unlike
    most ClearCase sub commands this command executes over all files in the
    current buffer's file directory.

    The cDcc-updatecA command updates all files in the current directory, the
    output being reported to a new cC*cc-update*cA window. Note that unlike most
    ClearCase sub commands this command executes over all files in the current
    buffer's file directory.


cESetup  cA


    cDcc-setupcA provides a dialog interface to configure the MicroEmacs ClearCase
    interface if required. The VOB view location in the file system should be
    added for each view that is to be access by MicroEmacs.

    A cDToolscA tab exists to configure each of the cDcleartool(1)cA options, these
    may be configured to suite the users preferences.

    cDcc-setupcA may also be accessed from lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le from the cDMiscellaneouscA
    configuration.


cEClearCase File Browser  cA


    The cDClearCase File BrowsercA is an extension to the lsfile-browser(3)lmfile-browser(3)le and
    shows the state of ClearCase files in a directory listing.

    cDpassword-to-phoniccA "cCpasswordcA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The password commands are typically used by a system administrator to
    generate new random passwords or to phonically unambiguously describe a
    password.

    cDinsert-passwordcA generates a new random password string and inserts the
    generated password with phonic description into the current buffer. The
    generated password minimally includes include at least one each of
    lowercase, uppercase and numeric characters. The default length of the
    password is 8 characters, the numeric argument cCncA changes the length of the
    generated password and must be at least 3 characters long. Running 4
    insert-password to generate a 4 character password generates:

         y5Ck (yankee - Five - CHARLIE - kilo)


    cDpassword-to-phoniccA converts a string of characters to the phonic alphabet,
    the command requires a single argument cCpasswordcA which is converted to a
    phonic string. The command cDpassword-to-phoniccA "cCy5CkcA" inserts the phonic
    string into the buffer:

         yankee - Five - CHARLIE - kilo

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDfindcA performs a search for files in the current directory (or from
    cCstarting-pathcA) using built in MicroEmacs 2009 constructs rather than
    relying on any external executables such as cDfind(1)cA. cDfindcA operates in
    exactly the same way as a traditional cCfindcA command line utility and uses a
    command line option sequence from the MicroEmacs 2009 command line. The
    cCfile-optionscA allow recursive and regular expression searches, searching
    against the file modification time etc. The command line takes the user
    supplied cCfile-optionscA, cCfile-maskcA and cCstarting-pathcA. The output of the
    command is piped into the cD*find*cA buffer.

    cCfind-optionscA
    
       Defines the cCoptionscA that are specified on the command line, the
       default options may also be defined with the cDfile-setup(3)cA command
       invoked from the command line or from the the cDToolscA menu. The
       cCfind-optionscA are defined as follows:

       cD-2cA
    
         List the file and directory attributes in the output (directory
          list sort key)

cENOTES cA


    - Directories are not considered binary files, so cD-bcA will not exclude
          them.
    - The default when no options are given will be cD-XGPrdfMIBLcA, default
          options can be set via the find-setup command (sets the
          /history/find-com registry entry).
    - Use of cD-wcA on directories searches for cC<search-pattern>cA within the
          MicroEmacs 2009 directory listing, the command is then the same as
    - lsgrep(3)lmgrep(3)le except for the output buffer format.
    - String searches of cD-wcA are not performed on files that exceed 100Mb
          unless the -u option is specified on the command line. This prevents
          MicroEmacs 2009 from loading exceptionally large files unless

|grep
    cDgrepcA ["_grep-options_"] cCsearch-patterncA "cCfile-maskcA" ["_file-mask_"...]
    ["starting-path"]


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDgrepcA performs a search for a pattern and displays all lines that contain
    that pattern within files in the current directory (or from cCstarting-pathcA)
    using built in MicroEmacs 2009 constructs rather than relying on any
    external executables such as cDgrep(1)cA. cDgrepcA operates in exactly the same
    way as a traditional cCgrepcA command line utility and uses a command line
    option sequence from the MicroEmacs 2009 command line. The cCgrep-optionscA
    allow recursive and regular expression searches, searching against the
    file modification time etc. The command line takes the user supplied
    cCgrep-optionscA, cCsearch-patterncA, cCfile-maskcA and cCstarting-pathcA. The output of
    the command is piped into the cD*grep*cA buffer.

    cCgrep-optionscA
    
       Defines the cCoptionscA that are specified on the command line, the
       default options may also be defined with the lsfind-setup(3)lmfind-setup(3)le command
       invoked from the command line or from the the cDToolscA menu. The
       cCgrep-optionscA are defined as follows:

       cD-acA
    
         Re-read all out of date buffers, prevents a manual prompt,
              equivalent of Yes to all. This is the inverse of -o

       cD-bcA

         Do not use existing buffer of loaded files.

       cD-mcA
    
         Search pattern is a regular expression.

       cD-McA
    
         Search pattern is not a regular expression.

       cD-ocA
    
         Do not re-read all out of date buffers, prevents a manual prompt,
              equivalent of No to all. This is the inverse of -a.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDencasecA provides a short cut to encapsulate a selected region of text with
    a cCstart-stringcA and cCend-stringcA pattern. The command is modal and operates
    in two different operating modes as follows.

    First run cDencasecA without a current region section (i.e. no selected
    highlighted text) and the user is prompted for the cCstart-stringcA and
    cCend-stringcA. The user is also prompted if the command has not been run
    before and the cCstart-stringcA and cCend-stringcA are undefined.

    With the strings defined then select a region with the mouse or keyboard
    (cDesc spacecA and cDmovecA or cDS-movecA) to define the start and end point of the
    region. With a selected region then execute the cDencasecA command using cDesc xcA
    cDencasecA. This is most effective when bound to a simple key, see

    cDnumber-itemscA cCstart-numbercC cAchar-widthcC cAnum-linescA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDnumber-itemscA provides a short cut method of re-numbering a list of
    vertically aligned numbered items. The command assumes a fixed width
    number per line. The command operates from the current cursor position in
    a downward direction. The parameters are defined as follows:

    cCstart-numbercA
    
       The value of the first item to renumber.

    cCchar-widthcA
    
       The width of the number space i.e. 1-10 is a width of 2, 89-101 is a
       width of 3.

    cCnum-linescA
    
       The number of lines to re-number, including the current line.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following code fragment shows how a list is renumbered.

        MY_COMMAND (myCMD_UP,   # 9, "Move Up")
        MY_COMMAND (myCMD_DOWN,  10, "Move down")
        MY_COMMAND (myCMD_LEFT,  15, "Move down")
        MY_COMMAND (myCMD_RIGHT, 10, "Move down")


    To to use the command to renumber the list from 100 to 103 then the cursor
    is placed at the left hand side where the number should start. In the
    example this is cG#cA, then issue the command cDesc xcA cDnumber-itemscA cD100cA cD3cA cD4cA. This
    renumbers the list resulting in the following:

        MY_COMMAND (myCMD_UP,   100, "Move Up")
        MY_COMMAND (myCMD_DOWN, 101, "Move down")
        MY_COMMAND (myCMD_LEFT, 102, "Move down")

    are probably  more  similar to that what new users  expect.  To  not  break
    the original Emacs  key-bindings all Geany key-bindings are prefixed with the
    cCCtrl-jcA  key. The menu  entries can be as well  adapted to show the changed
    key-bindings using the command cDjeany-osdcA, these changed menu entries can
    be reverted to the normal key bindings using the command cDjeany-osd-undocA.
    The  following  key-bindings  are  currently  available  if you  execute the
    command cDjeany-bindingscA:

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The git and sub-commands provide MicroEmacs with an interface to cDgit(1)cA.
    cDGitcA is a distributed version control system; using it, you can record the history of
    your source file modifications. Git is licensed under the GNU General
    Public License 2.0 and is freely available on the Internet, see the
    documentation provided with Git for more information on its features and
    use.

    The MicroEmacs cDgitcA command opens a little file viewer in *files' buffer with an
    including additional columns showing the Git state.

    The cDgit-addcA command adds the current buffers file to the repository. Note
    that this command only performs the local addition, a cCgit-commitcA is
    required to make the addition permanent.

    The  cDgit-branchcA  command shows the current branch you are working on and
    lists all available branches on the message line. To checkout/switch to an other
    branch use cCgit-checkoutcA.

    The cDgit-checkoutcA command checks out a git branch from the repository into the
    current directory if there is more than one branch available. 
    The user specifies the branch on the message line with TAB completion.
    Please note that this might lead to open files which does not exists in the current
    branch or files with a different content. 
    If you continue to edit these files you get the message that the file is changed. 
    Usually you will close non-existing files without saving them and use cCreread-filecA
    or cCreread-allcA to update your editor.

    The cDgit-commitcA command commits any changes made to the currently buffer's
    file (including additions) to the repository. The user is prompted for a
    commit log message.

    The cDgit-diffcA command opens a cC*git-diff*cA window displaying the differences
    between the current buffer's local file and repository version. If the
    current buffer is a directory list it will list all the differences found
    in all files within the directory.

    The cDgit-grepcA command opens a cC*git-grep*cA window after prompting the user for
    a text string which can be as well a regular expressions and searches the files
    in the repository for the given text string. The results can be picked with the 
    mouse to jump to the given position in the file with the matching string.
    
    The cDgit-logcA command opens a cC*git-log*cA window displaying the Git log of the
    current buffer's file.

    The cDgit-mvcA command allows to rename the current buffer file to a new
    repository file. The removal of the old filename is done automatically via
    a commit message.

    The cDgit-rmcA command removes the current buffer's file from the
    repository - PLEASE NOTE THIS CAN LEAD TO LOST DATA!!! This command only
    performs the local removal; as it deletes the buffer and file the
    cDgit-commitcA command cannot be used to commit the removal to the git
    repository. Instead the  cDgit(1)cA application itself must  be used.

    The cDgit-pullcA command updates all files in the current directory, the
    output being reported to a new cC*git-pull*cA window. Note that unlike most
    git sub commands this command executes over all files in the current
    buffer's file directory.

    The cDgit-statecA command opens a cC*git-state*cA window listing the state of any
    file in the current directory which is not up-to-date. Note that unlike
    most git sub commands this command executes over all files in the current
    buffer's file directory.

    The cDgit-statuscA command opens a cC*git-state*cA window and shows the state of
    the current buffer in the window including the modification state,
    repository etc.

    The cDgit-tagcA  command  displays either all existing tags or allows you to
    enter a new tag name if a numerical argument of 1 is given by asking for the
    tag name and a message.

    cDxrdb-schemecA ["theme-name"]
     
cEDESCRIPTION cA
     
    Loads X11-themes stored in xrdb files from the folder cGthemescA in the
    users config  folder  usually  cG~/.jasspacA  or  cG~/.config/jasspacA  into the
    running editor session. Themes in xrdb format are available from 
    https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/tree/master/xrdb
    The files needs to be saved as cGTHEME-NAME.xrdbcA in the cGthemescA folder.
    If the users executed the cGxrdb-schemecA command without a theme name as 
    argument an interactive menu is presented which show all available menues in
    the themes folder. So a typical themes folder might look like this;

          $ ls ~/.jasspa/themes/*.xrdb

    To change the colors for a xrdb scheme you have to edit the xrdb 
    file directly. Here is an example on how you can install a theme 
    into your users ME configuation folder:
    
         mkdir ~/.jasspa/themes
         wget -O ~/.jasspa/themes/mathias.xrdb \

    The cDr-doccA macro displays in a hypertext browser with R syntax hilighting
    the manual pages for R packages or R functions.

    You can fold or unfold the section and use the  lsitem-list(3)lmitem-list(3)le
    command  to  navigate  the  documentation  sections.  If no argment is given
    requests  a package or  function  name from the user via the  command  line.
    Package    overview   pages   should   be   requested   using   the   syntax
    "package::pkgname", documentation for specific functions should be requested
    using the syntax  "pkgname::funcname".  Links to other  functions and to the
    main package  overview are shown with hilights in the normal text. Usage and
    Examples sections use R highlighting.
    
    The cDr-execcA  macro executes the currently edited R script file using the
    Rscript interpreter. It uses the current selected character encoding as 
    an argument for the Rscript interpreter to avoid error messages due to 
    wrong characters. If a numeric argument is given the user is asked for possible
    command line arguments.

    The cDr-formatcA  macro formats the currently edited R script file using the

    If bit  cG0x01cA  of the  numeric  argument  cCncA is  clear  then all  modified
    buffers are automatically saved, when set (the default) the user is prompted for
    each  buffer. If bit cG0x02cA of the numeric  argument is clear (the  default)
    the user is prompted for any additional  cCcommand-line-argumentscA  which are
    passed to the Tcl command. The arguments given are stored in a buffer variable,
    cD:tcl-exec-argscA, and used as the default arguments next time the script is executed.
    
    After  executing the script, a cG*tcl-exec*cA  buffer is opened with the output
    of the script execution.If any numeric argument is given before calling
    the script, then the user is asked for command line arguments which should
    be given on the message line.

    After executing the macro a popup-window (cG*tcl-exec*cA) displays the results
    of the script  execution. The user can click on the hilighted  lines showing
    warnings and errors and jump directly to the problematic  line in the source
    script.  The  same  can  be  achieved  by  pressing  the  ENTER  key  on the
    highlighted line using the keyboard.

    set-variable cC%go-comcA "cCstringcA"  
     
cEDESCRIPTION cA
     
    The cDgo-formatcA macro formats the currently edited file using the
    default formatter cGgo fmtcA You can  change  the  value  of the  variable
    cC%go-format-optscA  for instance like this: 
    
          __set-variable__ _%go-format-opts_ "_go fmt -r '(a) -> a' -w  %s_"

    The cDgo-lintcA macro checks the currently edited file using the standard
    command `go vet`.

    After executing the macro cDgo-lintcA a popup-window (cG*go-lint*cA) displays the
    warning messages of the cGgo vetcA program, the user can click on the hilighted 
    lines showing warnings and jump directly to the problematic line. The same
    can be achieved by pressing th ENTER key on the highlighted line using
    the keyboard navigating to the warning or error line and pressing the ENTER key.

    Setting the variable cC%go-lint-optscA allows you to customize the linter
    settings. similar to the cGgo fmtcA settings shown above.

    The cDgo-execcA macro executed the currently edited file using the `go run`
    call for that file. Before the script is executed lssave-some-buffers(2)lmsave-some-buffersle
    is executed to allow the user to ensure that all relevant buffers are saved.
    If bit  cG0x01cA  of the  numeric  argument  cCncA is  clear  then all  modified
    buffers are automatically saved, when set (the default) the user is prompted for
    each  buffer. If bit cG0x02cA of the numeric  argument is clear (the  default)
    the user is prompted for any additional  cCcommand-line-argumentscA  which are
    passed to the Go application. The arguments given are stored in a buffer variable,
    cD:go-exec-argscA, and used as the default arguments next time the script is executed.

    cCncA cDfile-execcA  
    cDfile-formatcA  
    cDfile-lintcA    

     
cEDESCRIPTION cA
     
    The three commands described below require the definition of global variables 
    which should declare the command lines to be used for executing, linting or 
    formatting the current file. The variable names are of type:
    
    cC%fhook-FHOOK-(exec|format|lint)cA 
    
    where cCFHOOKcA is the file hook name of the file. The variable declaration
    can be added to the users configuration file, cCUSERNAME.emfcA or into the
    cCmyFHOOK.emfcA file within the users configuration folder. These variables
    should point to the tool or compiler or interpreter and take place holders
    for the filename or the file buffer basename like this:

    - "%f" - the filename of the currently edited file  
    - "%b" - the basename of the current file, so the name without the extension and
             the directory part
    
    For more usable abbreviations see the help page of the  lsfile-tool-setup(3)lmfile-tool-setup(3)le
    macro.

    The variable cC%fhook-FHOOK-formatcA can take as well the value "restyle-buffer",
    so that the macro lsrestyle-buffer(3lmrestyle-buffer(3)le] is executed for the current 
    buffer. This is useful if there is no sophisticated formatting tool is 
    available for the programming language. See below for an example using the
    Freebasic compiler for linting and executing and ME for formatting.
      
    See below for a few examples to declare some variables.
    
    The cDfile-execcA  macro executes or compiles the currently edited file using 
    a global variable which needs to be defined for the current file hook. See below
    for a few examples for defining these global variables. If a numeric argument
    is given the user is asked for possible command line arguments. After executing 
    this macro a popup-window command should appear showing the output or possible 
    errors of the code.

    The cDfile-formatcA macro formats the currently edited  file using the
    a language specific formatter which needs to be defined using an user defined
    global file hook dependent variable. See below for a few examples.
    
    The cDfile-lintcA   macro checks the currently edited file using an user an user
    defined global variable for the current file hook.

    After executing the macro a popup-window (cG*file-lint*cA) displays the
    warning messages of the linter, the user can click on the hilighted lines
    showing warnings and that way jumping directly to the problematic line. This
    requires that the linter defined in the variable supports the
    cC^FILENAME:LINE:CHARcA syntax. The same can jumping to the error be achieved
    by pressing the ENTER key on the hilighted line.
    
    These three macros can be seen as simplified  versions for the Go, Python, R
    and Tcl macros like  cDgo-lintcA,  cDgo-formatcA,  cDgo-execcA.  They can be
    used as well to use  alternative  tools for  formatting  and linting as well
    allow easy support of other  programming  languages for linting,  formatting
    and running the currently edited file.

    user-setup - Configure MicroEmacs for a specific user
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDuser-setupcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDuser-setupcA provides a dialog interface to enable the user to configure the
    editor. cDuser-setupcA may be invoked from the main cCHelpcA menu or directly from
    the command line using lsexecute-named-command(2)lmexecute-named-command(2)le. cDuser-setupcA configures the
    user's setup registry file, "cC<logname>cAcG.erfcA" which is used by MicroEmacs to
    initialize the environment to a user's preference.

    Note, if your screen is too small to display the whole dialog, it may be
    moved using any key bound to the scroll commands such as cDscroll-upcA, e.g.
    cGA-upcA, cGC-zcA, cGA-downcA, cGC-vcA, cGA-leftcA etc. For systems without mouse support, the
    cGtabcA key may be used to move between fields.

    On all pages the following buttons are available at the bottom of the
    dialog and have the following effect:

    cGSavecA
    
       Saves the changes made to the users registry file, i.e.
       "cC<Log-Name>cAcG.erfcA" but does not re-initialize MicroEmacs. Some changes,
       such as color scheme changes, only take effect when the cDCurrentcA button
       is used or when MicroEmacs is restarted.

    cGCurrentcA
    
       Makes the current user and the changes made Current to this MicroEmacs
       session, dismissing the cDuser-setupcA dialog and reinitializing
       MicroEmacs. This also saves the registry file out!

    cGCancelcA
    
       Quits cDuser-setupcA, if changes where not cDSavecAd or made cDCurrentcA they will
       be lost.

    The following pages, which appear in the dialog, are defined as follows:-


cEStart-up  cA


    `User Name`
    
       Documents the user name currently being configured, this entry cannot
       be changed in user-setup, see ls$user-name(5)lm$user-name(5)le for help on changing the
       MicroEmacs user name.

    `User Path`
    
       Documents the location of the current user's MicroEmacs setup files,
       this entry cannot be changed in user-setup, see ls$user-path(5)lm$user-path(5)le for help
       on changing the user path.

    `Setup File`
    
       Sets the personal user setup macro file name which is executed at
       start-up. A user macro file should contain all personal settings such
       as preferred key bindings etc. See lsUserProfiles(2)lmSetting Up A User Profilele for more
       information. The cDEditcA check box can be used to enable/disable the
       automatic loading of the setup file ready for editing when the cDCurrentcA
       button is used.

    `Company File`
    
       Sets the company setup macro file name which is executed at start-up.
       A company macro file should contain all company wide standard settings
       such as cG%company-namecA, No cG.emfcA extension is supplied. 
       See lsCompanyProfiles(2)lmCompany Profilele for more information.

    cGEmulationcA
    
       Sets an emulation mode which changes the behaviour on MicroEmacs to
       emulate another editor/program; this is done by executing a macro file
       at start-up. An emulation macro file should contain the macro code
       required to simulate the environment of the other editor. MicroEmacs
       2009 is released with four emulation modes, GNU Emacs (see macro file
       cGmeemacs.emfcA), CUA (Windows style key bindings and interface, see
       cGmecua.emfcA), MicroEmacs v3.8 (cGmeme3_8.emfcA) and NEdit v5 which is at
       best a demonstration of what can be achieved via the emulation support
       (defined in cGmenedit.emfcA). See lsCompatibility(2)lmCompatibilityle for more information on
       emulation.

       In case you  change  the  keyboard  mapping  you  should in most cases
       restart the editor to avoid possible problems. Since 2023 the CUA
       emulation seems to work reasonable well. But if you switch back to 
       no-emulation mode you have to restart the editor.

    `Rebind Home Keys`
    
       When enabled the following key bindings are created to ease
       frustration, particularly for MS users:

        cGhomecA -
              Bound to beginning-of-line instead of beginning-of-buffer.

         cGendcA -
              Bound to end-of-line instead of end-of-buffer.

        cGC-homecA -
              Bound to beginning-of-buffer.

        cGC-endcA -
              Bound to end-of-buffer.

    `MS Shift Region`
    
       Enables/disables cursor key manipulation with the shift key similar to
       the conventional Microsoft region selection. When enabled, pressing
       the shift key in conjunction with the cursor movement keys selects a
       region which is hilighted. Once the region is selected then the
       cG<DELETE>cA or cG<BACKSPACE>cA key erases the selected region. This also
       enables a similar behaviour with the Mouse cDDrag regioncA driver, see
       below.


cELocale Setup  cA


    cGKeyboardcA
    
       Configures MicroEmacs to the user's keyboard. Accent character
       generation keys present on foreign keyboards cannot be automatically
       supported on Windows platforms. MicroEmacs must be informed of the
       keyboard being used to correctly interpret the keys. If a required
       keyboard is not supported please see lsfaq38(0f)lmFAQ38le on how to setup the
       keyboard, also see lslocaleSupport(2)lmLocale Supportle.

    cGLanguagecA
    
       Sets the user language, this sets the word (or letter) characters and
       if available sets up lsspell(2)lmspell(2)le with appropriate spelling rules and
       dictionaries. For more information on adding support for a language
       see lslocaleSupport(2)lmLocale Supportle.

    cDNOTEScA
    
       Earlier versions MicroEmacs had cGcG(Ext)cAcA languages which use extended
       language dictionaries, vastly increasing the word list. New versions
       automatically test for and use these dictionaries if available.

       In earlier versions a personal dictionary name could be set in the
       next field, this option was removed on Oct 2001. Instead a personal
       dictionary for each language is automatically created for you, any
       words or auto-corrected words will be added to the current languages
       personal dictionary. The name of dictionary is "cGlsdpcA_<lang-id>_cG.edfcA"
       where "cC<lang-id>cA" is the 4 letter MicroEmacs language name (e.g.
       cGcGenuscAcA for American), simply rename any existing personal dictionary
       to this new name.

    `Auto Save Dictionaries`
    
       Enables auto-saving of any changed dictionaries on exit. If this is
       disabled the user is prompted to save for each changed dictionary.

    `Enable Auto-Spell`
    
       Enables Auto Spell Checking in file types which support this feature
       (usually text based files such as lstxt(9)lmtxt(9)le or lsnroff(9)lmnroff(9)le files etc). Auto
       spell detects word breaks as you type and checks the spelling of every
       completed word hilighting any erroneous words in the error color
       scheme (usually red). When auto-spell is enable, right clicking on an
       erroneous word will add an extra cDAuto SpellcA sub-menu to the opened
       context menu, the sub-menu lists suggested corrections and other
       useful options; this menu can also be opened by executing the
       lsauto-spell-menu(3)lmauto-spell-menu(3)le command (usually bound to "C-f7"). The feature can
       be manually enabled and disabled by invoking the lsauto-spell(3)lmauto-spell(3)le
       command.


cEGeneral  cA


    `Full Name`
    
       This should be set to the user's name and is used in a variety of
       places, e.g. by lsetfinsrt(3)lmetfinsrt(3)le to set the "Created By" field in a
       template.

    `Organizer File`
    
       Sets the organizer file base name, defaults to the cDLog NamecA. When
       notes and addresses are stored using lsorganizer(3)lmorganizer(3)le the file
       "cC<Organizer>cAcG.eofcA" is used.

    `Global Modes`
    
       Sets the initial state of the global ls$quiet(5)lmquiet(5)le global variable.

    `Search Modes`
    
       Sets the initial state of the global search modes lsexact(2m)lmexact(2m)le and
       lsmagic(2m)lmmagic(2m)le. This indirectly executes lsglobal-mode(2)lmglobal-mode(2)le to set the required
       modes.

    `Buffer Modes`
    
       Sets the initial state of the global modes lsauto(2m)lmauto(2m)le, lsbackup(2m)lmbackup(2m)le,
       lstab(2m)lmtab(2m)le and lsundo(2m)lmundo(2m)le, any buffers created will inherit the state of
       these modes. However, as changing these modes directly effects only
       the global modes, any existing buffers (including ones re-created
       using the cG-ccA command-line option, see lsme(1)lmme(1)le) will not be effect by the
       setting of these modes. For them to take effect, the buffers should be
       reloaded. These modes can be changed on a per file type basis using
       the command lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le, also some file hooks override these
       global settings, such as the lsmakefile(9)lmmakefile(9)le hook which overrides the cDtabcA
       mode. This indirectly executes lsglobal-mode(2)lmglobal-mode(2)le to set the required
       modes.

    `Auto-Save Time`
    
       Sets the length of time in seconds between buffer auto-saves, a
       setting of cG0cA or an empty string disables auto-saving. The default
       setting is 300 seconds or 5 minutes. This indirectly sets the
       ls$auto-time(5)lmauto-time(5)le variable and the lsautosv(2m)lmautosv(2m)le global mode.

    `Keep Undo`
    
       If this is enabled the lsundo(2)lmundole history is kept after a save allowing the
       lsundo(2)lmundo(2)le command to back-up changes beyond the last save. When clear
       the undo history is discarded after the buffer is saved. This
       indirectly sets bit 0x8000 of the ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le variable.

    `Hide Backups`
    
       Enables hiding MicroEmacs generated backup files. On Windows and Dos
       platforms the Hidden file attribute is used to hide the file, whereas
       on UNIX the backup file name is prepended with a cCcG.cAcA. This indirectly
       sets bit 0x100000 of the ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le variable.

    `Main Menu - Enable`
    
       Enables the top main menu bar.

    `F-Type Buffer Sel`
    
       When enabled the main cDFilecA menu's cDBuffercA selection sub-menu changes
       from being a simple complete list of buffers to being a list of File
       Types (as defined by the cDFile TypescA section below). Selecting one of
       these file types opens a further sub-menu listing all buffers of this
       type; this option is useful when the current session of MicroEmacs has
       a large number of buffers.

    `Alt Action - Esc Prfx`
    
       If enabled the Alt key acts as a lsprefix(2)lmprefix 1le modifier key when no direct
       binding exists. By default cCcGA-ncAcA is not bound, with this bit set the
       key is inferred to cC`esc n`cA which is bound to cDforward-paragraphcA. Note
       that global, local and menu hot-key bindings override these. This
       indirectly sets bit 0x4000 of the ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le variable.

    `Alt Action - Main Menu Hot-keys`
    
       If enabled the main menu Alt hot-key bindings are enabled. These are
       dynamic bindings automatically generated from the main menu. Typically
       the first item in the main menu is cGcGFilecAcA with a hot key of 'cCcCFcAcA', with
       this enabled cCcGA-fcAcA will open this menu item. Note that global and
       local key bindings override these. This indirectly sets bit 0x2000 of
       the ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le variable.

    `Abbrev Setup`
    
       Configures which abbreviation expansion methods are enabled by default
       when the lsexpand-abbrev-handle(3)lmexpand-abbrev-handle(3)le is executed. cDAccentcA enables
       lsexpand-iso-accents(3)lmexpand-iso-accents(3)le, Lookback enables lsexpand-look-back(3)lmexpand-look-back(3)le and Dict'n
       enables lsexpand-word(3)lmexpand-word(3)le.

    `Tab To Indent`
    
       Sets the lstab(2)lmtab(2)le behavior in a buffer which has an lsindent(2)lmindentationle method.
       This indirectly sets bits cG0x1000cA and cG0x200000cA of the ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le
       variable.

    `Show Modes`
    
       Selects which modes are to be displayed on the mode-line whenever a
       cGcG%ecAcA token is used in the ls$mode-line(5)lm$mode-line(5)le variable. This indirectly sets
       the ls$show-modes(5)lm$show-modes(5)le variable.


cEPlatform - UNIX Setup  cA


    Only present on UNIX platforms using the X interface, see below for the
    Console setup.

    cGFontcA
    
       Sets the X font name to be used. This indirectly executes
       lschange-font(2)lmchange-font(2)le with the given font name. e.g.
 
       cG"-*-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-*-*-*-c-90-*"cA

    `Display Char Set`
    
       Selects the display character set being used by the system to render
       the MicroEmacs window, dependent on the cDFontcA being used. The setting
       of this option effects the configuration of MicroEmacs's internal
       character maps (using command lsset-char-mask(2)lmset-char-mask(2)le) enabling the character
       sets of foreign languages to be correctly supported. It also changes
       the definition of variables ls$box-chars(5)lm$box-chars(5)le and ls$window-chars(5)lm$window-chars(5)le to
       their best values for the given font.

    `Extend Char Set`
    
       When enabled MicroEmacs replaces the display of characters cG0x00cA to
       cG0x1fcA with forms which are useful for variables ls$box-chars(5)lm$box-chars(5)le and
       ls$window-chars(5)lm$window-chars(5)le greatly improving the look of lsosd(2)lmosd(2)le dialogs, the
       scroll bars etc.

    `Use Fonts`
    
       When enabled the bold, italic, light and underline characteristics of
       the font will be used depending on their availability and the Color
       Scheme being used. This indirectly sets bit cG0x10cA of the ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le
       variable.

    `Draw White Spaces`
    
       Enables the drawing of visible white spaces, i.e. space, tab and
       new-line characters. This indirectly sets bit cG0x80000cA of the
       ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le variable.

    `Enable Toolbar`
    
       Enables the Toolbar - configurable, managed windows giving easy access
       to many features and tools. When enabled the toolbar is opened and
       displayed at start-up, when disabled the toolbar is not displayed but
       it can be opened (or closed) by simply executing the lstoolbar(3)lmtoolbar(3)le
       command.

    `Client Server`
    
       The client/server enables the file based external macro command driver
       to be enabled - see lsClient-Server(2)lmClient-Serverle. This by default is disabled, when
       enabled it is used by lsme(1)lmcommand-linele options cD-mcA and cD-ocA.

    `DOS File Names`
    
       DOS has a restricted 8.3 file naming system (i.e. cGcGBBBBBBBB.XXXcAcA), if
       this option is enabled the MicroEmacs 2009 will adhere to this system
       for auto-save and backup file names whenever possible. See
       ls$auto-time(5)lm$auto-time(5)le for more information on the naming convention used. This
       indirectly sets bit 0x400 of the ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le variable.

    `# Backups`
    
       This option only has an effect when cDDOS File NamescA is disabled.
       Setting this to a number greater than zero enables multiple backup
       files to be created, the number determined by this value. If set to
       zero (or less) then only a single backup file is created. This
       indirectly sets the ls$kept-versions(5)lm$kept-versions(5)le variable.

    `Ignore Files`
    
       Sets a list extensions of files to be ignored in file completion, e.g.
       MicroEmacs backup files (cG~cA). This indirectly sets the ls$file-ignore(5)lm$file-ignore(5)le
       variable.

    `Cursor Blink Rate`
    
       Sets the cursor blink period in millisecond. The first entry box sets
       the cursor visible time, a setting of zero disables blinking. The
       second box sets the hidden time. A visible time of 600 and hidden time
       of 200 gives a reasonable blink cycle. This indirectly sets the
      ls$cursor-blink(5)lm$cursor-blink(5)le variable.

    `Fence Display`
    
       Sets the preferred method of displaying a matching fence, a fence is
       one of the following brackets:

           {...}   (...)   [...]


       Jumping to the opening fence only occurs when the closing brace is
       typed, whereas the drawing of matching fences occurs whenever the
       cursor is on an open fence or one character past the close fence. When
       this option is set to cG`Never Display`cA the lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le setting is
       ignored.

    `Scroll Bars`
    
       Selects the scroll bar support required. When Splitter is enabled, the
       first character of the scroll bar and mode-line is a split character
       used for splitting the window into two using the mouse. This
       indirectly sets the ls$scroll-bar(5)lm$scroll-bar(5)le variable.

    `Horizontal Scroll`
    
       Selects the horizontal scrolling method used with the lsscroll-left(2)lmscroll-left(2)le
       and lsscroll-right(2)lmscroll-right(2)le commands. This indirectly sets the ls$scroll(5)lm$scroll(5)le
       variable.

    `Vertical Scroll`
    
       Selects the vertical scrolling method used with the lsforward-line(2)lmforward-line(2)le
       and lsbackward-line(2)lmbackward-line(2)le commands. This indirectly sets the ls$scroll(5)lm$scroll(5)le
       variable.

    `Color Scheme`
    
       Sets the color scheme setup macro file name which is executed at
       start-up. MicroEmacs by default comes with 4 color schemes. Color
       schemes can be created and altered using the lsscheme-editor(3)lmscheme-editor(3)le dialog.


cEPlatform - UNIX Console Setup  cA


    Only present on UNIX platforms when using the termcap interface, all the
    Console platform settings are kept independent of the X interface
    settings.

    `Display Char Set`
    
       See cDPlatform UNIX SetupcA above.

    `Termcap Color`
    
       This option determines whether Termcap based colors should be used.
       These are typically the standard eight colors and may not be supported
       on all terminals. If this option is disabled Termcap fonts (such as
       bold) are used instead to create a primitive hi-lighting. This
       indirectly sets bit 0x004 of the ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le variable.

    `Use Fonts`
    
       See cDPlatform UNIX SetupcA above.

cEPlatform - Win32 Setup  cA


    Only present on Microsoft Windows based machines.

    `Font Name`
    
       Sets the windows font name and size. This indirectly executes
      lschange-font(2)lmchange-font(2)le with the given font name. MicroEmacs may only use a
       Fixed Mono Font, either an OEM font as used by the MS-DOS command
       line, or the more conventional ANSI fonts. The fonts are selected
       using the cDChangecA cDFontcA button which invokes a dialog to allow the
       available fonts to be selected. True-Type mono fonts such as Courier
       New or cGLucida ConsolecA are typically used.

    `Weight & Size`
    
       Allows the size and weight of the font to be selected, specified as
       cCweightcA, cCwidthcA and cCheightcA. The cCweightcA is typically 4, this corresponds
       to a regular weighting, 7 is bold. cCwidthcA is the width of the font in
       pixels, this may be 0 when the height is specified as negative. cCheightcA
       is the height of the font, typically a negative value (where the cCwidthcA
       is 0), which produces a proportionally sized font, values of in the
       range -11 .. -14 generally produce reasonably sized fonts. The cChightcA
       and cCwidthcA may be specified as positive values and allow explicit font
       dimensions to be specified, generally used to achieve a precise font
       size requirement.

    `Extend Char Set`
    
       See cDPlatform UNIX SetupcA above.

    `Choose Font`
    
       Opens a windows dialog allowing the user to select a font, the
       selection is used to configure the above font fields.

    `Draw White Spaces`
    
       See cDPlatform UNIX SetupcA above.

    `Capture Alt Space`
    
       Used to enable/disable the capture and interpretation of the cCcGA-spacecAcA
       key sequence. If this key sequence is not captured by MicroEmacs it is
       passed back to Windows which opens the top left window menu, allow
       keyboard access to Window commands like Maximize.

    `Enable Toolbar`
    
       See cDPlatform UNIX SetupcA above.

    `Client Server`
    
       See cDPlatform UNIX SetupcA above. Note that on windows based systems the
       client/server is also used by lsmemsdev(1)lmmemsdev(1)le to drive the editor from the
       Microsoft Developer environment.

    `DOS File Names`
    
       See cDPlatform UNIX SetupcA above. Note that some early version of Windows
       '95 have problems with cG~cA extensions. Service release 2 fixed these
       problems - if you experience problems then return to 8.3 filename mode
       - note that MicroEmacs will still store longer file names, only the
       backup naming convention changes.

    Only present on DOS machines.

    cGGraphic Mode #cA and `Double Lines`
    
       Sets the DOS graphics mode number and whether the number of text lines
       can be doubled. This indirectly executes lschange-font(2)lmchange-font(2)le with the given
       font name.

    `Display Char Set`
    
       See cDPlatform UNIX SetupcA above.

    `Double Lines`
    
       In some graphic modes the number of text lines can be doubled via a

cEMouse  cA


    The mouse device creates keys in a similar way to regular keyboard keys
    and, like keyboard keysm they must be bound before they are used.
    MicroEmacs 2009 does not have the mouse functionality hard coded into the
    editor, it provides a macro interface to the mouse for ultimate
    flexibility and a set of default functionality which can be bound to the
    mouse in a variety of ways.

    All the mouse controlling macros are stored in cGmouse.emfcA and cGmouseosd.emfcA
    although some buffers have local functionality over-rides, such as
    lsfile-browser(3)lmfile-browser(3)le. The user can expand the range of mouse functionality but
    how this is achieved is beyond the scope of this documentation.

    The cDuser-setupcA dialog allows the user to configure the mouse to use the
    default functionality, as follows:-

    `Enable Mouse`
    
       Enables or disables the mouse, when disabled the mouse can not be used
       and will not generate any key events. This does not apply to UNIX
       Termcap systems as the mouse cut and paste operation is performed by
       the Xterm. This indirectly sets bit 0x010 of the ls$mouse(5)lm$mouse(5)le variable.

    `Number Buttons`
    
       Sets the number of buttons on the mouse, may be 1, 2 or 3. MicroEmacs
       usually obtains the correct number for the system, but sometimes this
       can be wrong. This entry can be used to correct this problem. For one
       button mice, the button is considered to be the cGleftcA mouse button, two
       button mice have an cGleftcA and cGrightcA button. This indirectly sets the
      ls$mouse(5)lm$mouse(5)le variable.

    `Swap Buttons`
    
       If enabled then the cGleftcA and cGrightcA buttons are swapped, i.e. when the
       left button is pressed it executes the right button bindings. This
       indirectly sets bit 0x020 of the ls$mouse(5)lm$mouse(5)le variable.

    `Simulate 3 Buttons`
    
       If enabled then pressing the cGleftcA and cGrightcA buttons together with
       generate a middle button press event, this feature is for people with
       a 2 button mouse who want more. The two buttons must be pressed or
       release within 10 millisecond of each other.

    The following four fields determine which mouse button binding the user
    wishes to view and change:-

    cGButtoncA
    
       The mouse button, cGLeftcA, cGRightcA or cGMiddlecA for the normal buttons and
       cGWhell UpcA or cGWhell DowncA for the pilot wheel events.

    `Modifier - Shift`
    
       The action of the mouse can be different for every modifier key
       setting, if this is enabled then the binding being modified is for the
       cDButtoncA being pressed with the cDShiftcA key held down.

    `Modifier - Control`
    
       If enabled then modifying the action when the cDButtoncA is pressed with
       the cDControlcA key held down.

    `Modifier - Alt`
    
       If enabled then modifying the action when the cDButtoncA is pressed with
       the cDAltcA key held down.

    The following two fields determine the functionality of the button defined
    by the previous four fields:-

    `Bound To`
    
       The function to be performed. The functions available depend on the
       type of button being bound, the following is a list of functions
       available for normal buttons:-

       `<not bound>`
    
         The Button is not bound.

       `Drag region`
    
         lsset-mark(2)lmset-mark(2)le is called at the pick location, until the button is
          dropped, the area of text between this point and the current mouse
          position is hi-lighted. When the mouse button is dropped, if the
          drop position is the same as the pick then the double click is
          tested for, if a double click is entered then the Select Word
          function is executed, otherwise the cursor is simply moved to the
          drop position. If the pick and drop position are different then
          the enclosed text is copied to the kill buffer using
          lscopy-region(2)lmcopy-region(2)le. Note this behaviour is altered by the setting of
          MS Shift Region on the Start-Up page.

       `Copy Rectangle`
          One corner of a rectangle is defined on the pick and the
          diagonally opposite corner is defined when the button is dropped,
          the text enclosed within the rectangle is copied to the kill
          buffer using lscopy-rectangle(3)lmcopy-rectangle(3)le.

       `Kill Rectangle`
          The same as Copy Rectangle except the text is killed using
          lskill-rectangle(2)lmkill-rectangle(2)le.

       `Select Word`
          Also executed from a double click bound to Drag Region, Select
          Word copies the word under the mouse into the kill buffer using
          lscopy-region(2)lmcopy-region(2)le, unless a double click is entered in which case the
          whole line is copied.

cEFile Types  cA


    The file type list is used in two places, the main menu's File => Quick
    Open sub-menu list and the cGFile => Open => File TypecA list. In each case
    the file type cG`All Files`cA is automatically added. The user can add, remove
    and change the list of file types by using this dialog. An entry can be
    selected for editing or deletion by simply selecting it with the left
    mouse button. A new entry may be added by simply filling in the 3 entry
    boxes and selecting Add. Items in the Dialog are as follows.

    cGNo.cA
    
       The file type entry number. A new entry is always added to the end of
       the list, ignoring this value. The position of an existing entry can
       be changed by altering this field to the desired position and
       selecting the cGChangecA button to move it to its new position.

    cGNamecA

    cGAddcA
    
       Adds a new entry to the list, only the cDNamecA and cDFileMask ListcA fields
       are used, the cDNo.cA field is ignored as the new entry is always added to
       the end of the list. The position can be altered by using the cDChangecA
       button.

    cGChangecA
    
       Alters an existing file type entry, all 3 fields must be set.

    cGDeletecA
    
       Deletes the current entry number, only the cDNo.cA entry is used.


cETools  cA


    The Tools dialog allows the user to configure up to 10 system commands, or
    tools, which can be executed via MicroEmacs Main Tools Menu. The dialog
    configures the user's registry for the command lsexecute-tool(3)lmexecute-tool(3)le to be used.
    The execution of a tool can also be bound to a key, see cDexecute-toolcA for
    more information.

    The top half of the dialog consists of the 10 Tools (cG0cA-cG9cA) configuration
    buttons. Selecting one of these selects the current tool to be configured,
    the current tool is shown by the title in the middle of the dialog.

    The lower half of the dialog configures the currently selected tool, as
    follows:-

    `Tool Name`
    
       Sets the displayed name of the tool. The tool name is used in the
       buttons in the top half of this dialog and in the MicroEmacs Main
       Tools Menu.

    `Command Line`
    
       Sets the system command-line to be launched whenever the tool is
       executed, the following special tokens may be used in the command-line
       which are substituted at execution:-

       cD%ffcA
    
          The current buffer's full file name, including the path.

       cD%fpcA
    
          The current buffer's file path.

       cD%fncA
     
          The current buffer's file name without the path.

       cD%fbcA

          The current buffer's file base name, i.e. the file name without
           the path or the extension.

       cD%fecA

          The current buffer's file extension with the '.' (e.g. ".emf"),
           set to the empty string if the file name does not have an
           extension.

       Note that "cD%ffcA" is always the same as "cD%fp%fncA" and "cD%fp%fb%fecA". If any
       of these tokens are used, the tool will fail to execute if the current
       buffer does not have a file name.

    `Run Concurrently`
    
       If enabled, when the tool is executed the command is launched and run
       concurrently, allowing the user to continue working in MicroEmacs
       during the tools execution. This option is not available for all
       versions on MicroEmacs and forces the output to be captured. Enabling
       this option will force the use of command lsipipe-shell-command(2)lmipipe-shell-command(2)le to
       launch the tool.

    `Capture Output`
    
       If enabled any output produced from the execution of the tool will be
       captured and inserted into a new buffer. When enabled the following
       two items, cGBuffercA and cGHidecA, may be specified. When disabled the
       command used to execute the tool is lsshell-command(2)lmshell-command(2)le, otherwise the
       command used is either lspipe-shell-command(2)lmpipe-shell-command(2)le or lsipipe-shell-command(2)lmipipe-shell-command(2)le
       depending on the setting of `Run Concurrently`.

    cGBuffercA
    
       Specifies the buffer name the captured output should be dumped to,
       this option is only visible when cGCapture OutputcA is enabled. The
       following special tokens may be used in the buffer name which are
       substituted at execution:-

       cD%fncA
    
         The current buffer's file name without the path, set to the buffer
          name if the current buffer does not have a file name.

       cD%fbcA

         The current buffer's file base name, i.e. the file name without
          the path or the extension. Set to the buffer name if the current
          buffer does not have a file name.

       cD%fecA

         The current buffer's file extension with the '.' (e.g. ".emf"),
          set to the empty string if the current buffer does not have a file
          name or it does not have an extension.

       Note that "cD%fncA" is always the same as "cD%fb%fecA". Default buffer name
       when this field is left empty is "cC*command*cA", or "cC*icommand*cA" if Run
       Concurrently is enabled.

    cGHidecA
    
       When enabled the tool output capture buffer is hidden, this option is
       only visible when cGCapture OutputcA is enabled.

    Current Buffer - cGSavecA and `Prompt Before Saving`
    
       If the current buffer has been edited, enabling `Save Current Buffer`
       will automatically save the current buffer before executing the tool.
       This is particularly useful when the tool operates on the current
       buffer's file (e.g. compiles the file). If cGPromptcA is also enabled the
       user will be prompted before the file is saved.

    All Buffers - cGSavecA and `Prompt Before Saving`
    
       If cGSave All BufferscA is enabled, all edited buffers will be
       automatically saved before executing the tool. This is particularly
       useful when the tool may operate on multiple files (e.g. compilation
       of a project). If cGPromptcA is also enabled the user will be prompted
       before each file is saved.


cEE-Mail  cA


    MicroEmacs 2009 provides a simple E-Mail manager, see lsvm(3)lmvm(3)le for more
    information and example entries. It must be stressed that cDvmcA has only been
    tested in one environment, caution should be used as system differences
    may cause problems, such as loss of data, which the author does not except
    any responsibility for.

    The cDE-Mail SetupcA dialog configures a user to use part or all of the cDvmcA
    E-Mail manager, as follows:-

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    MicroEmacs 2009 provides an integrated spell checker with the following
    features:-

    - Different languages.
    - Dialog control of the speller.
    - Best guess capability.
    - cCReplacecA and cCReplace allcA, cCIgnorecA and cCIgnore AllcA
    - Undo capability.
    - Adding new words and endings to speller.
    - Auto correct of commonly occurring mistakes.
    - Word finder, allows words to be searched with wild cards.

    cDspell-buffercA spell checks the current buffer, from the current position,
    to the end of the buffer. On invocation, an lsosd(2)lmosd(2)le dialog is opened and
    any corrections are made through this interface. If an error dialog opens
    instead the current language is not setup, please see the Language setting
    in lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le and lslocaleSupport(2)lmLocale Supportle.

    The dialog provides the user with an interface from which a new spelling
    may be selected, in addition new words may be added to the spelling
    dictionary. The dialog entries are defined as follows:-

    cDWordcA
    
       The cDwordcA entry contains the erroneous word, this is presented in a
       text dialog box which may be manually edited to correct. If the word
       is manually corrected, then it is spell checked prior to insertion,
       and a new guess list is created. The user may elect to replace the
       word, take one of the suggestions or re-edit the misspelled word.

    cDMeaningcA
    
       The meaning button provides a convenient interface to lsdescribe-word(3)lmdescribe-word(3)le
       for looking up the meaning of the current word. The cDInsertcA button
       within the describe-word dialog will replace the current word in the
       spell-buffer.

    cDSuggestionscA
    
       The suggestions entry contains a list of suggestions as to the correct
       spelling of the word. The list is ranked in order of the best match,
       typically the misspelled word appears at (or near) the top of the
       list, unless the word is unknown or there are gross errors in the
       spelling. Selecting the word in the list with a single click of the
       mouse selects the word as the replacement, the actual replacement is
       performed by the cDReplacecA or cDReplace AllcA buttons. Alternatively, double
       selecting a guess word replaces the word.

    cDLanguagecA
    
       The cDlanguagecA entry allows the user to select the current spelling
       language. The new language is chosen from the dialog box. The language
       may be changed at any time during the spell operation and is effective
       immediately. The cDExtcA languages are extended dictionaries that contain
       additional words, it is recommended that all spelling is performed
       with the extended dictionaries (where available).

    cDReplacecA
    
       The cDreplacecA button is activated when a new word has been edited or
       selected as a candidate for replacement. Selecting cDreplacecA modifies
       the erroneous word in the buffer with the newly selected word.

    cDReplace AllcA
    
       The cDReplace AllcA button is similar to the cDReplacecA button, except that
       it automatically replaces any subsequent occurrences of the erroneous
       word with the newly selected word. The replacement words are retained
       for the MicroEmacs edit session and are lost when the editor is
       closed.

    cDIgnorecA
    
       The cDignorecA button requests that the speller ignore the erroneous word
       and continue to spell the buffer.

    cDIgnore AllcA
    
       The cDIgnore AllcA button is similar to the cDIngorecA button, except that it
       automatically ignores the erroneous word thereafter. The ignore words
       are retained for the MicroEmacs edit session and are lost when the
       editor is closed.

    cDAddcA
    
       cDAddcA adds the current erroneous word to the dictionary, thereafter the
       word is recognized as a valid word. cDAddcA should only be used for words
       which have no derivatives, it is generally better to add a new word
       through the cDEditcA interface where a new cCbasecA word may be specified with
       it's derivatives.

    cDEditcA
    
       The cDEditcA button executes cDspell-edit-wordcA giving the current erroneous
       word. This allows new words and auto-corrections to be defined as well
       as existing words to be altered, see full description below.

    cDFindcA
    
       The cDFindcA button executes cDfind-wordcA giving the current word as a
       starting seed. This allows the user to search for the word using a
       simple search criteria, see full description below.

    cDUndo LastcA
    
       The cDundo LastcA button restores the user to the previous spelling so
       that it may be re-entered, any replacement text that was made is
       restored to it's original spelling.

    cDClosecA
    
       Exits the speller and returns the user to the buffer.

    cDspell-wordcA checks a single word which is either supplied by the user, or
    if an argument is given, the word under (or to the left of) the cursor
    position. If the word is correct, a simple message-line print-out is
    given, otherwise the main spell cDosdcA dialog is opened and the user may
    check the spelling within the context of the spell dialog as described
    above.

    The default key binding of cG`esc $`cA supplies an argument forcing cDspell-wordcA
    to check the current buffer word. cDspell-wordcA is often used to check the
    spelling of a word outside of the context of the editor (i.e. when working
    on paper, or when doing at that prize crossword !!).

    cDspell-edit-wordcA allows words in dictionaries to be altered as well as new
    words and auto-corrections to be defined. On invocation, an cDosdcA dialog is
    opened and changes are made through this interface, defined as follows:-

    cDWordcA
    
       The cDwordcA entry to be changed or added. If cDspell-edit-wordcA was executed
       via spell-buffer cDEditcA button, this will be set to the current word.

    cDNo word setcA
    
       The word entry is empty, most of the functionallity will not be
       available until a word is entered.

    cDNew WordcA
    
       To add a new word, the derivatives of the new word should be selected
       using the prefix and suffix options. Note that not all derivatives are
       listed, only one example derivative of each lsadd-spell-rule(2)lmspell rulele is given.

       cDBE CAREFUL WITH THE CASE OF THE BASE WORD:cA new words that are entered
       are case sensitive, as a general rule the cCwordcA in the cDWordcA text box
       should be edited to it's base form and should be presented in lower
       case characters (unless it is a proper name, in which case it should
       be capitalized, or is an abbreviation or acronym when it might be
       upper case).

       When the appropriate derivatives of the new word have been selected,
       it may be added to the dictionary using the cDAddcA button. This adds the
       word to the users personal dictionary. Please note that if there are
       numerous standard words missing then check that an cCextendedcA dictionary
       (designated by cDExtcA in the language) is being used, the extended
       dictionaries more than double the repertoire of words available.

       Words added to the dictionary may be subsequently removed using the
       cDDeletecA button, typing the existing word in the cDWordcA entry and
       selecting cDDeletecA button removes the existing word.

    cDAuto-CorrectcA
    
       Selection of the cDAuto-CorrectcA button allows a replacement word to be
       entered in the cDTocA text entry. Selecting cDAddcA adds the automatic
       correction to the speller. Thereafter, whenever the erroneous word is
       encountered the replacement word is always used to replace it, without
       user intervention.

       Entering an exiting cCauto-correctcA word into the dialog and selecting
       cDDeletecA removes an existing auto-correct entry.

    cDClosecA
    
       Exits the cDEditcA dialog.

    cDfind-wordcA opens the word finder dialog. This allows the user to search for
    a word using a simple search criteria. (This is ideal for cheating at
    crosswords !!). The word to be searched for is entered into the cDWordcA cDMaskcA
    and may use wild cards cD*cA to represent any number of characters, cD?cA to
    represent an unknown character and cD[cA..cD]cA for a range of characters.

    For example, searching for cGt?e?ecA presents the list cCthemecA, cCtherecA and cCthesecA.
    Searching for cGt*ncA lists all of the words beginning with cGtcA and ending in cGncA.
    See ls$find-words(5)lm$find-words(5)le for a full discription of the format used by search
    engine.

    The words that match are returned in the scrolling dialog, and may be
    selected with the mouse (or cursor keys). The cDInsertcA button inserts the
    selected word into the current buffer or into the cDWordcA entry if executed
    from the cDspell-buffercA dialog. Note that the list presented is limited to
    200 words, selecting cDnextcA gets the next 200 words, and so on. The cDClosecA
    button exits the dialog.

    cDspell-installcA allow the user to install one of the available dictionaries directly
    from within MicroEmacs. The user can interactively select one of the available dictionaries
    from the MicroEmacs message line which is then downloaded directly from the Github project
    if the command line tools cGcurlcA and cGunzipcA are available on the users machine.
    

cENOTES cA


    The words added to the speller during a MicroEmacs session are saved when
    the editor is closed. The user is prompted to save the dictionary, if the
    dictionary is not saved then any words added are lost.

    All cCignorecA words accumulated during a spell session are lost when the
    editor is closed. In order to retain cCignorecA words, it is suggested that
    they are added to the personal dictionary rather than be ignored.

    The personal spelling dictionary is typically called cC<user>cA_<type>_.edf, and
    is stored in the default user location. The dictionary names are specified
    in the lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le dialog.

    cDfind-wordcA may claim to have found more words than are actually listed. The
    use of derivatives in the spell algorithm allows a single word to be
    present several times. cDfind-wordcA counts each occurrence but it is only
    listed once.
    
    cDspell-installcA is a macro implemented in cGspellins.emfcA and was introduced with
    MicroEmacs v091224. It is currently working only on Linux and MacOS if the command
    line tools cGcurlcA and cGunzipcA are installed.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDosd-searchcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDosd-searchcA is a hidden macro which provides a method of searching for text
    patterns within the current buffer and annotating any matches through
    colored line hilighting. A selection of line colors are provided to allow
    different search patterns to be assigned their own color.

    cDosd-searchcA is generally used for annotating log files and alike, where
    indevidual lines are of interest in addition to the context about that
    line. The hilighting draws attention to the line, by providing a visual
    cue, allowing the contents of the file to be breifly scanned.

    On invocation of cDosd-searchcA from the menu cDSearchcA -> cDHilightcA cDSearchcA a
    lsosd(2)lmosd(2)le dialog is presented to the user, search patterns and their
    associated hilighting assignment are selected through this interface. The
    dialog entries are defined as follows:-

    cDSearch forcA
    
       The text dialog entry box allows the search pattern to be entered.
       This may be a regular expression or plain text.

    cDColorcA
    
       The cDColorcA allows the line hilighting color scheme to be selected from
       a pop-up menu. The color cDRemovecA is special and allows previously
       applied line hilighting to be removed.

    cDCase SensitivecA
    
       A check box that allows the search to be case sensitive or
       insensitive. This modifies the lsexact(2m)lmexact(2m)le mode.

    cDMagic ModecA
    
       A check box that enables/disables regular expression pattern matching.
       This modifies the lsmagic(2m)lmmagic(2m)le mode.

    cDBelowcA
    
       Searches and hilights lines matching the search pattern from the

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDscheme-editorcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDscheme-editorcA is a color and font scheme editor that provides a dialog
    interface to configure the display schemes used by the editor. The schemes
    may be created or modified within the scheme editor and then committed to
    the configuration files for general use.

    The editor can be used to create both screen and printer color/font
    schemes, they are typically stored in the cGmacroscA directory and are
    executed as macro files at start up or when printing. The standard screen
    schemes are called cGschemecAcCXcAcG.emfcA and printer ones cGprintcAcCXcAcG.emfcA.

    The cDscheme-editorcA is displayed within a single dialog box, tab selections
    at the top of the dialog box enable cDcolorcA and cDschemecA creation and/or
    modification. Navigation is typically performed using the mouse, where the
    mouse is absent then the cGTABcA key may be used to move between the fields.
    The information presented is defined as follows:-

    cDFile NamecA
    
       The name of the color scheme to be modified. This is the name of the
       cDschemecAcCXcAcD.emfcD file, omitting the file extension. See the cAFILEScA section
       below for a list of standard screen and printer scheme supplied with
       MicroEmacs 2009.

    cDTypecA
    
       Defines whether the scheme is a screen or printer type.

    cDDescriptioncA
    
       An ASCII description of the color scheme, used to identify the color
       scheme.

    cDBuffer HilightcA
    
       Available when scheme is a screen type. Defines whether buffer
       hilighting should be enabled, when cCCompletely DisablecA all buffers are
       displayed character for character in the standard text scheme, this
       will ensure maximum update performance but some file formats such as
       the on-line help will become unreadable so this option is really
       selected. Similarly cCReformat OnlycA disables the majority of buffers,
       hilighting is only enabled when the file would be unreadable without
       it, such as the on-line help or man page files. The default Fully
       Enabled setting enables all buffer hilighting.

    cDPrint OptioncA
    
       Available when scheme is a printer type. Defines what components of a
       scheme is to be used when printing.


cEColors  cA


    The cDcolorscA tab allows the basic palette colors of the editor to be created
    and modified. The left-hand side of the dialog contains a scrolling window
    containing the existing color entries. The right-hand side of the dialog
    provides the controls to add and change the color assignment. The controls
    operate on the currently selected palette entry.

    cDCursorcA
    
       Defines the colour of the text cursor.

    cDShow in DialogscA
    
       Defines whether the cursor should be displayed in the main OSD
       dialogs, this improves usability of the dialogs when limited colors
       are available. Indirectly sets bit cG0x20cA of ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le.

    cDRedcA/cDGreencA/cDBluecA
    
       The color entries allow the currently selected palette color entry to
       be modified. The color values may be changed by direct numeric entry
       (0..255) or via the ^/v controls; the color is committed to the
       palette using the cDAddcA or cDChangecA button.

    cDChangecA
    
       Commits changes to the currently selected color in the palette.

    cDAddcA
    
       Creates and adds a new color entry into the palette. The new palette
       entry is created with a default color that may be subsequently
       modified.


cESchemes  cA


    The cDschemescA tab allows the schemes to be edited. The left-hand side of the
    dialog contains a scrolling window of the available color palette (created
    from the cDColorscA tab). The right-hand side of the window shows the variants
    of the scheme.

    cDSelectioncA
    
       The cDselectioncA item provides a pull-down menu containing gross scheme
       categories used by the editor.

    cDSchemecA
    
       A pull-down menu containing the schemes of the selection, modifying
       this entry shows the variants of the scheme in the cDNormalcA, cDCurrentcA,
       cDSelectcA and cDSel-CurcA dialogs.

    cDResetcA
    
       Resets the current scheme back to the default cCStandard TextcA scheme.

       There are 4 variants, or styles, for a single scheme; each style is
       comprised of a foreground and background color, and a row of toggle button
       to enable/disable fonts, defined as follows.

       cGBcA - Bold.  
       cGIcA - Italic.  
       cGLcA - Light (typically not supported).  
       cGRcA - Reverse video (fore/back-ground swapped).  
       cGUcA - Underline.  
       cGVcA - Toggle reverse video when inverted.  

       The last mode cDVcA needs a little more explanation; commands such as
       lsscreen-poke(2)lmscreen-poke(2)le are able to invert the color scheme, i.e. use the fore
       color for the background etc. Enabling this mode will toggle the reverse
       video mode (cDRcA) when this feature is used.

       The style displayed by a particular scheme depends upon the
       selection/current status of the text:

    cDNormalcA
    
       The normal style, when the text object is not selected or current
       (i.e. out of focus).

    cDCurrentcA
    
       The style used when the text object is current (i.e. in focus)

    cDSelectcA
    
       The style used when the text object is selected (i.e. by the mouse)
       and is not current.

    cDSel-CurcA
    
       The style used when the text object is selected and is current.

       Note that a printer scheme only uses the Normal style.

       Setting of the cDselectioncA and cDschemecA shows the current scheme in the
       cDNormalcA, cDCurrentcA, cDSelectcA and cDSel-CurcA dialogs. New colors are assigned by
       selecting a color in the palette area and making it current. The current
       color is applied by selecting the cDForecA / cDBackcA boxes of the scheme dialog.
       The assigned color is displayed in the text box cCThe big brown fox...cA.


cEControls  cA


    The controls at the bottom of the dialog apply the edits to the
    configuration files.

    cDCurrentcA
    
       Makes the changes to the palette and schemes current, they are applied
       to the current editing session but are not committed to file. This
       allows the palette changes to be used prior to commitment. Note that
       all modifications are lost if they are not saved and the editing
       session is terminated.

    cDSavecA
    
       Saves the scheme modifications to file, effectively making the changes
       permanent. Note however that the scheme macro file will be saved in
       the first directory in the ls$search-path(5)lm$search-path(5)le, regardless of the location
       of the original. For network systems this typically means that the
       changes will only effect the current user.

    cDInstallcA
    
       Installs the current color scheme into the configuration files, making
       the color scheme accessible to the lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le dialog.
       In case you use a BFS execuable where the macro files are read-only files
       as they are  embedded  within the  executable,  you have to write out the
       cGschemes.emfcA    file    manually    by    loading    it    first    from
       cGbfs://macros/schemes.emfcA  and  then  writing  it to your  configuration
       folder, usually cG~/.jasspa/schemes.emfcA.
       
       

    cDExitcA
    
       Quits the scheme editor without modifying the settings.

cENOTES cA


    cDscheme-editorcA is a macro that is implemented in file cGschemosd.emfcA. The
    scheme editor uses lsosd(2)lmosd(2)le to create and manage the dialogs.

    Only the Normal scheme style is used by printer schemes.

    The setting of cDBuffer HilightcA can effect the way buffer hooks are load so
    changing from one scheme to another with differing Buffer Hilight settings
    may not fully work. This can be rectified by restart MicroEmacs with the
    new scheme as default.

    The current screen scheme can effect the printing due to the cDBuffercA
    cDHilightcA setting, e.g. if the screen scheme is set to completely disable
    hilighting then any print-out will also have no hilighting.

    cDMenu LinecA
    
       The cCMenu LinecA appears at the top of the buffer. A left click of the
       mouse on the menu line shows a menu dialog for user selection.

    cDWindowcA
    
       The windows appear at the center of the frame, typically with a scroll
       bar to the right of the window and a cDMode LinecA at the bottom of the
       window. The mouse interactions with the window are defined as
       follows:-

       Left mouse in window - Selecting a region
    
         Regions may be selected with the mouse. Select a position with the
          left mouse, keep the left button pressed move the mouse to the
          desired region end and release the left button. Theregion is
          hilighted, the text is copied the user does not need to perform
          any other selection operation to copy the text.

       Right mouse in window - Pop up Dialog

         A right mouse click in the window brings up a context sensitive
          pop-up menu. A right click on a spelling error, with lsauto-spell(3)lmauto-spell(3)le
          enabled shows a list of possible corrections.

       Right mouse on mode line - Pop up Dialog

         A right mouse click on the Mode Line brings up a pop-up menu to
          control the buffer.

       Left mouse on mode line - split and resize window
     
         If the \| character is selected on the Mode Line then the window is
          split into two horizontally. If the mode line is dragged with the
          mouse then the buffer is re-sized. If the window is dragged into
          another window then the other window is deleted.

       Left mouse on scroll bar - Up/down action
     
         A left click on the scroll bar moves the window up/down. If the =
          component of the scroll bar is selected then the window is split
          into two vertically. Dragging the scroll-bar with the mouse
          horizontally causes the window to be re-sized. Selecting the * in
          the corner of the window allows the window to be resized both
          horizontally and vertically.

       Right mouse on scroll bar - Scroll bar size
          A right click of the mouse on the scroll bar allows the scroll bar
          width to be altered.

      Message Line

         The message line is used from command entry and messages. On entering
          a command such as lsisearch-forward(2)lmisearch-forward(2)le then the user enters text into
          the cDMessage LinecA until the command completes. Messages are also
          displayed in the message line using lsml-write(2)lmml-write(2)le.

      Toolbar

         The toolbar window is displayed if lstoolbar(3)lmtoolbarle mode is enabled in
          lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le. The mouse interaction is a little different from a
          conventional mode line, a mouse right click on the toolbar cDMode LinecA
          allows the tollbar to be configured. A Right click on the cG<cA and cG>cA
          characters of the toolbar mode line moves to the next or previous
          tool.


cEMAIN MENU cA


    The main menu is provided to give an easier access to parts of MicroEmacs
    functionality, the menu is not burnt into MicroEmacs but defined on
    start-up in cGme.emfcA and cGosd.emfcA. The lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le command can be used to
    set whether the menu is always visible and if the Alt-Hotkeys are enabled
    (i.e. cCcGA-fcAcA to open the cDFilecA menu).

    The main menu is lsosd(2)lmosd(2)le dialog number cG0cA so key bindings can be made which
    will open the main menu, an argument of cG0cA will simply open the main menu,
    an argument of cG0x0n0000cA will not only open the main menu but also the cGncAth
    sub menu, e.g. to open the edit menu use:

              0x020000 osd


    Following is a brief description of the main menu items:


cEFile Menu  cA


    cGNewcA
    
       Changes the current buffer to a new buffer.

    cGOpencA
    
       Opens a dialog enabling the user to select files for opening into
       MicroEmacs. By default the dialog opens the selected file using
       command lsfind-file(2)lmfind-file(2)le, but if the view option is selected the
       lsview-file(2)lmview-file(2)le command is used. The binary or encrypt options configure
       whether the files are to be loaded with lsbinary(2m)lmbinary(2m)le or lscrypt(2m)lmcrypt(2m)le modes
       enabled.

    `Quick Open`
    
       Opens a sub-menu list all user file types (defined in lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le).
       Selecting one will open another sub-dialog list all files of that type
       in the current directory, selecting a file will open it using command
       lsfind-file(2)lmfind-file(2)le.

    cGFavoritescA
    
       Opens a sub-menu enabling the user to add new favorite files or macros, edit the
       existing list of favorite files or macros, or select an existing favorite file
       in which case the file is opened using command lsfind-file(2)lmfind-file(2)le. 
       If the line starts with a exclamation mark the text following this exclamation mark
       is executed using the "execute-string" macro. For instance the two lines:

            \Ha help Operating modes
            !help-item "Operating Modes"
            
       would load the appropiate help page. Macros can't be not added like files using the "Add"
       menu entry but must be written manually using the "Edit" menu entry.
       
       The favorite file using to store the list is "__$MENAME__`.eff`" and is saved in
       the first path given in the [$search-path(5)]($search-path(5)). Each favorite file takes
       2 lines in the file, the first is the text displayed in the dialog
       (note that characters '`\`' and '`&`' must be protected with a '`\`' and the
       '`&`' can be used to set the Hot key) and the second line is the file
       name. A line with a single '`-`' character creates a separater line in
       the dialog.

    cGClosecA
    
       Closes the current buffer, executes a dialog form of the command
       lsdelete-buffer(2)lmdelete-buffer(2)le.

    cGAttributescA
    
       Opens a dialog enabling the user to set the current buffers file
       attributes, i.e. read and write permissions. See command
       lsfile-attrib(3)lmfile-attrib(3)le for more information.

    cGSavecA
    
       Saves the current buffer, executes a dialog form of the command
       lssave-buffer(2)lmsave-buffer(2)le.

    `Save As`
    
       Saves the contents of the current buffer as a new file, executes a
       dialog form of the command lswrite-buffer(2)lmwrite-buffer(2)le.

    `Save All`
    
       Saves all changes buffers and session history, executes a dialog form
       of the command lssave-all(3)lmsave-all(3)le.

    `Reread File`
    
       Reloads the contents of the current buffer from the file system,
       discarding any changes, executes lsreread-file(3)lmreread-file(3)le.

    `Print Setup`
    
       Opens a dialog which enables the user to configure the printer driver,
       output location and page layout (executes command lsprint-setup(3)lmprint-setup(3)le).

    cGPrintcA
    
       Prints the contents of the current buffer to the printer, executes
       command lsprint-buffer(2)lmprint-buffer(2)le.

    `File Browser`
    
       Launches the file browser which enables the file system to be
       manipulated and traversed, executes command lsfile-browser(3)lmfile-browser(3)le.

    `FTP Browser`
    
       Launches the FTP browser, an FTP client, executes command lsftp(3)lmftp(3)le.

    `Load Session`
    
       Loads a new session into MicroEmacs, the current session is saved and
       closed and the new session is loaded. The user is prompted from the

    cDosd-helpcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDosd-helpcA provides a GUI front end to the on-line help manual, the dialog
    consists of 3 pages which are defined as follows:-


cEContents  cA


    The contents page displays a list on contents similar to the lshelp(2)lmhelp(2)le high
    level help page. Selecting an item will display the help page in a buffer,
    selecting cDExitcA will exit the dialog.


cEIndex  cA


    The index page gives a list of help items, the cDScopecA menu can be used to
    narrow the index list to the required item type.


cESearch  cA


    The search page provides a way of searching the on-line help for a given
    topic. Similarly to the Index page, the cDScopecA menu is provided to narrow
    the search to the required area.

    The search strings is considered to be made up of items separated by
    spaces, an item can be enclosed in quotes (cCcG"cAcA) so that the item can
    include a space. If the first letter of an item is a cCcG+cAcA the given item
    must be found in a page for it to match, if the character is a cCcG-cAcA the
    item must NOT be found on a page for it to match, or other items are
    considered optional. At least one item must be found on a page for it to
    be a match, the numbers to the right of each found page is the number of
    items found.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDfile-attribcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDfile-attribcA opens a dialog enabling the user to change the system
    properties of the current buffer's file. Top of the dialog give the
    current buffer name and its file name. The cGSave ChangescA button writes the
    current buffer out with any current edits and changes to its file
    attributes. The cGOkcA button closes the file-attrib dialog, any changes made
    to the file attributes will be applied next time the buffer is written.

    The type allow the changing between UNIX, MS Windows and DOS text file
    formats. UNIX has a single new line character (cCcG\ncAcA) where as Windows and
    Dos have a double new line character (cCcG\r\ncAcA). Also a Dos text file is
    terminated with a cGC-zcA (0x1A) character which the other two do not. These
    attribute are set in MicroEmacs by using buffer modes lscr(2m)lmcr(2m)le, lslf(2m)lmlf(2m)le and
    lsctrlz(2m)lmctrlz(2m)le.

    The central part of the dialog contains system dependent attributes which
    are defined as follows:

    cDUNIX PlatformscA
    
       Allow the setting of user, group and global, read, write and execute
       permissions, see man pages on cDchmod(1)cA for more information. This is a
       front end to setting the variable ls$buffer-fmod(5)lm$buffer-fmod(5)le.

    cDWin32 PlatformscA
    
       Allow the setting of MS Windows file attributes, i.e. read-only,

       but cannot be altered. This is a front end to setting the variable
       ls$buffer-fmod(5)lm$buffer-fmod(5)le.

    cDDOS PlatformcA

! 3 describe-word
cEcENAME cEcA


    describe-word - Display a dictionary definition of a word
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDdescribe-wordcA "cCwordcA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDdescribe-wordcA can be used to interface to an external dictionary to get a
    definition of a given word. The interface has two modes of interface, the
    first simply launches an external program which provides the definition in
    its own user interface, e.g. MS Bookshelf. The second interface launches
    an external program which prints out the definition to cGstdoutcA, MicroEmacs
    can then pull out the definition and display it in cDdescribe-wordcA's own
    GUI.

    When executed cDdescribe-wordcA will use the current word under the cursor as
    the initial cCwordcA or will prompt the user if the cursor is not in a word.

    When cDdescribe-wordcA's dialog is used the information presented is defined
    as follows:

    cDWordcA
    
       The word being defined, the entry can be edited and the new word will
       be automatically looked-up when the edit is completed.

    cDInsertcA
    
       The effect of this button is dependent on where describe-word was
       executed. If executed from the cDMeaningcA button within the lsspell-buffer(3)lmspell checkerle
       the Word entry is changed to the current word. When executed outside
       the spell checker the definition of the current word is inserted into
       the current buffer.

    cDExitcA
    
       Closes the dialog.

    Main definition box
    
       Displays the definition of the current word. The user can select a new
       word to describe by clicking the left mouse button on any word within
       the current definition.


cENOTES cA


    cDdescribe-wordcA is a macro implemented in cGword.emfcA.

    Due to the size and availability of dictionaries etc. MicroEmacs is
    released without describe-word set up, the user must setup it up.

    cDdescribe-wordcA must be setup for each required language as follows:

    cD1)cA
 
       A command-line interface to a dictionary of the required language must
       be found. This could simply be a text file containing one word
       definition per line and using cDgrep(1)cA as the command-line interface.
       In this example the text file could take the following form:

              A () The first letter of the English...
              Aam (n.) A Dutch and German measure of liquids...
              Aardvark (n.) An edentate mammal...
              .
              .


       The cDgrepcA command-line interface required to look-up the word
       cGcGaardvarkcAcA would be:

              grep -i "^aardvark (" words.txt


       The output produced from this will be the single line giving the
       required definition. A second common interface would be executing an
       external dictionary program typically using a command-line option to
       specify the word to define, e.g.:

              mydict -d "aardvark"


    cD2)cA
     
       The MicroEmacs language name must be found, this can be done by first
       using lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le or lsspell-buffer(3)lmspell-buffer(3)le to ensure that the current
       language is set the the require one and then running cDdescribe-wordcA.
       The command will probably fail, but before it does it will set the
       variable cG.describe-word.langcA, use the command lsdescribe-variable(2)lmdescribe-variable(2)le to
       get the value of this variable, this value is the internal language
       name. For example, when the current language is cDAmericancA or American
       (Ext) the language name is cGamericancA.

    cD3)cA
    
       To execute the command-line interface the variable
       cG.describe-word.cA_<language>_cG-commandcA must be set to the command-line
       required to obtain a word definition with the string cGcG%scAcA used in
       place of the word and cGcG%%cAcA using in place of a single cGcG%cAcA. For the
       first example in cD(1)cA above the following would be required:

sB
              set-variable .describe-word.american-command ...
                      ... "grep -i \"^%s (\" /tmp/words.txt"

sA       For the second example:

sB
              set-variable .describe-word.american-command "mydict -d \"%s (\""

sA
    cD4)cA

       Only required for the second mode, for use with cDdescribe-wordcA's own
       GUI, the setting of another variable is required, the presence of this
       variable determines which mode is to be used.

       The variable cG.describe-word.cA_<language>_cG-searchcA must be set to a
       lsRegularExpressions(2)lmregex search patternle which will match the required definition(s) in the
       command out put, the first group (cGcG\(...\)cAcA) must enclose the required
       definition, again cGcG%scAcA can be used in place of the word and cGcG%%cAcA for a
       single cGcG%cAcA. cDdescribe-wordcA simply uses lssearch-buffer(2)lmsearch-buffer(2)le repeatedly to
       find all definitions of the current word, it then uses the value of
       the variable ls@s1(4)lm@s1(4)le to get the individual definitions. For example for
       the first example the following is required:

sB
              set-variable .describe-word.american-search  "^\(%s (.*\)\n"

sA
       Note that the word being defined should be kept in the definition if
       possible as the lsadd-spell-rule(2)lmspell rulesle are used to look-up base words when a
       derivitive of a word is not found, therefore the word being defined
       may not be clear (e.g. cCdeactivatecA can be derived from cCactivatecA but
       their meanings are very different). Also long text lines are
       automatically wrapped by the GUI.

    The required variables should be added to the user setup file.

cEcENAME cEcA


    major-mode-setup - Configures the current buffer settings
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDmajor-mode-setupcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDMajor ModecA defines the operational mode of the buffer, controlling
    highlighting and additional commands that are available. The cCMajor ModecA is
    determined by the file type content and is determined from the file
    extension or cCMagic StringcA in the first few lines of the file.

    cDmajor-mode-setupcA provides a dialog interface to configuring the setup of
    the current buffer's file type within MicroEmacs. cDmajor-mode-setupcA may be
    invoked from the main cCToolscA menu or directly from the command line using
    lsexecute-named-command(2)lmexecute-named-command(2)le.

    The changes made to a configuration in cDmajor-mode-setupcA are maintained in
    future MicroEmacs sessions by storing them within the user's setup
    registry file, "cC<logname>cAcG.erfcA". Note that not all file types may be
    supported by cDmajor-mode-setupcA, if not the help menu item will not be
    available.

    The contents of the dialog change, depending on the features the current
    buffer's file type supports. These features are implemented and installed
    within the lsfileHooks(2)lmbuffer's file hookle. The following buttons are always present at
    the bottom of the dialog:

    cGSavecA
    
       Saves the changes made to the configuration back to the users registry
       file, i.e. "cC<Log-Name>cAcG.erfcA" but does not re-initialize the current
       buffer. No changes made will effect the current buffer unless the
       cDCurrentcA button is pressed. Buffers of the same type created after the
       save may inherrit some of the changes.

    cGCurrentcA
    
       Makes the current buffer reflect the changes made, dismissing the
       cDmajor-mode-setupcA dialog. This also performs the above 'cDSavecA'
       operation. Some changes such as dialog creation changes, will only
       take effect when MicroEmacs is restarted.

    cGCancelcA
    
       Quits major-mode-setup, if changes where not cDSavecAd or made cDCurrentcA
       they will be lost.

    Following is a list of configurable features which may be available:

      Create Help Page
 
         Enables/disables the creation of a help page dialog for the tools
          available for the current file type.

      Create Tools Menu
    
         Enables/disables the creation of a file type specific sub menu located
          within the main menu's cDToolscA sub-menu.

      Use Author Mode

         For file types which have an automatic formatter/viewer (currently
          only html) enabling this will simply load the file enabling the source
          code to be viewed and edited. When disabled files of this type will be
          automatically processed giving a more readable 'formatted'
          representation.

      Insert New Template
 
         When creating a new buffer/file of this type, a default template will
          be inserted if this is enabled. When disabled the buffer will remain
          empty.

      Fence Display

         Enables or disables the displaying of matching fences for this file
          type. Note that the way in which the matching fence is display is
          determined by the cDFence DisplaycA option on the Platform page of
          lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le; the major-mode-setup option is ignored if this option
          is set to cG`Never Display`cA.

      Setup Hilighting

         Creates and enables the token lshilight(2)lmhilightingle for the current file type.

      Setup Auto Indent

         Enables automatic formating (indenting) for the current file type. The
          indentation rules are either the built in lsindent(2)lm'C' indentationle or created
          explicitly using the lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le command. When enabled the lstab(2m)lmtab(2m)le is
          still adhered to, but the lsindent(2m)lmindent(2m)le mode is ignored; when disabled
          the indent mode can be used.

      Setup Auto Spell

         Enables the setting up of lsauto-spell(3)lmauto-spell(3)le. When enabled the auto-spell
          key bindings are created and auto-spell is enabled if enabled within
          the user-setup dialog.

      Setup Folding
    
         Enables the setting up of section lscollapse-current(3)lmfoldingle, when enabled the folding
          key bindings are created.

      Add Abbreviations

         Adds the file type's abbreviation file to the buffer using

    printer, the items on this page are defined as follows:-

    cGDrivercA
    
       Sets the printer type to be used, selecting this item creates a drop
       down list of available printer drivers. The drivers inform MicroEmacs
       which fonts and colors are available and how to enable/disable them,
       these are usually special character sequences. The following special
       drivers are defined:-

       Default Plain Text

        This driver does not use any special character sequences so the
         output it produces is plain text. This should work with most
         printers, but it does not support any colors or fonts.

       HTML
     
        This is a virtual printer driver as no printer uses HTML directly.
         However the files produced by this driver can be loaded by a
         web-browser and rendered with full color and font support so
         provides an efficient way of testing printer schemes. In addition
         may be used to convert the text rendered in MicroEmacs into HTML
         content.

       Windows

        This utilizes MicroEmacs's built-in Windows printer interface
         (Windows platforms only). When selected MicroEmacs communicates
         directly to the MS Printer Manager.

    `Print Scheme`
    
       Defines the color and font scheme to be used, selecting this item
       creates a drop down list of available printer schemes - choose the
       most appropriate one for your printer. The cCDefault Plain TextcA scheme
       does not use any color or fonts and should work for all drivers. See
       the next item for scheme creation and editing.

    cGEditcA
    
       Opens the lsscheme-editor(3)lmscheme-editor(3)le dialog box to edit the currently selected
       printer scheme. The editor may be used to create and install new
       printer schemes.

    cGDestinationcA
    
       Specifies the destination print output, when selected a drop down menu
       appears with the following items:

       To buffer only
    
         Creates a "*printer*" buffer and prints to that buffer.

       To file only
    
         Creates a new temporary file and prints to it.

       To file & print

         Prints to a temporary file and then executes the command-line (see
          next item) to print the resultant file. This option is not
          available when using the Windows printer driver.

       Direct to printer

         Output is sent directly to the printer. The option is only
          available when using the Windows driver.

    cGCommand-linecA
    
       Sets the command-line required to print a generated print file (option
       not available when the Windows driver is selected as printing is
       performed directly by the MS Print Manager). The command-line should
       be a single shell command using cGcG%fcAcA to reference the name of the file
       to be printed, e.g. on UNIX systems cDlp(1)cA or cDlpr(1)cA may be used as
       follows:-

              lp -s %f


        On MS-DOS machines this may be performed by copying the file to the
       cGPRNcA device, as follows:

              copy %f PRN


    `Page Layout`

     >  Displays the current page configuration in the form:

              ColumnsxRows Chars-WidexChars-High

     > the fields cannot be edited directly, the settings in __Page Setup__
       affect these values.


cEPage Setup  cA


    `Paper Size`
    
       Defines the size of the printer paper, selecting this item produces a
       pop down menu listing of all available paper sizes. If the the Windows
       printer driver is being used this field cannot be selected and the
       cDEditcA button is used instead.

    `Page Size`
    
       Defines the printable size of the page in terms of the number of
       characters which will fit on the paper (cCwidthcAcDx_cAheight_). When selected a
       drop down menu lists all available sizes for the current paper size.
       This option is not available with the Windows driver and the cDEditcA
       button should be used.

    cGEditcA (Windows only)
    
       Opens a Windows printer dialog box allowing the user to specify the
       windows printer, paper size and character size, etc.

    cGNo. of ColumnscA and cGRowscA
    
       Defines the page subdivision in terms of sub-columns and rows, thereby
       creating sub-pages within a page.

    `Print Line Numbers`
    
       When enabled, prints the line number at the left hand edge of each
       line.

    `Print Split Line IDs`
    
       When enabled the last right hand text column is reserved for a split
       line identifier. Whenever a line is too long to fit on a single line
       it is split over two or more lines, if this option is enabled the
       right edge will be set to the split character (usually a cCcG\cAcA char) to
       clearly indicate that the line is split.

    `Page Layout`
    
       As with the cDPrintercA cDPage LayoutcA, displays the current page
       configuration, the field cannot be edited.


cELayout  cA


    cGMarginscA
    
       Configures the top, bottom, left and right margins of the page in
       terms of characters.

    `Print Header`
    
       Defines whether a header should be printed and its format. The
       following escape sequence is interpreted:

       cG%%cA
              Print a '%' character.

       cG%bcA
              Print the current buffer's name.

       cG%DcA
              Print the current day of the month.

       cG%fcA
              Print the current buffer's file name.

       cG%hcA
              Print the current hour.

       cG%McA
              Print the current month of the year.

       cG%mcA
              Print the current minute of the hour.

       cG%pcA
              Print the current page number.

       cG%scA
              Print the current seconds.

       cG%YcA
              Print the current year as a 2 digit number.

       cG%ycA
              Print the current year as a 4 digit number.

    `Print Footer`
    
       Defines whether a footer should be printed at the end of the page and
       the format. The header escape sequence characters are used.


cENOTES cA


    cDprint-setupcA is a macro using lsosd(2)lmosd(2)le, defined in cGprintstp.emfcA.

    The list of available printer drivers and print schemes is stored in the
    macro file cGprinters.emfcA. To create a new printer driver a new
    configuration registry file (cGerfcA file - see cGprint*.erfcA for examples) must
    be created and added to the printer driver lists within cGprinter.emfcA.

    The cGprinters.emfcA file also contains a list of printing schemes, using the
    cDInstallcA option of the lsscheme-editor(3)lmscheme-editor(3)le. lsscheme-editor(3)lmscheme-editor(3)le automatically
    adds the new scheme to the print schemes list.

    line-scheme - Apply line annotation in current buffer
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cCncA cDline-schemecA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDline-schemecA applies or removes line hilighting by assignment of the buffer
    line variable ls$line-scheme(5)lm$line-scheme(5)le. The numerical argument cCncA is the line scheme
    number to apply to the line or region when omitted (or specified as 1)
    then any line hilighting is removed.

    If a region is defined then the command operates as follows:-

    Region contained on a single line
    
       When the region is contained on a single line then this is assumed to
       be a search string and all lines in the buffer that match the region
       text are hilighted with the color scheme cCncA.

    Region spans multiple lines
    
       When the region spans multiple lines then all of the lines of the
       region are hilighted with the color scheme cCncA.

    cDline-schemecA is typically invoked from the pop-up menu (mouse right) to
    apply line hilighting annotation to a line or region. The user may select
    to apply a region hilight, remove the region hilight, remove all
    hilighting or perform a search using lsosd-search(3)lmosd-search(3)le.

! 3 buffer-setup
cEcENAME cEcA


    buffer-setup - Configure the current buffer settings
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDbuffer-setupcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDbuffer-setupcA provides a dialog interface for configuring the buffer major
    mode, indentation and buffer modes. cDbuffer-setupcA may be invoked from the
    main cCToolscA menu or directly from the command line using
    lsexecute-named-command(2)lmexecute-named-command(2)le.

    The cDbuffer-setupcA dialog may be used to quickly reconfigure the attributes
    of a given buffer. The settings are only temporary and expire once the
    buffer has been closed or re-loaded. lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le should be used to
    associate user specific settings with different buffer types.

    The following controls are available:-

    cDMajor ModecA
    
       Associates a file type with the content of the file and is used to
       modify the buffer highlighting and content assisted controls if the
       file type has not been recognized correctly. Changing the major mode
       will cause the new file type template to be loaded and may cause the
       buffer key bindings to change. The default major mode settings are set
       with lsmajor-mode-setup(3)lmmajor-mode-setup(3)le.

    cDIndent WidthcA
    
       Defines the indent width to use when the TAB key is pressed, or
       following a nested construct in a auto-indent buffer. This entry
       modifies the ls$buffer-indent-width(5)lm$buffer-indent-width(5)le setting. The default indentation
       width is defined by the variable ls$indent-width(5)lm$indent-width(5)le.

    cDTab WidthcA
    
       The width of a rendered TAB character in spaces, modification of this
       value immediately changes the layout. This modifies the buffer width
       tab variable ls$buffer-tab-width(5)lm$buffer-tab-width(5)le the default is 8 (defined by
       ls$tab-width(5)lm$tab-width(5)le). Where files have been edited with a non-standard tab
       width then modification of this value (to typically 2 or 4) may
       correct the problem. To correct the styling of the buffer to be editor
       independent then the command lstabs-to-spaces(3)lmtabs-to-spaces(3)le may be used to change
       all of the tab characters to spaces once the tab width has been
       correctly set.

    cDFill ColumncA
    
       A text layout variable, defines the maximum length of the line before
       wrapping occurs when a text paragraph is filled. This modifies the
       buffer fill column variable ls$buffer-fill-col(5)lm$buffer-fill-col(5)le the default is 78
       (defined by ls$fill-col(5)lm$fill-col(5)le).

    cDFill ModecA
    
       A text layout variable, defines how paragraphs should be filled across
       multiple lines. This modifies the buffer fill mode variable
       ls$buffer-fill-mode(5)lm$buffer-fill-mode(5)le the default is B which causes automatic detection
       of paragraph layout, defaulting to full justification against the left
       and right margins (defined by ls$fill-mode(5)lm$fill-mode(5)le).

    cDUse Auto IndentationcA
    
       Toggles automatic indentation on an off, this setting is only present
       if the buffer type supports a lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le scheme. Typically used for
       files such as lsc(9)lmlexle and lsc(9)lmyaccle which use a special syntax combination with
       C.

    cDUse HilightingcA
    
       Toggles hilighting on and off, this setting is only present if the
       buffer type supports a lshilight(2)lmhilight(2)le scheme.

    cDBuffer ModescA
    
       The modes of the buffer, refer to lsOperating ModeslmOperating Modesle for more
       information.

       A notable mode switch here is lstab(2m)lmtab(2m)le which changes the behavior of
       the cGTABcA key, when set tabs are simulated with the insertion of spaces,
       when disabled literal tab characters are used.


cEHISTORY cA


    Prior to the 2006 release cDbuffer-setupcA was previously called cDindent-setupcA
    and dealt with the indentation settings only. The 2006 release introduced
    the concept of cDMajor ModecA.

$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDfile-type-setupcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDfile-type-setupcA provides a dialog interface for declaring a set of common
    files type categories and their associated file extensions. The file
    categories are used to determine the common file types in the File main
    menu cDQuick OpencA.

    cDfile-type-setupcA may be invoked directly from the command line or more
    usually from the miscellaneous configuration item cDFile TypescA in
    lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le.

    On invocation a generic name for the file class is assigned to a set of
    file names or extensions as a comma separated list i.e. cG*.a,*.b,*.ccA.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDalias-path-setupcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDalias-path-setupcA provides a dialog interface for declaring alternative
    alias paths. Alias path is a short name, conventionally then cG~cA is the home
    directory. The alias path setup allows other directory paths to be bound
    to a name i.e. "cDmecA" may be associated with "cD/home/jon/merep/me/cA". Given
    the alias definition then cD~mecA expands to cD/home/jon/merep/me/cA.

    cDalias-path-setupcA is accessible from the lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le cDMiscellaneouscA tab.

    Multiple aliases may be defined and they are automatically accessible from
    the mode line when a file or directory name is entered.

cEcENAME cEcA


    file-tool-setup - Define file-browser tools
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cDfile-tool-setupcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDfile-tool-setupcA provides a dialog interface for declaring a set of actions
    to act on files shown in the lsfile-browser(3)lmfile-browser(3)le directory listing. Actions
    may be defined to interact with cGZIPcA files for both creation and
    extraction, opening of cGPDFcA files with Adobe Acrobat, opening of Microsoft
    Word cGDOCcA files with Word or StarOffice etc. These options are shown in the
    cDfile-browsercA pop-up menu under cDToolscA.

    The file tools may be configured from lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le in the cDMiscellaneouscA
    tab or invoked directly from the command line using cDfile-tool-setupcA, when
    invoked then the File Tool Setup dialog is displayed. The dialog allows
    commands to be be matched against certain file types that are determined
    using a regular expression, if a filename matches the pattern then a
    command line or MicroEmacs command may be invoked to process the file(s).
    The command line includes cCvariablescA which are filled in by MicroEmacs. The
    information is stored in the registry cCuser.erfcA and is retained across
    sessions.

    The cDfile-tool-setupcA presents a list of tools, there is no limit to the
    number of tools which can be defined or to the number of tools that may
    map to a specific file type. The dialog has the following fields:

    cDName cA
    
       Declares the name of the tool as it appears in the cDToolscA section of
       the lsfile-browser(3)lmfile-browser(3)le pop-up menu. A single menu short-cut key may be
       defined by prefixing the hot key with a cG\HcA.

    cDFile Mask cA
    
       A regular expression that is used to search for files of a given type,
       this follows the standard MicroEmacs lsRegularExpressions(2)lmRegular Expressionle syntax. As an
       example 'all files' is defined as cGcG.*cAcA, PDF files are defined as
       cG.*\.pdfcA, image files might be defined as a set of different extensions
       cG.*\.\(png\|jpg\|jpeg\|bmp\|gif\)cA, etc.

    cDCommand cA
    
       Defines the command line or MicroEmacs command that is executed to
       process the action. The command line comprises escape characters using
       the percentage (cG%cA) character, these fields are filled in automatically
       by MicroEmacs and are defined as follows:

       cD%fcA - Filename
    
        A replacement for the filename, typically passed in quotes to the
         command being executed as an argument. The filename is defined as
         a relative pathname from the current directory location. If
         multiple files are selected in the file-browser then the command
         line is executed multiple times, once for each file, unless the %*
         construct is used in conjunction with %f when multiple files may
         be specified with a single command invocation.

       cD%bcA - Base Filename
     
        The basename of the file, i.e. no pathname and no file extension.

       cD%ecA - File Extension
     
        The file extension of the filename.

       cD%pcA, cD%PcA - File pathname

        The pathname of the file without the filename. %p is the file path
         with '/' forward slash directory separators. %P is the same as %p
         but with '\' backslashes directory separators on Microsoft Windows
         and DOS.

       cD%i[cAcChcAcD|cBpromptcA|cBdefaultcA]cD .. cA%ncA - User Input

        Specifies that the user is to be prompted for input from the
         command line. Square brackets follow the %i which defines the
         command line prompt. The %i[..] is replaced with the user input
         and may be replicated in the command line using %n where n is a
         digit 1..9 where %1 reproduces the first %i, %2 reproduces the
         second, ... etc.

        h specifies the type of data to be entered including the history
         and semantics allowed. h may have the following values:

              0 For a general string input using the general history.
              1 For an absolute file name, with completion and history.
              2 For a MicroEmacs buffer name, with completion and history.
              3 For a MicroEmacs command name, with completion and history.
              4 For a file name, with completion and history.
              5 For a search string, with history.
              6 For a MicroEmacs mode name, with completion and history.
              7 For a MicroEmacs variable name, with completion and history.
              8 For a general string using no history.
              9 For a user supplied completion list (com-list).
              a For a user supplied completion list (buffer-name).

     > >  prompt is the prompt string presented on the command line.

     > >  default is the default value that should be used. The % characters
          may be used and will be replaced with information from the
          filename e.g. %b would be replaced with the base file name.

     > >  As an example of the user input, consider the following command
          line which is used to unzip a .zip file:

              unzip "%f" -d %i[4|Unzip sub-dir|%b]

         Given an input file of /home/user/foo.zip then the command line
          unzip "/home/user/foo.zip" -d foo is generated, given that the
          user accepted the defualt command line prompt of "foo" for the
          prompt "Unzip sub-dir"

         Where the user input is required in multiple parts of the command
          line then the %1 syntax may be used. The following example may be
          used to create a .zip archive from one or more selections in the
          file list.

              rm -f "%i[4|Zip file name|%b].zip"; zip -r %1.zip%*[ "%f"]

         In this instance the user is prompted for the Zip file name and it
          is used twice in the command line, the default name is the base
          file name of the first file. Consider two files have been selected
          foo.txt and bar.txt where foo.txt is first. The generated command
          line is:

              rm -f "foo.zip"; zip -r foo.zip "foo.txt" "bar.txt"

         Note how the basename has been used as the default for the zip
          file name to create and this has been used in two places in the
          command line, once to delete the old archive if it already exists
          and once to form the new archive.

       cD%*[cA_argumentcC_cA]__ - Multiple file command line
     
         Utilities that accept multiple arguments on the command line use a
          special construct %*. By default a single command line invocation
          is made for each file, the %* construct makes a single command
          line invocation for multiple files.

         The square bracket construct contains the expansion for each file
          specified in the file-browser, this will typically include the %f
          construct. For each argument then the brackets are expanded and
          concatenated together to form a command line, as such the bracket
          construct usually starts with a space character as this separates
          the files.

         As an example then zip file construction will take multiple files
          on the command line to add to the archive:

              rm -f "%i[4|Zip file name|%b].zip"; zip -r %1.zip%*[ "%f"]

        cD%"cA_...cD_%"cA - Quote text
    
         Using quote tags ensures the quoted part of the command-line is
          treated as a single argument. For example, if the tool:

              unzip %f

         is used for the file "Test Files.zip" the command-line becomes
          'unzip Test Files.zip' which will not work correctly, conversely
          using "%f" will not work for files with quotes (e.g.
          '2"bolt.def'). However, if

              unzip %"%f%"

         is used MicroEmacs works out the best way to quote the file name
          for it to be properly processed.

        cD*cAcCMicroEmacs-CommandcA - Internal command

         Where the command commences with a star character (*) then the
          command is treated as a MicroEmacs command and is executed within
          the editor. As an example consider handling a zip file using the
          lsfind-zfile(3)lmfind-zfile(3)le command:

              *find-zfile "%f"

         For each file then find-zfile is invoked to read the zip archive.

    cDDefault Open cA
    
       A flag that defines whether this is the default open action. When set
       then the command is automatically launched if the file is opened in
       the cDfile-browsercA (usually by left clicking on the file name or
       pressing cGcGreturncAcA) . When clear then the tool has to be explicitly
       invoked.

    cDHide Window cA
    
       Defines the visibility of the window associated with the command, for
       example, if the command-line uses a cGcmdcA shell to launch another
       process the cmd window should be hidden. This has no effect on
       internal MicroEmacs commands.

    cDUp/Down cA
    
       Changes the item order in the list/menu by moving it up or down.

    cDAdd cA
    
       Adds a new tool line to the list.

    cDModify cA
    
       Modifies the existing tool setting.

    cDDelete cA
    
       Deletes the tool from the list.

    cDClose cA
    
       Closes the tool menu.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD&repcA cCstr1cA cCstr2cA cCstr3cA  
    cD&irepcA cCstr1cA cCstr2cA cCstr3cA

    cD&xirepcA cCstr1cA cCstr2cA cCstr3cA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    These functions search for cCstr2cA in cCstr1cA, replacing it with cCstr3cA, returning
    the resultant string.

    The functions may all be abbreviated to their three letter abbreviation
    (i.e. cD&xirepcA may be expressed as cD&xircA). In all cases the first argument is
    completely evaluated before the second and third arguments.

    cD&repcA cCstringcA cCsearchcA cCreplacecA
    
       Searches for the cCsearchcA string in the given cCstringcA using a simple case
       sensitive exact match algorithm. Any occurrences are removed from
       cCstringcA and cCreplacecA is inserted in its place. Either of the 3 input
       strings can be the empty string (cG""cA).

    cD&irepcA cCstringcA cCsearchcA cCreplacecA
    
       cD&irepcA is identical to cD&repcA except a case insensitive search algorithm
       is used.

    cD&xrepcA cCstringcA cCregex-searchcC cAregex-replacecA
    
       cD&xrepcA can be used to access the more powerful regular expression
       searching capabilities. The function is similar to cD&repcA except it
       takes a regex search string and the replacement string may also refer
       to all or part of the matched string. See lsRegularExpressions(2)lmRegular Expressionsle for
       information on the cCregexcA format.

    cD&xirepcA cCstringcA cCregex-searchcC cAregex-replacecA
    
       cD&xirepcA is identical to cD&xrepcA except a case insensitive regex search is
       used.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example turns a UNIX format file name (using a cCcG/cAcA to divide
    directories - like MicroEmacs) into an windows format name (using a cCcG\cAcA):

sB
          set-variable #l0 &rep #l0 "/" "\\"

sA
    The following example replaces one or more white spaces in the variable
    with a single space, this is an easy way to remove unnecessary spaces:

sB
          set-variable #l0 "This   is   not   so    spacey    after   xrep"
          set-variable #l0 &xrep #l0 "\\s +" " "

    cD&pdeccA cCvariablecA cCdecrementcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The numeric operators operate on variables or integers to perform integer
    computations, returning the integer result of the operation. The contents
    of the variables are interpreted as signed integers typically with a
    dynamic range of 2^31 <= cCnumcA <= 2^31-1.

    The operators may all be abbreviated to their three letter abbreviation
    (i.e. cD&multiplycA may be expressed as cD&mulcA). In all cases the first argument
    is completely evaluated before the second argument.

    cD&abscA cCnum1cA
    
       Returns the absolute value of cCnum1cA i.e. if cCnum1cA is positive it returns
       cCnum1cA, else -cCnum1cA

    cD&addcA cCnum1cA cCnum2cA
    
       Addition of two numbers cCnum1cA and cCnum2cA. i.e. cCnum1cA + cCnum2cA

    cD&subcA cCnum1cA cCnum2cA
    
       Subtract the second number cCnum2cA from the first cCnum1cA i.e. cCnum1cA - cCnum2cA.

    cD&multiplycA cCnum1cA cCnum2cA
    
       (Signed) Multiply cCnum1cA by cCnum2cA. i.e. cCnum1cA * cCnum2cA. cD&mulcA is the three
       letter abbreviation.

    cD&divcA cCnum1cA cCnum2cA
    
       Divide the first number cCnum1cA by the second cCnum2cA, returning the integer
       result. i.e. cCnum1cA / cCnum2cA. cD&divcA is the three letter abbreviation.

    cD&modcA cCnum1cA cCnum2cA
    
       Divide the first number cCnum1cA by the second cCnum2cA, returning the integer
       remainder. i.e. cCnum1cA % cCnum2cA.

    cD&negatecA cCnumcA
    
       Negate the integer (multiply by -1) i.e. -cCnumcA. cD&negcA is the three
       letter abbreviation.

    Expression evaluation is prefix. Operators may be nested using a pre-fix
    ordering, there is no concept of brackets (in-fix notation). The
    expression cG(2 * 3) + 4cA is expressed as:-

sB
          &add &mul 2 3 4

sA
    conversely cG2 * (3 + 4)cA is expressed as:-

sB
          &mul 2 &add 3 4

sA
    The pre/post incrementing and decrementing operators provide a mechanism
    for stepping through indexed information without incurring the overhead of
    providing multiple statements to perform assignment operations. The
    cCvariablecA argument MUST be the name of a variable, it cannot be an
    expression or an indirection. The cCincrementcA may be any integer expression
    (including another auto (dec)increment). Note that cCvariablecA is re-assigned
    with it's new value within the operator, therefore use with care when
    performing multiple (dec)increments within the same statement line. The
    four operators are defined as follows:

    cD&inccA cCvariablecA cCincrementcA
    
       Pre-increment the cCvariablecA by cCincrementcA, returning the incremented
       value i.e. cCvariablecA += cCincrementcA.

    cD&deccA cCvariablecA cCdecrementcA
    
       Pre-decrement the cCvariablecA by cCdecrementcA, returning the decrement value
       i.e. cCvariablecA -= cCdecrementcA.

    cD&pinccA cCvariablecA cCincrementcA
    
       Post-increment the cCvariablecA by cCincrementcA, returning the pre-increment
       value i.e. cCvariablecA++., where the ++ value is determined by cCincrementcA.
       The return value is the value of cCvariablecA as passed by the caller, the
       next reference to cCvariablecA uses the cCvariablecA+cCincrementcA value.

    cD&pdeccA cCvariablecA cCdecrementcA
    
       Post-decrement the cCvariablecA by cCdecrementcA, returning the pre-decrement
       value i.e. cCvariablecA--, where the -- value is determined by cCdecrementcA.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    Add two numbers together and assign to a variable:-

sB
          set-variable %result &add %num1 %num2

sA
    Increment cG%resultcA by 1 and add to cG%result2cA

sB
          set-variable %result  &add %result 1
          set-variable %result2 &add %result2 %result

sA
    The previous example could have used the increment operators to achieve
    the same result in a single operation e.g.

sB
          set-variable %result2 &add %result2 &inc %result 1

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The string operators operate on character strings (cD%cA or cD$cA variables),
    performing general string manipulation, returning a string result.

    The operators may all be abbreviated to their three letter abbreviation
    (i.e. cD&rightcA may be expressed as cD&rigcA). In all cases the first argument is
    completely evaluated before the second argument.

    cD&catcA cCstr1cA cCstr2cA
    
       Concatenate two string cCstr1cA with cCstr2cA to form a new string. i.e.
       cCstr1str2cA

    cD&lefcA cCstrcA cClencA
    
       Return cClencA leftmost characters from cCstrcA. If cCstrcA length is shorter than
       cClencA then the string itself is returned. A cClencA of zero returns the
       empty string. A negative cClencA returns all but the 0-cClencA rightmost
       characters from cCstrcA.

    cD&rigcA cCstrcA cCindexcA
    
       Returns the rightmost characters of string cCstrcA from index cCindexcA. This
       function causes some confusion, consider cD&lefcA and cD&rigcA to be the
       string equivalents of their integer counterparts ls&abs(4)lm&divle and ls&abs(4)lm&modle; cD&rigcA
       returns the remainder of the equivalent cD&lefcA function. Invocation with
       cCindexcA set to zero returns cCstrcA. A negative cCindexcA returns the 0-cCindexcA
       rightmost characters from cCstrcA.

    cD&midcA cCstrcA cCindexcA cClencA
    
       Extracts a sub-string from string cCstrcA, starting at position cCindexcA of
       length cClencA. A negative cCindexcA extracts the string starting from 0-cCindexcA
       from the end of cCstrcA with a length of cClencA.

    cD&lencA cCstrcA
    
       Returns the integer length of the string (number of characters).

    cD&slowercA cCstrcA
    
       Returns the given string with all upper case characters converted to
       lower case.

    cD&suppercA cCstrcA
    
       Returns the given string with all lower case characters converted to
       upper case.

    cD&trbothcA cCstrcA
    
       Returns the given string trimmed of white spaces (i.e. cC` `cA, cCcG\tcAcA,
       cCcG\rcAcA, cCcG\ncAcA, cCcG\ClcAcA and cCcG\CkcAcA) from both sides of the string.

    cD&trleftcA cCstrcA
    
       Returns the given string trimmed of white spaces from the left side of
       the string only.

    cD&trrightcA cCstrcA
    
       Returns the given string trimmed of white spaces from the right side,
       or end, of the string only.

    Evaluation of the strings is left to right, the leftmost argument is fully
    evaluated before the next argument. The operator ordering is prefix
    notation (see ls&add(4)lm&add(4)le for an example of prefix ordering).


cEEXAMPLE cA


    Concatenate two strings cGabccA and cGdefcA together:-

sB
          set-variable %result &cat "abc" "def"

sA
    To concatenate three strings cGabccA, cGdefcA cGghicA together:

sB
          set-variable %result &cat "abc" &cat "def" "ghi"

sA
    or, a slightly different ordering:

sB
          set-variable %result &cat &cat "abc" "def" "ghi"

sA    Retrieve the leftmost character of a string variable, modify the variable
    to contain the remainder.

sB
          set-variable %foo "abcdef"
          set-variable %c   &lef %foo 1
          set-variable %foo &rig %foo 1

sA
    Where cG%ccA = cGcGacAcA; cG%foocA = cGcGbcdefcAcA following evaluation.

    To retrieve the characters cGcdecA into variable cG%resultcA from the string
    cGcGabcdefcAcA use:

sB
          set-variable %result &mid "abcdef" 2 3

sA 
    To retrieve the rightmost character from the string:

sB
          set-variable %foo "abcdef"
          ; using negative argument

    The original cDMicroEMACScA "cD&rigcA cCstrcA cCncA" function returns the last cCncA
    characters from the string cCstrcA this differs from the definition of cD&rigcA in
    this implementation. As most string decomposition is performed left to
    right, and to make cD&lefcA and cD&rigcA complement each other, the indexing of
    the function has been modified.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The logical testing operators perform comparison tests, returning a
    boolean value of cGTRUEcA (1) or cGFALSEcA (0).

    The functions may all be abbreviated to their three letter abbreviation
    (i.e. cD&greatcA may be expressed as cD&grecA). In all cases the first argument is
    completely evaluated before the second argument. Logical operators
    include:-

    cD&and cAcClog1cA cClog2cA
    
       cGTRUEcA if the logical arguments cClog1cA and cClog2cA are both cGTRUEcA.

    cD&orcA cClog1cA cClog2cA
    
       cGTRUEcA if either one of the logical arguments cClog1cA and cClog2cA are cGTRUEcA.

    cD&notcA cClogcA
    
       Logical NOT. Returns the opposite logical value to cClogcA.

    The numerical logical functions operate with integer arguments:

    cD&equalcA cCnum1cA cCnum2cA
    
       cGTRUEcA. If numerical arguments cCnum1cA and cCnum2cA numerically equal.
       Abbreviated form of the function is cD&equcA.

    cD&greatcA cCnum1cA cCnum2cA
    
       cGTRUEcA. If numerical argument cCnum1cA is greater than cCnum2cA. Abbreviated
       form of the function is cD&grecA.

    cD&lesscA cCnum1cA cCnum2cA
    
       cGTRUEcA. If numerical argument cCnum1cA is less than cCnum2cA Abbreviated form of
       the function is cD&lescA.

    Evaluation of the logical operators are left to right, the leftmost
    argument is fully evaluated before the next argument. The operator
    ordering is prefix notation (see ls&add(4)lm&add(4)le for an example of prefix
    ordering).


cEEXAMPLE cA


    Test for integers in the range greater than 12:

sB
          !if &great %i 12
              ...

sA
    Test for integers in the range 8-12, inclusive

sB
          !if &and &great 7 &less 13
              ...

sA
cENOTES cA


    MicroEmacs always evaluates all arguments operators BEFORE the result is
    obtained, this differs from most programming languages. Consider the
    following example:

sB
          !if &and &bmod "edit" &iseq @mc1 "Save buffer first [y/n]? " "nNyY" "y"
              save-buffer
          !endif

sA
    This would not not work as the user may expect, the user would be prompted
    to save every time regardless of whether the buffer has been changed.
    Instead the following should be used:

sB
          !if &bmod "edit"
              !if &iseq @mc1 "Save buffer first [y/n]? " "nNyY" "y"
                  save-buffer

    &sprintf - Formatted string construction


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD&sprintfcA cCformatcA cCargscA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cD&sprintfcA function (or cD&sprcA in it's abbreviated form) provides a
    mechanism to generated a formatted string, similar to the 'C' programming
    language cDsprintf(2)cA function. 

    The cD&sprintfcA function is generally used where a number of different
    sources of information have to be converted and joined together to form a
    new string. It is possible to do this using ls&cat(4)lm&cat(4)le, but it does become
    complicated if the number of strings to be spliced together is greater
    than about 4, cDsprintfcA alleviates these problems and results in faster
    execution. Where only two, or three strings are to be concatenated cD&catcA
    provides better execution times.

    The cD&sprintfcA function produces a string construct for the cCformatcA and a
    caller determined number of arguments cCargscA (variable arguments). The
    cCformatcA string may contain special 'cCcC%cAcA' formatting commands to insert
    strings and numbers into the base cCformatcA string. The format for the 'cCcC%cAcA'
    commands is "cD%nccA" where:-

    cDncA
    
       An optional numerical argument, the interpretation of the numeric
       value is determined by the following command (cDccA).

    cDccA
    
       The command determines the interpretation of the next argument cCargcA
       which are specified as follows:

        cDdcA (Decimal integer)
              Expects a single numeric argument arg which is inserted into the
              format string as decimal text string. If n is specified then the
              inserted text string is fixed to n character in length.

        cDncA (Repeat String)
              Expects two arguments arg, the first is a numeric argument giving
              the number of times to insert the given string (the second
              argument). If n is specified then the string is inserted n *
              numeric-argument times.

        cDscA (String)
              Expects a single argument arg which is a string to be inserted
              into the key. If n is given then it is insertedn times.

        cDxcA (Hexadecimal integer)
              Expects a single numeric argument arg which is inserted into the
              format string as hexadecimal text string. If n is given then the
              inserted text string will be fixed to n character in length.

        cD%cA
              Inserts a single '%', n has no effect.

    The cD&sprintfcA function may be nested (i.e. a string argument to
    cD&sprintfcA may be the result of another cD&sprintfcA invocation). Although
    this type of construct is not generally required !!


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following examples show how the command may be used:-

sB
          set-variable %result &sprintf "Foo [%s%s]" "a" "b"

sA
    generates cG`Foo [ab]`cA

sB
          set-variable %result &sprintf "Foo [%n%s]" 10 "a" "b"

sA
    generates cG`Foo [aaaaaaaaaab]`cA.

sB
          set-variable %result &sprintf "[%d] [%3d] [%x] [%3x]" 10 11 12 13

sA
    generates cG`[10] [ 11] [c] [  d]`cA


cENOTES cA


    It is the callers responsibility to ensure that the correct number of
    arguments is supplied to match the requested formatting string. The
    results are undefined if an incorrect number of arguments are supplied.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    These are a selection of miscellaneous functions providing tests and
    exchanging of information.

    The functions may all be abbreviated to their three letter abbreviation
    (i.e. cD&indirectcA may be expressed as cD&indcA). In all cases the first argument
    is completely evaluated before the second argument.

    cD&atoicA cCcharcA
    
       Converts the given character cCcharcA to it's ASCII number which is
       returned. (see cD&itoacA). Abbreviated command is cD&atocA.

    cD&itoacA cCnumcA
    
       Converts an integer cCnumcA to it's ASCII character representation which
       is returned to the caller. Abbreviated command is cD&itocA.

    cD&gmodecA cCmodecA
    
       Returns cG1cA if the given mode cCmodecA is globally enabled. Allows macros to
       test the global mode state (see lsOperating Modes)lmOperating Modesle. Abbreviated command
       is cD&gmocA.

    cD&bmodecA cCmodecA
    
       Returns cG1cA if the mode cCmodecA is enabled in the current buffer. Allows
       macros to test the state of the buffer mode. Abbreviated command is
       cD&bmocA.

    cD&nbmodecA cCbuffercA cCmodecA
    
       Returns cG1cA if the mode cCmodecA is enabled in buffer cCbuffercA . Allows macros
       to test the state of a buffer mode other than the current. Abbreviated
       command is cD&nbmcA.

    cD&inwordcA cCcharcA
    
       cGTRUEcA. If the given character cCcharcA is a 'word' character, see
       lsforward-word(2)lmforward-word(2)le for a description of a 'word' character. Abbreviated
       command is cD&inwcA.

    cD&indirectcA cCstrcA
    
       Evaluate cCstrcA as a variable. The cCstrcA argument is evaluated and takes
       the resulting string, and then uses it as a variable name. i.e. a
       variable may reference another variable which contains the data to be
       referenced. Abbreviated command is cD&indcA.

    cD&existcA cCstrcA
    
       Tests for the existance of cCstrcA which may be a variable or a
       command/macro name, returning cGTRUEcA if the variable or command does
       currently exist. Abbreviated command is cD&exicA.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The cD&exicA function is etremely useful in initializing, for example:

sB
          !if &not &exi %my-init
              ; %my-init is not yet defined so this is the first call
              set-variable %my-init 1
              .
              .

sA
    Or in all the lsfileHooks(2)lmfile hooksle a user defined extension is checked for and
    executed if defined:

sB
          define-macro fhook-c
              .
              .
              ; execute user extensions if macro is defined
              !if &exi my-fhook-c
                  my-fhook-c
              !endif
          !emacro

sA
    The cD&indcA function deserves more explanation. cD&indcA evaluates its string
    argument cCstrcA, takes the resulting string and then uses it as a variable
    name. For example, given the following code sequence:

sB
          ; set up reference table

          set-variable  %one "elephant"
          set-variable  %two "giraffe"
          set-variable  %three "donkey"

          set-variable  %index "%two"
          insert-string &ind %index

sA    
    the string cGcGgiraffecAcA would have been inserted at the point in the current
    buffer.

    The cD&bmodecA invocation allows a calling macro to determine the buffer mode
    state (see lsOperating Modes)lmOperating Modesle. Consider the following example which is a
    macro to perform a case insensitive alphabetic sort using the
    lssort-lines(2)lmsort-lines(2)le function. sort-list sorts according to the state of the
    lsexact(2m)lmexact(2m)le mode, hence the macro has to determine the buffer state in order
    to be able to do the sort.

sB
          define-macro sort-lines-ignore-case
              set-variable #l0 &bmod exact
              -1 buffer-mode "exact"
              !if @?
                  @# sort-lines
              !else
                  sort-lines
              !endif
              &cond #l0 1 -1 buffer-mode "exact"
          !emacro

sA
    The cD&inwordcA function is shown in the following example. In this case the
    mouse is positioned over a word. The cD&inwordcA function is used to determine
    if the cursor is on a valid word character, if so the cursor is placed at
    the start of the word.

sB
          define-macro mouse-control-drop-left
              set-cursor-to-mouse
              !if &inword @wc
                  backward-word
                  set-mark
                  forward-word
              !else
                  ...
              !endif

    !force - Ignore command or macro status


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD!forcecA [cCncA] cCcommandcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD!forcecA ignores the return status of a cCcommandcA while executing a macro.
    When MicroEmacs 2009 executes a macro, if any command fails, the macro is
    terminated at that point. If a line is preceded by a cD!forcecA directive,
    execution continues whether the command succeeds or not. ls$status(5)lm$status(5)le may be
    used following cD!forcecA to determine if the command failed or not.

    A double cD!forcecA can be used to catch a user termination (via the
    lsabort-command(2)lmabort-command(2)le bound to C-g). A macro command aborted by the user will
    be terminated even with a single cD!forcecA directive, but not with two. See
    the example below.

    When specifying a numerical argument with a cCcommandcA, it is placed after
    the cD!forcecA directive and before the cCcommandcA i.e.

sB
          !force 1 forward-char

sA
cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example shows how cD!forcecA is used in conjunction with
    cD$statuscA.

sB
          ; Merge the top two windows

          push-position           ;remember where we are
          1 next-window           ;go to the top window
          delete-window           ;merge it with the second window
          !force pop-position     ;This will continue regardless
          !if $status
              ml-write "Call PASSED"
          !else
              ml-write "Call FAILED"
          !endif
sA
    The following example creates an infinite loop that can only be broken out
    of by a user abort. The calling macro catches this by using a double
    !force and continues. This concept is used by commands which take a
    considerable amount of time yet cannot be simply aborted by the user such
    as the spell-checker's best guess list generator.

sB
          define-macro infinite-loop
              set-variable #l0 1
              !while 1

    The conditional directives allow statements to be executed only if a
    condition specified in the directive is met, as follows:-

    - Every line following the cD!ifcA directive, until the first cD!elifcA, cD!elsecA
          or !endif directive, is only executed if the expression following
          the !if directive evaluates to a TRUE value (non-zero).

    - If the cD!ifcA evaluates to cGFALSEcA and a cD!elifcA directive is next then the
          expression following the !if is evaluated and following statements
          are executed if TRUE.

    - If no cD!ifcA or cD!elifcA is found to be cGTRUEcA and a cD!elsecA is found then the
          statements following it are executed.

    The cCconditioncA may be any logical condition as evaluated by the
    lsvariable functionslmIntroduction to Variable Functionsle (e.g. ls&equal(4)lm&equal(4)le) 
    returning cGTRUEcA or cGFALSEcA. An integer value, non-zero evaluates cGTRUEcA, 
    zero evaluates to cGFALSEcA. A non-numerical  argument, such as a string is always cGFALSEcA.

    The cCconditional bodycA may be any cDMicroEmacs 2009cA function, macro or
    directive with the exception of cDdefine-macrocA and cD!emacrocA. All directives
    that alter the execution of the macro are handled correctly within the cD!ifcA
    statement (e.g. ls!goto(4)lm!gotole, ls!return(4)lm!returnle etc.

    cD!iifcA  provides an optimal way to write an cD!ifcA statement with exactly
    one body line and no cD!elifcA or cD!elsecA statements.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following macro segment creates the portion of a text file
    automatically. (yes believe me, this will be easier to understand then
    that last explanation....)

sB
          !if &sequal %curplace "timespace vortex"
              insert-string "First, rematerialize\n"
          !endif
          !if &sequal %planet "earth" ;If we have landed on earth...
              !if &sequal %time "late 20th century"  ;and we are then
                  ml-write "Contact U.N.I.T."
              !elif &sequal %time "pre 20th century"
                  ml-write "start praying for a miracle"
              !else
                  insert-string "Investigate the situation....\n"
                  insert-string "(SAY 'stay here Sara')\n"
              !endif
          !else
              set-variable %conditions @ml"Atmosphere conditions outside? "
              !if &sequal %conditions "safe"
                  insert-string &cat "Go outside......" "\n"
                  insert-string "lock the door\n"
              !else
                  insert-string "Dematerialize..try somewhere else"
                  newline
              !endif
          !endif
          
          ;  The first !if-!endif statement in the above example can be optimised to:- 
          !iif &sequal %curplace "timespace vortex"  insert-string "First, rematerialize\n"

cENOTES cA

    There is a convention in macro code of using 2 spaces to separate the
    cCconditioncA from the cCbodycA of an cD!iifcA statement making it easier to locate
    the start of the body.

    cD*cAcClabelcA  


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    Flow can be controlled within a MicroEmacs 2009 macro using the cD!gotocA
    directive. It takes as an argument a cClabelcA. A cClabelcA consists of a line
    starting with an asterisk (cD*cA) and then an alphanumeric label. Only labels
    in the currently executing macro can be jumped to, trying to jump to a
    non-existing label terminates execution of a macro. cClabelscA may be located
    at any position within the macro (forwards or backwards from the cD!gotocA).

    A conditional jump may be implemented with a cD!tgotocA, this takes an
    additional argument cCconditioncA, which may be a literal numeric value, a
    variable or an evaluated expression (see lsIntroduction to Variable Functions)lmVariable Functionsle. If the
    cCconditioncA evaluates to TRUE (or non-zero) then the branch is taken and
    control continues from the cClabelcA.

    cD!tgotocA is an ideal replacement for ls!while(4)lm!while(4)le and ls!repeat(4)lm!repeat(4)le where nested
    loops are required.

    For example, create a block of DATA statements for a BASIC program:

sB

                  !if &equal %data 0
                      !goto finish
                  !endif

cENOTES cA


    cD!gotocA and cD!tgotocA are expensive operations because a symbolic name lookup
    is performed in the macro file. For time critical macros then the ls!jump(4)lm!jump(4)le
    and ls!tjump(4)lm!tjump(4)le directives should be used as these do not perform a symbolic
    name search. The cCjumpcA equivalents are source sensitive since a line
    displacement rather than a cClabelcA is used - this makes them a little
    dangerous to use.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD!returncA [cCncA]  
    cD!abortcA [cCncA]  


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cD!returncA directive causes the current macro to exit with a cGTRUEcA status,
    either returning to the caller (if any) or to interactive mode. If an
    argument cCncA is specified then the return status is determined by the value
    of cCncA.

    cD!abortcA has the same effect as cD!returncA only always returning a cGFALSEcA status
    to halt the execution of any calling macro. If an argument cCncA is given to
    cD!abortcA the bell is also rung, the valid values of cGncA are the same as for
    the ls!bell(4)lm!bell(4)le directive.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example checks the current language and warns if it has not
    be set, i.e. cGDefaultcA.

sB
          ; Check the current language

          !if &not &seq %language "Default"
              !return
          !endif
          ml-write "Warning - you have not setup the Language - use user-setup"

sA
    The following example is shows the logic of the cD!returncA directive:-

sB
          define-macro i-will-return
              ml-write "you will see me"
              !return
              ml-write "you wont see me"
          !emacro

          define-macro test-return

              i-will-return
              ml-write "you will see me"
          !emacro

    Similarly, for the cD!abortcA directive

sB
          ; !abort example
          define-macro i-will-abort
              ml-write "you will see me"

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cD!whilecA directive allows statements only to be executed if a cCconditioncA
    specified in the directive is met. Every line following the cD!whilecA
    directive, until the first cD!donecA directive, is only executed if the
    expression following the cD!whilecA directive evaluates to a cGTRUEcA value.

    A cD!continuecA may be used in the loop, this immediately returns control to
    the cD!whilecA statement and skips the rest of the section.

    cD!while statement may not be nested.cA That is, only one cD!whilecA statement may
    be outstanding at a time, a ls!repeat(4)lm!repeat(4)le statement may be used within the
    cD!whilecA to create an inner loop if required. Alternatively the ls!goto(4)lm!goto(4)le
    used in conjunction with the ls!if(4)lm!if(4)le statement may be used to construct
    loops.

    !bell - Sound audio alarm


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD!bellcA [cCncA]


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD!bellcA provides a warning (audible or visual) to alert the user of a
    problem. cD!bellcA honors the ls$quiet(5)lmquiet(5)le setting, as such if cDquietcA mode is
    disabled an audible warning is given, otherwise a visual warning is given
    to the user (usually the message "cC[BELL]cA" in the bottom left hand corner
    of the message line).

    The optional numerical argument cCncA over-rides the current setting of cDquitecA,
    a value of cG0cA specifies a quite bell, cG2cA an audible one, when omitted the
    default is cG1cA honoring the setting of cDquitecA mode.

    cD!bellcA is generally used in conjunction with ls!return(4)lm!abortle, the !bell function
    warning the user and the !abort function to quit the macro.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following macro example checks for incoming mail and is taken from
    cGmail.emfcA. If any mail has arrived an audible warning is assured by
    toggling the cDquietcA mode.

cEcENAME cEcA


    @?, @#, @0, @1, @2, @3, ... @p - Macro arguments


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD@?cA - Boolean flagging if a numeric argument was supplied  
    cD@#cA - The value of the numeric argument  

    cD@0cA - The name of the macro  
    cD@1cA - The first argument of macro  
    cD@2cA - The second argument of macro  
    cD@3cA ... cD@cAcCncA  

    cD@pcA - The name of the calling (or parent) macro.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    Macros may be passed arguments, allowing a macro to be used by other
    macros. The cD@?cA and cD@#cA are used to determine the numeric argument given to
    the command. The cD@cAcCncA variable (where cCncA is an integer) used in the context
    of a macro allows the macro body to determine it's arguments.

    From a macro all commands are called in the following form

    [num] <macro-name> "arg1" "arg2" ....


    When executed macros do not have to be given an argument, in this case cD@?cA
    will be cC0cA and cD@#cA will be cC1cA (the default argument). If an argument is given
    then cD@?cA will be cC1cA and cD@#cA will be set to the numeric argument given.

    The current macro command name cC<macro-name>cA can be obtain by using the cD@0cA
    variable, e.g.

sB
          define-macro Test-it
              ml-write @0
          !emacro

sA
    When executed, writes the message cGcGTest-itcAcA which is the name of the
    macro.

    Arguments may be passed into macro commands in the same way as standard
    commands are given arguments. The macro being called can access these by
    the cD@1cA to cD@ncA variables, where cCncA is a positive integer. Any variables given
    as arguments are evaluated so if the variable name is required then
    enclose it in quotes, e.g.

sB
          set-variable %test-var "Hello World"

          define-macro Test-it
              ml-write &cat &cat &cat &cat @0 " " @1 " = " &ind @1
              set-variable  @1 @2
          !emacro

          Test-it "%test-var" "Goodbye World"

sA
    On execution the macro writes the message

        "`Test-it %test-var = Hello World`"

    and will set variable cG%test-varcA to cG`Goodbye World`cA. Note that the cD@1cA has
    been used by reference on the cDset-variablecA rather than by value as it is
    used in an assignment.

    The cD@pcA variable can be used to obtain the name of the macro which is
    executing the current macro, i.e. the value of the parent's cD@0cA variable.
    If the macro was executed directly by the user then there is no parent
    macro and the value of cD@pcA is an empty string ("").

    The variables cD@#cA and cD@?cA are automatically set on entry to a macro, the
    values may be over-written by the calling macro if required, but their
    assignment values are restricted to being integer values, assignment of a
    character string causes an error.


cEDIAGNOSTICS cA


    If an attempt is made to access an argument which has not been given then
    a error occurs. This error can be trapped using the ls!force(4)lm!force(4)le directive,
    enabling the macro to take appropriate action, see example.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    Consider the implementation of lsreplace-all-string(3)lmreplace-all-string(3)le macro defined in
    search.emf:

sB
          define-macro replace-all-string
              !force set-variable #l0 @3
              !if &not $status
                  set-variable #l1 @ml05 "Replace all"
                  set-variable #l2 @ml05 &spr "Replace [%s] with" #l1
                  set-variable #l0 @ml00 "In files"
              !else
                  set-variable #l1 @1
                  set-variable #l2 @2
              !endif
              .
              .
              .
          !emacro

sA
    In this example if the 3rd argument is not given then the macro gets all
    arguments from the user.

    The cD@pcA variable having a value of "" when a macro is called directly by
    the user can be useful when determining the amount of information to
    feed-back to the user. For example, executing the lsclean(3)lmcleanle macro is an easy
    way to remove surplus white characters, so it is often used by other
    macros as well as by the user. When called directly cDcleancA refreshes the
    display and prints a message of completion, but when called by other
    macros this would cause an unwanted screen-update and message, so clean
    only does this when executed by the user. This is done as follows:

sB
          define-macro clean
              ;
              ; Prepare to clean up file.
              .
              .
              .

cENOTES cA


    The parsing of arguments can be inefficient because of the way the
    arguments have to be parsed; to get the 4th argument the 1st, 2nd and 3rd
    arguments must be evaluated. This is because each argument is not
    guaranteed to be only one element, it could be an expression which needs
    to be evaluated. Consider the following invocation of our Test-it macro

sB
          Test-it &cat "%test" "-var" "Goodbye World"

sA
    The 2nd argument is not cC"%test"cA as this is part of the first argument, the
    2nd argument is in fact the 4th element and the invocation will have the
    same effect except slower.

    cD@mxcA "cCcommand-linecA"  
    cD@mxacA "cCcommand-linecA"


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDMessage Line VariablescA provide a method to prompt the user for an
    input returning the data to the caller. The cD@mncA variable cause MicroEmacs
    to input data from the user in the default way for that command's
    argument, i.e. the normal prompt with the normal history and completion
    etc. Similarly cD@mnacA causes MicroEmacs to input the current argument and
    any subsequent arguments in the default way.

    The cD@mlcA variable can be used to get a string (or Line) of text from the
    user using the message-line in a very flexible way. The first optional
    flag cDfcA is a bitwise flag where each bit has the following meaning

    cG0x01cA
    
       The cCdefaultcA value will be specified and this will be returned by
       default.

    cG0x02cA
    
       The cCinitialcA value will be specified and this will be initial value
       given on the input line.

    cG0x04cA
    
       Auto-complete using the initial value, usually used with bit cG0x02cA.

    cG0x08cA
    
       Hide the input string, the characters in the current input string are
       all displayed as cG'*'cAs.

    If no value is specified then default value is 0 and cDhcA can not be
    specified. The cCdefaultcA value is returned when the user enters an empty
    string. If the cCinitialcA string is specified the the input buffer will be
    initialized to the given string instead of and empty one.

    The flag cDhcA specifies what type of data is to be entered, this specifies
    the history to be used and the semantics allowed, cDhcA can have the following
    values

        `0` For a general string input using the general history.
        `1` For an absolute file name, with completion and history.
        `2` For a MicroEmacs 2009 buffer name, with completion and history.
        `3` For a MicroEmacs 2009 command name, with completion and history.
        `4` For a file name, with completion and history.
        `5` For a search string, with history.
        `6` For a MicroEmacs 2009 mode name, with completion and history.
        `7` For a MicroEmacs 2009 variable name, with completion and history.
        `8` For a general string using no history.
        `9` For a user supplied completion list (`com-list`).
        `a` For a user supplied completion list (`buffer-name`).

    A default value of 0 is used if no value is specified. At first glance
    type 1 and 4 appear to be the same. They differ only when a non absolute
    file name is entered, such as "foobar". Type 1 will turn this into an
    absolute path, i.e. if the current directory is cGcG/tmpcAcA then it will return
    cGcG/tmp/foobarcAcA. Type 4 however will return just "foobar", this is
    particularly useful with the ls&find(4)lm&find(4)le function to then find the file
    "foobar".

    When a value of cG9cA is used the argument cCcom-listcA must be given which
    specifies a list of completion values in the form of a MicroEmacs list
    (see help on ls&lget(4)lm&lget(4)le for further information on lists). The user may
    enter another value which is not in the list, which will be returned.

    Alternatively a completion list may be given in the form of a buffer using
    a value of cGacA. The argument cCbuffer-namecA must be given to specify the buffer
    name from which to extract the completion list; each line of the buffer is
    taken as a completion value. This option is particularly useful for large
    completion lists as there is no size restrictions.

    The cD@mccA variable can be used to get a single character from the user using
    the message-line. The optional flag cDfcA is a bitwise flag where each bit has
    the following meaning

    cG0x01cA
    
       The cCvalid-listcA specifies all valid letters.

    cG0x02cA
    
       Quote the typed character, this allows keys such as cCcGC-gcAcA which is
       bound to the abort command to be entered.

    cG0x04cA
    
       A cChelp-stringcA is given which will be displayed if the user presses
       cCcG?cAcA.

    The default value for cDfcA is 0. When cD@mccA is used, the user is prompted, with
    the given prompt, for a single character. If a cCvalid-listcA is specified
    then only a specified valid character or an error can be returned. For
    example, a yes/no prompt can be implemented by the following

sB
          !if &iseq @mc1 "Are you bored (yn) ? " "yYnN" "y"
              save-buffers-exit-emacs
          !endif

sA
    By using the ls&isequal(4)lm&isequal(4)le operator a return of "Y" or "y" will match with
    "y". However, there are two problems with this, firstly if the user aborts
    by pressing cCcGC-gcAcA a macro error will be generated because the cD&iseqcA
    operator failed to get 2 arguments. The second problem is that the meaning
    of cGcG(yn)cAcA may not be obvious to all users so a help string should be
    supplied. To address these 2 issues the following should be used in
    preference:

sB
          set-variable #l0 @mc5 "Are you bored (?yn) ? " "yYnN" "(Y)es, (N)no, (C-g)Abort ? "
          !if &iseq #l0 "y"
              save-buffers-exit-emacs
          !endif

sA
    When the cD@mxcA variable is used MicroEmacs sets the system variable
    ls$result(5)lm$result(5)le to the input prompt, it will then execute the given
    cGcommand-linecA. If this command aborts then so does the calling command, if
    it succeeds then the input value is taken from the cD$resultcA variable.
    Similarly cD@mxacA causes MicroEmacs to get the current and any subsequent
    arguments in this way.

    These variables are useful when trying to use existing commands in a
    different way, such as trying to provide a GUI to an existing command. See
    the cDdelete-buffercA example below.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example can be used to prompt the user to save any buffer
    changes, the use of cD@mnacA ensures the user will be prompted as usual
    regardless of the number of buffers changed:

sB
          save-some-buffers @mna

sA
    The following example sets cG%languagecA to a language supplied by the user
    from a given list, giving the current setting as a default

sB
          set-variable %languages "|American|British|French|Spanish|"
          set-variable %language "American"

          set-variable %language @ml19 "Language" %language %languages

sA
    The following example is taken from cGdiff-changescA in tools.emf, it uses cD@mccA
    to prompt the user to save the buffer before continuing:-

sB
          define-macro diff-changes
              !if &seq $buffer-fname ""
                  ml-write "[Current buffer has no file name]"
                  !abort
              !endif
              !if &bmod "edit"
                  set-variable #l0 @mc5 "Save buffer first (?yn) ? " "nNyY" "(Y)es, (N)o, (C-g)Abort ? "
                  !if &iseq #l0 "y"
                      save-buffer
                  !endif
              !endif
                  .
                  .

sA
    Note that the input is case insensitive. The following version would not
    work as the user may expect when the buffer has not been edited:

sB
              !if &and &bmod "edit" &iseq @mc1 "Save buffer first (?yn) ? " "nNyY" "y"
                  save-buffer
                  .
                  .

sA
    Unlike cDCcA and other similar languages MicroEmacs macro language always
    evaluates both cD&andcA arguments. This means that the user will be prompted
    to save the buffer regardless of whether the buffer has been edited.

    The cD@mxcA variables are useful when using existing commands in a new
    environment. For example, consider providing a GUI for the
    lsdelete-buffer(2)lmdelete-buffer(2)le command, when executed the calling GUI may not be aware
    that changes could be lost or a process may still be active. These
    variables can be used as a call back mechanism to handle this problem:

sB
          define-macro osd-delete-buffer-callback
              !if &sin "Discard changes" $result
                  2 osd-xdialog "Delete Buffer" "  Dicard changes?  " 2 10 6 "&Yes" "&No"
                  set-variable $result &cond &equ $result 1 "y" "n"
              !elif &sin "Kill active process" $result
                  2 osd-xdialog "Delete Buffer" "  Kill active process?  " 2 10 6 "&Yes" "&No"
                  set-variable $result &cond &equ $result 1 "y" "n"
              !else
                  1000 ml-write &spr "[Unknown prompt %s]" $result
                  !abort
              !endif
          !emacro

          define-macro osd-delete-buffer
              .
              . set #l0 to buffer name to be deleted
              .

    @wc, @wl - Extract characters from the current buffer


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD@wlcA  
    cD@wccA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    Buffer variables allow text to be taken from the current buffer and placed
    into a variable. Two types of extraction are provided cD@wlcA provides a line
    extraction method, cD@wccA provides a character extraction method.

    For example, if the current buffer contains the following text:

        Richmond
        Lafayette
        <*>Bloomington                (where <*> is the current point)
        Indianapolis
        Gary
        =* me (BE..) == rigel2 == (c:/data/rigel2.txt) ===================


    The cD@wlcA variable allows text from the current buffer to be accessed, a
    command such as:-

sB
          set-variable %line @wl

sA
    would start at the current point in the current buffer and grab all the
    text up to the end of that line and pass that back. Then it would advance
    the point to the beginning of the next line. Thus, after the lsset-variable(2)lmset-variablele
    command executes, the string cGcGBloomingtoncAcA is placed in the variable cD%linecA
    and the buffer rigel2 now looks like this:

        Richmond
        Lafayette
        Bloomington
        <*>Indianapolis               (where <*> is the current point)
        Gary
        =* me (BE..) == rigel2 == (c:/data/rigel2.txt) ===================


    The buffer command cD@wccA gets the current character in the buffer, it does
    not change the buffer position. It is important to stress that the cursor
    position is not modified, in general a macro will interrogate the
    character under the cursor and then affect the buffer (i.e. by moving the
    cursor, deleting the character etc.) dependent upon the value of the
    character returned.

    Assignment of the variables causes the buffer contents to be modified,
    deleting the pervious contents and setting the new value. This can be
    useful in certain situations but should be performed with care.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The cD@wccA variable provides the most useful mechanism to modify the current
    buffer. The following example is a macro called cDsuper-deletecA which is
    bound to cG<CTRL-del>cA. The macro deletes characters under the cursor in
    blocks. If a white space character is under the cursor then all characters
    up until the next non-white space character are deleted. If a non-white
    space character is under the cursor then all non-white space characters up
    until the next white space character are deleted, then the white space is
    deleted. White space in this context is a cGSPACEcA, cGtabcA or cGCRcA character.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The Command Variables allow macros to obtain MicroEmacs 2009 input
    commands and keystrokes from the user. The general format of the command
    is:-

       cD@ccAcCicA[cDkcA]

    Where,

    cCicA - Determines the source of the input as follows:-

       cDlcA

         The last input entered.

       cDccA
     
         The current input entered.

       cDqcA
     
         Provides a low level character input mechanism, obtaining a single
          raw character input from the user. The input fetch does not
          interact with the message line and the user is NOT prompted for
          input (use lsml-write(2)lmml-write(2)le to create your own message). @cq is very
          low level, it is generally preferable to use @cg which provides a
          more intelligent binding.

       cDgcA

         Like @cq, @cg[k] gets a single character input, however if the
          input is bound to a function then the function name is returned
          instead of the character e.g. if ^F or <left-arrow> is depressed
          then forward-char is returned. This has distinct advantages over
          @cq as the binding becomes device independent and executes on all
          platforms. In addition, it honors the users bindings, however
          bizarre.

      cDkcA

         When, omitted command input is returned to the caller (i.e. the name
          of the command, such as cGcGforward-charcAcA). When present, the raw
          keystroke is returned to the caller, i.e. "cG^FcA (control-F)".

    The cD@clcA, cD@clkcA, cD@cccA and cD@cckcA variables can also be set, this feature can be
    used by macros to change the command history. While setting the current
    command is limited in use, setting the last command can be immensely
    useful, consider the following macro code:-

sB
          kill-line
          forward-line
          set-variable @cl kill-line
          kill-line

sA
    Without the setting of the cD@clcA variable, the current kill buffer will
    contain only the last line. But the setting of cD@clcA to kill-line fools
    MicroEmacs into thinking the last command was a kill command so the last
    kill line as appended to the current yank buffer, i.e. the kill buffer
    will have both lines in it.

    This feature can be used for any command whose effect depends on the
    previous command. Such commands include lsforward-line(2)lmforward-line(2)le, lskill-region(2)lmkill-region(2)le,
    lsreyank(2)lmreyank(2)le and lsundo(2)lmundo(2)le. This feature should not be abused as unexpected
    things may happen.


cESummary  cA


    cD@clcA
    
       Get or set the last command.

    cD@clkcA
    
       Get or set the last key stroke.

    cD@cccA
    
       Get or set the current command.

    cD@cckcA
    
       Get or set the current keystroke.

    cD@cgcA
    
       Get a command name from the user.

    cD@cgkcA
    
       Get a keystroke from the user.

    cD@cqcA
    
       Get a quoted command name from the user.

    cD@cqkcA
    
       Get a quoted keystroke from the user.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example shows how the cD@cccA and cD@clcA commands are used:-

sB
          define-macro current-last-command
              insert-string &spr "Last key [%s] name [%s]\n" @clk @cl
              insert-string &spr "Current key [%s] name [%s]\n" @cck @cc
          !emacro

sA
    Pressing the up key and then executing this macro using
    execute-named-command (esc x) will insert the lines:-

        Last key [up] name [backward-line]
        Current key [esc x] name [execute-named-command]


    cD@cgcA like cD@cqcA gets a single character input, however if the keyboard input
    is bound to a function then the function name is returned instead of the
    character e.g. if cG^FcA or cG<left-arrow>cA is depressed then cDforward-charcA is
    returned. This has distinct advantages over cD@cqcA as the binding becomes
    device independent and executes on all platforms, additionally it honors
    the users bindings, however bizarre.

    cD@cqcA provides a low level character input mechanism, obtaining a single raw
    character input from the user. This does not interact with the message
    line and the user is not prompted for input (use lsml-write(2)lmml-write(2)le to create
    your own message). cD@cqcA is very low level, it is generally preferable to
    use cD@cgcA which provides a more intelligent binding.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example is taken from cGdraw.emfcA which uses cD@cgcA to obtain
    cursor movements from the user. Note how the input from cD@cgcA (stored in
    variable cD%dw-commcA) is compared with the binding name rather than any
    keyboard characters.

    Variables - Macro variables


cESYNOPSIS cA

    cD:cA_bufferName_cD:_cAvariableName_


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    Variables are part of MicroEmacs macro language and may be used wherever
    an argument is required. The variable space comprises:-

    -  cD#cA - Register Variable
    -  cD$cA - System Variable
    -  cD%cA - Global Variable
    -  cD.cA - Command Variable
    -  cD:cA - Buffer Variable

    All variables hold string information, the interpretation of the string
    (numeric, string or boolean) is determined when the variable is used
    within the context of the command. There are five types of variable,
    cDRegistercA cDVariablescA (prefixed with a hash cD#cA), cDSystem VariablescA (prefixed
    with a dollar cD$cA), cDGlobal VariablescA (prefixed with a percentage cD%cA), Buffer
    Variables (prefixed with a colon cD:cA) and cDCommand VariablescA (prefixed with a
    period cD.cA).


cERegister Variables  cA


    Register Variables provide a set of 10 prefixed global (cD#g0cA .. cD#g9cA),
    parent (cD#p0cA .. cD#p9cA) and local (cD#l0cA .. cD#l9cA) register variables. The
    interpreted decode time of the register variables is significantly smaller
    than other variable types as no name space search is performed.

    Register variables are assigned using lsset-variable(2)lmset-variable(2)le, their value may be
    queried with lsdescribe-variable(2)lmdescribe-variable(2)le, unlike Global Buffer or Command
    variables they cannot be deleted.

    Register variables are implemented like a stack, where the global
    registers are the top of the stack and every executing macro gets its own
    set of resister variables (cD#l?cA). The macro also has access to the global
    registers (cD#g?cA) and its calling, or parent macro (cD#p?cA). If the macro has
    no parent macro then the global registers are also the parent registers.
    Outside macros, i.e. using cDset-variablecA manually, the global parent and
    local registers are the same.

    Register variables are typically used for retaining short term state,
    computation steps etc. As with the User Variables, the global register
    variables are global and care must be taken with nested macro invocations
    to ensure that the register usage does not conflict.


cESystem Variables  cA


    MicroEmacs defines many System variables which are used to configure many
    aspects of the editors environment. The functionality of each system
    variable has been documented, they can be set and described but cannot be
    unset. If the user attempts to set or describe a non-existent MicroEmacs
    system variable (e.g. cD$PATHcA) the system environment is used instead,
    allowing the user to query and alter the system environment.


cEGlobal, Command and Buffer Variables  cA


    The Global variables are denoted by an initial cD%cA character followed by the
    name of the variable cCvariableNamecA. The cCvariableNamecA may be any ASCII
    character string up to 127 characters in length, all characters of the
    name are significant. Shorter names are preferred as this speeds up
    execution. Global Variables exist in a global context which all macros
    have access to.

    Command variables exist within the scope of a command, they are denoted by
    the period (cD.cA) character. They can be accessed by one of two forms, either
    cD.cAcCvariableNamecA or cD.cA_commandName_cD._cAvariableName_. The first form, without the
    command name, assumes the scope to be the current command, as such may
    only be used to access internal variables. The second form qualifies the
    scope by specifying the command, this form is much more versatile and may
    be used to access any command variable from any other command, e.g.

sB
          define-macro foo
              set-variable .foo "Hello world"
              1000 ml-write &cat "foo1: " .foo
              1000 ml-write &cat "foo2: " .foo.foo
          !emacro
          define-macro bar
              foo
              1000 ml-write &cat "bar1: " .foo
              1000 ml-write &cat "bar2: " .foo.foo
          !emacro

          bar

sA
    When cDbarcA is executed the following messages may be observed:-

        foo1: Hello World
        foo2: Hello World
        bar1: ERROR
        bar2: Hello World


    When a macro file or buffer is executed, they are executed within their
    own scope so local scope command variables (form 1) may be created and
    used in that scope. Any such variables created are automatically deleted
    at the end of execution. For example, the default color scheme generator
    macro file, cGschemed.emfcA, creates command variables for the created colors
    to aid readability:-

sB
          add-color &set .green     3 0   200 0
          a0dd-color &set .lgreen   11 0   255 0

          ...

          add-color-scheme .scheme.cardback   .lgreen   .green   .lgreen ...

sA
    The variables only exist as a file or buffer is being executed, they are
    not accessible by another command once the command or buffer execution has
    finished.

    Buffer variables are similar to Command variable in function and behaviour
    except that their scope is of a buffer and are denoted by the colon (cD:cA)
    character. Access can be in one of two forms, either cD:cAcCvariableNamecA where
    the scope is assumed to be the current buffer or cD:cA_bufferName_cD:_cAvariableName_,
    where the scope is explicitly given allowing access to any buffer
    variable, e.g.

sB
          find-buffer "foo"
          set-variable :foo "Hello world"
          find-buffer "bar"
          set-variable :bar "Hello world"
          1000 ml-write &cat ":foo     " :foo
          1000 ml-write &cat ":foo:foo " :foo:foo
          1000 ml-write &cat ":bar     " :bar
          1000 ml-write &cat ":bar:bar " :bar:bar

sA
    When the above is executed the following messages may be observed:-

        :foo     ERROR
        :foo:foo Hello World
        :bar     Hello World
        :bar:bar Hello World


    Global, Buffer and Command variables are automatically defined when they
    are used. A variable is assigned with lsset-variable(2)lmset-variable(2)le and may be
    subsequently deleted with lsunset-variable(2)lmunset-variable(2)le. The current assignment of a
    variable may be queried from the command line using lsdescribe-variable(2)lmdescribe-variable(2)le.
    e.g.

sB
          define-macro foo
          !emacro
          set-variable %foo "Some string"
          set-variable :bar "Some string"
          set-variable .foo.bar "Some string"

          ...

          ml-write &spr "%s %s %s" %foo :bar .foo.bar

          ...

          unset-variable :bar
          unset-variable %foo
          unset-variable .foo.bar

sA
    An undefined variable returns the string cGERRORcA, this known state is used
    to advantage with the lshilight(2)lmhilightingle initialization, e.g.

sB
          !if &sequal .hilight.c "ERROR"
              set-variable .hilight.c &pinc .hilight.next 1
          !endif
          ;
          ; Hi-light C Mode
          ;
          0 hilight .hilight.c  2 50             $global-scheme

sA
    In this case the variable cD.hilight.ccA is explicitly tested for definition,
    if it is undefined then it is assigned a new value.

    Conventionally, names are separated with a minus sign character (cD-cA) e.g.
    cGfoo-barcA. It is strongly advised that the name space is kept reasonably
    clean, since there are no restrictions on the number of macros that may be
    defined, problems will arise if different macros use the same variables in
    different contexts. Where possible, Command or Buffer Variables are
    preferable to Global Variables since they have no side effects on other
    macros or buffers. It is advised that all variable names associated with a
    particular macro set are prefixed with short identifier to make the
    variable name space unique. e.g. the cDMetriscA macro prefixes all variables
    with cD:met-cA; the cDdrawcA macro uses cD:dw-cA, the cDpatiencecA macro cD:pat-cA etc.

    Macro writers should endeavor to use the minimal number of variables,
    obviously the more variables that exist in the system, the greater the
    lookup time to find a variable. Use Register Variables in preference to
    Command, Global or Buffer variables for intimidate computation steps,
    temporary state etc.

    Note that Buffer Variables are automatically deleted when the buffer is
    deleted.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example is the macro to convert tabs to spaces, it is shown
    in two forms, with User Variables and with Register Variables, the
    register variable implementation is obviously preferable since no new
    variables have been defined.

! 4 MacroNumericArguments
cEcENAME cEcA


    @#, @? - Macro numeric arguments


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD@#cA - The numerical argument to a macro  
    cD@?cA - The truth of the numerical argument to a macro


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    All built-in commands and macros are invoked with a numerical argument.
    The argument is obtained from either the command line when the user
    invokes a command line such as:

       cDesc 5 esc x forward-charcA

    where the argument is entered after lsprefix(2)lmprefix 1le (cDesccA). In this case, causing
    the cursor to be moved forward 5 characters. Within a macro file the same
    operation is defined as:-

       cD5 forward-charcA

    In both cases the numerical argument 5 is passed to the command requesting
    that the resultant operation is performed 5 times in succession before
    returning. The command itself is invoked once, it is the responsibility of
    the command to iterate if requested.

    The command determines how the numerical argument is interpreted, in the
    case of lsspell-buffer(3)lmspell-wordle the argument identifies the type of word that is being
    spelled and NOT the number of words to spell.

    The invocation of named macros operate in the same way, the macro may use
    the variables cD@?cA and cD@#cA to determine the status of the numerical argument
    passed to it. The variables are interpreted as follows:

    cD@?cA
    
       A logical value defined as cGTRUEcA (1) if a numerical argument has been
       specified, otherwise cGFALSEcA (0).

    cD@#cA
    
       A signed integer value of the supplied numeric argument. If no
       argument is supplied (i.e. cD@?cA==cGFALSEcA) then cD@#cA is set to 1.

    The cD@?cA and cD@#cA are only valid for the current macro invocation. Other
    macros or commands that are invoked have their own values of cD@?cA and cD@#cA.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    Consider the following example, which sorts lines into alphabetical order
    using the lssort-lines(2)lmsort-lines(2)le function. A new command cDsort-lines-ignore-casecA is
    created using a macro to sort lines case insensitively regardless of the
    current buffer mode. The command cDsort-linescA takes an optional argument
    which determines which column should be used to perform the sort.

sB
          ;
          ; sort-lines-ignore-case
          ; Sort lines case insensitively regardless of the current 'exact' mode
          ; setting.
          define-macro sort-lines-ignore-case
              set-variable #l0 &bmod exact
              -1 buffer-mode "exact"
              !if @?
                  @# sort-lines
              !else
                  sort-lines
              !endif
              &cond #l0 1 -1 buffer-mode "exact"
          !emacro

sA
    cD@?cA is used to test the presence of the argument, if it is false cDsort-linescA
    is invoked without an argument. When true the numeric argument is
    propagated e.g. cD@# sort-linescA.

    This particular macro highlights an important consideration when passing
    the numerical argument to other functions, had the macro been implemented
    as:

sB
          ; INCORRECT IMPLEMENTATION
          define-macro sort-lines-ignore-case
              set-variable #l0 &bmod exact
              -1 buffer-mode "exact"
              @# sort-lines
              &cond #l0 1 -1 buffer-mode "exact"
          !emacro

sA
    then when cDsort-lines-ignore-casecA is invoked with no arguments cD@#cA is
    defined as 1, this is would be incorrectly propagated to cDsort-linescA
    causing it to sort on column 1 rather than column 0 as expected.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD@ycA - Yank buffer variable


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cCYank Buffer VariablecA cD@ycA retrieves the current lsyank(2)lmyank(2)le string from the
    kill buffer and returns it to the caller.

    The cD@ycA variable may be set to change the kill ring buffer.

    The cCYank Buffer VariablecA may be specified with a numeric qualifier to
    access one of the historical yank buffers cD@y0cA to cD@y15cA to directly extract
    text from the kill-ring.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The current contents of the yank buffer can be obtained using cD@ycA, so to
    set variable cG#l1cA to the current or last word if the cursor is not in a
    word, simply use:

sB

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The bitwise operators perform bit operations on numeric values returning a
    numerical result of the operation.

    The functions may all be abbreviated to their three letter abbreviation
    (i.e. cD&bandcA may be expressed as cD&bancA). In all cases the first argument is
    completely evaluated before the second argument.

    cD&band cAcCnum1cA cCnum2cA
    
       Bitwise AND of cCnum1cA and cCnum2cA i.e. cCnum1cA & cCnum2cA.

    cD&borcA cCnum1cA cCnum2cA
    
       Bitwise (inclusive) OR of cCnum1cA and cCnum2cA i.e. cCnum1cA | cCnum2cA.

    cD&bxorcA cCnum1cA cCnum2cA
    
       Bitwise (exclusive OR) XOR of cCnum1cA and cCnum2cA i.e. cCnum1cA ^ cCnum2cA.

    cD&notcA cCnumcA
    
       Bitwise NOT operator of cCnumcA, inverts the state of all bits i.e. ~cCnumcA.

    Evaluation of the bitwise operators are left to right, the leftmost
    argument is fully evaluated before the next argument. The operator
    ordering is prefix notation (see ls&add(4)lm&add(4)le for an example of prefix

              set-variable %z %b
          !endif

sA
    may be replaced with a conditional expression, breaking down the
    components then

       cClogcA is cD&gre %a %bcA  
       cCexpr1cA is cD%acA  
       cCexpr2cA is cD%bcA

    rewriting the expression we get:

sB
          set-variable %z &cond &gre %a %b %a %b

sA
    This is far more concise, albeit a little less readable, but does improve
    the performance of macros as there is less information to interpret.

    The cD&condcA operator accepts three fields, ALL fields are evaluated although
    only one of the results cCexpr1cA or cCexpr2cA is used. The cClogcA field is a logical
    value, if it is non-zero (cGTRUEcA) then the result of the cCexpr1cA evaluation is
    used, otherwise the result of cCexpr2cA is used.

    It should be noted that the conditional expression may be used in any
    construct i.e. ls&add(4)lm&add(4)le, ls&cat(4)lm&cat(4)le, etc. the cCexprcA arguments may be strings,
    numbers or booleans the resultant value of the cCexprcA arguments is simply
    returned to the calling expression.

cEcENAME cEcA


    &set - In-line macro variable assignment


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD&setcA cC<var>cC cA<expr>cA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD&setcA performs an in-line macro variable assignment assigning a variable
    cC<var>cA the value of the expression cC<expr>cA, returning the evaluated result
    to the caller. cC<expr>cA may be numeric, boolean or a string expression.

    cD&setcA is typically used for defining (and simultaneously using) indices
    e.g. as with lsadd-color(2)lmadd-color(2)le or lsadd-color-scheme(2)lmadd-color-scheme(2)le. This is a short-hand of
    lsset-variable(2)lmset-variable(2)le.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example uses cD&setcA to define new colors (see cGcolor.emfcA):

sB

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD&findcA cC<basename>cC cA<extension>cA  
    cD&whichcA cC<progname>cA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD&findcA searches for a named file cC<basename><extension>cA on the MicroEmacs
    2009 search path defined by the variable ls$search-path(5)lm$search-path(5)le, initialized by
    the system of from the the environment variables ls$MEINSTALLPATH(5)lm$MEINSTALLPATH(5)le etc.

    Each path component defined in cD$search-pathcA is prepended to the
    constructed file name and it's existence is tested. If the file exists,
    then the FULL path name of the file is returned to the caller, otherwise
    cGERRORcA.

    cC<basename>cA
    
       The base name of the file, excluding any extension.

    cC<extension>cA
    
       The extension of the file name, this must be specified with the
       extension delimiter, typically dot (cCcG.cAcA). A cGNULLcA string (e.g. cCcG""cAcA)
       may be specified if no extension is required.

    cD&whichcA searches for the given executable program cC<progname>cA on the system
    program search path defined the the environment variable cD$PATHcA.


cEUSAGE cA


    cD&findcA is typically used with lsinsert-file(2)lminsert-file(2)le and lsfind-file(2)lmfind-file(2)le within macro
    scripts, and is used to locate user specific files.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example uses cD&findcA to locate the uses 'C' template file.
    Given a cD$search-pathcA setting of cG/usr/bob/emacs:/usr/local/microemacscA:-

sB
          insert-file &find "c" ".etf"

sA
    Would insert the file cG/usr/bob/emacs/c.etfcA if it existed, else the file

cEcENAME cEcA


    !nmacro - Execute line as if not in a macro


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD!nmacrocA cCcommandcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD!nmacrocA causes cCcommandcA to be executed as if it were initiated from the
    command line by the user, rather than from the macro context. When
    MicroEmacs 2009 executes a macro, by default any input the command
    requires is expected on the same line immediately following the command.
    If a line is preceded by a cD!nmacrocA (or cD!nmacA) directive, the command is
    executed as if it was invoked from the command line by the user, as such,
    the rest of the line is ignored and all input is obtained directly from
    the user, as per normal command interaction.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example is taken from macro file cGmeme3_8.emfcA and shows how
    to add a buffer mode.

sB
          ; Add a buffer mode
          define-macro add-mode
              ; Has the require mode been given as an argument, if so add it
              !force 1 buffer-mode @1
              !if &not $status
                  ; No - use 1 buffer-mode to add a mode
                  !nma 1 buffer-mode
              !endif
          !emacro

sA
    The first line checks that the mode to add has not already been given as a
    macro argument, e.g. by executing the following line

sB
          buffer-add-mode "view"

sA
    If this line fails then the argument was not specified and must be
    obtained from the user as normal.

    cD&cbindcA returns the command bound to the given key sequence, cD&kbindcA can be
    abbreviated to cD&kbicA. If the key is not bound then cD&kbindcA returns the
    string "cCERRORcA".

    cD&nbindcA returns the numerical argument associated with the given key
    binding, cD&nbindcA can be abbreviated to cD&nbicA. If the key is not bound then
    cD&nbindcA returns the string "cCERRORcA", if the binding has no argument then an
    empty string (cG""cA) is returned.

    cD&kbindcA returns a key sequence bound to the given cCcommandcA with the given
    numerical argument cCncA. If no binding can be found then cD&kbindcA returns an
    empty string (cG""cA).


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example waits for the user to press a key, then prints what
    command the key is bound to.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD&statcA returns the specified cC<stat>cA on the given cC<filename>cA. Valid cC<stat>cA
    values are:-

    cDacA
    
       Returns the absolute file name, corrects relative paths and symbolic
       links, i.e. on UNIX if the filename is a symbolic link it returns the
       file name the link points to (recursive), otherwise returns the file
       name.

    cDdcA
    
       Returns the file's modification time stamp as an integer, larger
       values indicate a later time.

    cDicA
    
       Returns information on the file in a ls&ldel(4)lmMicroEmacs listle formatted string.
       The fields within the list are defined as follows:

       1
              File location, which will be one of the following:

                  F   File is an ftp URL file (see note).
                  H   File is a http URL link (see note).
                  L   File is a local file.


       2
              File type, which will be one of the following:

                  D   File is a directory.
                  H   File is a http URL link (no further information is known).

                  R   File is a regular file.
                  X   File does not exist.


              Note the information returned here is different to the 't' flag
              below as the type of an ftp file is evaluated, i.e. D, R or X will
              be returned.

       3
              Symbolic file type, which will be the empty string unless the file
              type above is 'L' in which case it will be one of the following:

                  D   File is a directory.
                  L   File is a symbolic link (UNIX).
                  N   File is an untouchable system file.
                  R   File is a regular file.
                  X   File does not exist.


       4
              File permissions or attributes which are returned as an integer
              value specific to the Operating System.

       5 and 6
              File size given as an upper and lower 32 bit integers for large
              file support, these values will be the empty string if the file
              size could not be determined.

       7
              File modification time given as "YYYYMMDDhhmmss", this field has
              not yet been implemented.

    cDmcA
    
       Returns the file's modification time stamp as a string, the format of
       the string is the same as ls$time(5)lm$time(5)le.

    cDrcA
    
       Returns a non-zero value if the user has permission to read the given
       file.

    cDscA
    
       Returns the size of the file in bytes.

    cDtcA
    
       Returns the type of the file, where values returned are

              X   File does not exist.
              R   File is a regular file.
              D   File is a directory.
              H   File is a http URL link (see note).
              F   File is an ftp URL file (see note).
              N   File is an untouchable system file.


       Note that a URL type is determined from the file name, e.g.
       http://..., and its existence is not verified.

    cDwcA
    
       Returns a non-zero value if the user has permission to write to the
       given file.

    cDxcA
    
       Returns a non-zero value if the user has permission to execute the
       given file.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example is a macro which, given a file name, uses cD&statcA to
    check that file file is regular:

sB
          define-macro test-file
              !force set-variable #l0 @1
              !if &not $status

                  !abort
              !endif
          !emacro

          test-file "foobar"

sA
    The macro can be passed a file name and aborts if the file is not regular,
    there by returning the state.

    The follow example checks that a file is not empty, this is used by
    cDmail-checkcA to test for any incoming mail.

sB
              !if &gre &stat "s" %incoming-mail-box

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD&ldelcA cClistcA cCindexcA  
    cD&lfindcA cClistcA cCvaluecA  
    cD&lgetcA cClistcA cCindexcA

    cD&llencA cClistcA
    cD&lsetcA cClistcA cCindexcA cCvaluecA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The list manipulation functions perform operations on specially formatted
    strings called lists. A list is defined as:

        "|value1|value2|.....|valueN|"


    Where cCcG|cAcA is the dividing character, this is not fixed to a cCcG|cAcA, but is
    defined by the first character of the string. Following are all valid
    lists.

        "|1|2|3|4|5|"  
        "X1X2X3X4X5X"  
        "\CAHello\CAWorld\CA"  
        "??"  

    The functions may all be abbreviated to their three letter abbreviation
    (i.e. cD&linsertcA may be expressed as cD&lincA). In all cases the first argument
    is completely evaluated before the second or third argument.

    cD&ldelcA cClistcA cCindexcA
    
       Creates a new list from deleting item cCindexcA from cClistcA. If cCindexcA is out
       of cClistcA's range (0 < index <= # items in list) then cClistcA is returned
       unchanged.

    cD&lfindcA cClistcA cCvaluecA
    
       Returns the index whose item is the same as cCvaluecA in cClistcA. If cCvaluecA is
       not found in cClistcA then cGcG0cAcA is returned.

    cD&lgetcA cClistcA cCindexcA
    
       Returns the value of item cCindexcA in cClistcA. If cCindexcA is out of cClistcA's
       range (0 < index <= # items in list) then an empty string is returned.

    cD&linsertcA cClistcA cCindexcA cCvaluecA
    
       Creates a new list from inserting cCvaluecA into cClistcA at point cCindexcA,
       thereby pushing item cCindexcA to cCindexcA+1 etc.

       If cCindexcA is cG0cA, cCvaluecA is inserted at the beginning of the list.

       If cCindexcA is cG-2cA, cCvaluecA is inserted alphabetically (case sensitively)
       into the list.

       If cCindexcA is cG-3cA, cCvaluecA is inserted alphabetically (case insensitively)
       into the list.

       Otherwise, if cCindexcA is cG-1cA or greater that the number of items in cClistcA
       then cCvaluecA is inserted at the end of the list.

    cD&llencA cClistcA 
    
       Retrieve the length of the list.
      
    cD&lsetcA cClistcA cCindexcA cCvaluecA
    
       Creates a new list from setting cCindexcA of cClistcA to cCvaluecA. If cCindexcA is
       out of cClistcA's range (0 < index <= # items in list) then cD&lsetcA behaves
       like cD&linsertcA and inserts alphabetically or at the end of the list.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The string logical testing operators perform string comparison tests,
    returning a boolean value of cGTRUEcA (1) or cGFALSEcA (0).

    The functions may all be shortened to their three letter abbreviation
    (i.e. cD&sequalcA may be expressed as cD&seqcA). In all cases the first argument
    is completely evaluated before the second argument. String logical
    operators include:-

    cD&sequalcA cCstr1cA cCstr2cA
    
       cGTRUEcA if the two strings cCstr1cA and cCstr2cA are the same. Abbreviated form
       of the function is cD&seqcA.

    cD&slesscA cCstr1cA cCstr2cA
    
       cGTRUEcA if string cCstr1cA alphabetically less than cCstr2cA. Abbreviated form of
       the function is cD&slecA.

    cD&sgreatcA cCstr1cA cCstr2cA
    
       cGTRUEcA if string cCstr1cA alphabetically larger than cCstr2cA. Abbreviated form
       of the function is cD&sgrcA.

    cD&isequalcA cCstr1cA cCstr2cA
    
       cGTRUEcA if the two strings cCstr1cA and cCstr2cA are the same ignoring letter
       case. Abbreviated form of the function is cD&isecA.

    cD&xsequalcA cCstr1cA cCregexcA
    
       cGTRUEcA if the string cCstr1cA matches the cCregexcA (case sensitive).
       Abbreviated form of the function is cD&xsecA. See lsRegularExpressions(2)lmRegular Expressionsle for
       information on the cCregexcA format.

    cD&xisequalcA cCstr1cA cCregexcA
    
       cGTRUEcA if the string cCstr1cA matches the cCregexcA (case insensitive).
       Abbreviated form of the function is cD&xiscA. See lsRegularExpressions(2)lmRegular Expressionsle for
       information on the cCregexcA format.

    Evaluation of the string logical operators are left to right, the leftmost
    argument is fully evaluated before the next argument. The operator
    ordering is prefix notation (see ls&add(4)lm&add(4)le for an example of prefix
    ordering).


cEEXAMPLE cA


    Test for variable ls$buffer-bname(5)lm$buffer-bname(5)le is equal to cG*scratch*cA:

sB
          !if &seq $buffer-bname "*scratch*"
              ...

sA
    The following example tests a character is in the range cGacA-cGzcA:

sB
          !if &not &and &sle %c "a" &sgr %c "z"
              ...

sA
    The following example inserts the string cGcGccAcA into the alphabetically order
    string list cD%test-listcA:

sB
          set-variable %test-list "|a|b|d|e|"
          set-variable %test-insert "c"

          set-variable #l0 1
          !while &and &not &seq &lget %test-list #l0 "" ...
                  ... &sle &lget %test-list #l0 %test-insert
              set-variable #l0 &add #l0 1
          !done
          set-variable %test-list &lins %test-list #l0 %test-insert

sA
    The first test on the cD!while &andcA conditional checks that the current item
    in the list is not an empty string (""). If it is the end of the list has
    been reached.

    The following example tests the current buffers file name for a ".c"
    extension:

sB
          !if &xse $buffer-fname ".*\\.c"
              ...

sA
    Note the cCcG\cAcA character is needed to protect the second cCcG.cAcA, i.e. so that
    it does not match any character and the second cCcG\cAcA is required as the
    string is first parsed by the macro interpreter which changes it to
    cGcG.*\.ccAcA which is then interpreted as a regex.

    cD&rsincA cCstr1cA cCstr2cA  
    cD&risincA cCstr1cA cCstr2cA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    These functions test for the existence of cCstr1cA in cCstr2cA, returning the
    position of the string in cCstr2cA or 0 if not found.

    The functions may all be abbreviated to their three letter abbreviation
    (i.e. cD&risincA may be expressed as cD&riscA). In all cases the first argument is
    completely evaluated before the second argument.

    cD&sincA cCstr1cA cCstr2cA
    
       Returns cG0cA if string cCstr1cA does not exists in string cCstr2cA. Otherwise the
       function returns the character position + 1 of the location of the
       first character of the first occurrence of cCstr1cA.

    cD&isincA cCstr1cA cCstr2cA
    
       Returns cG0cA if case insensitive string cCstr1cA does not exists in string
       cCstr2cA. Otherwise the function returns the character position + 1 of the
       location of the first character of the first occurrence of cCstr1cA.

    cD&rsincA cCstr1cA cCstr2cA
    
       Returns cG0cA if string cCstr1cA does not exists in string cCstr2cA. Otherwise the
       function returns the character position + 1 of the location of the
       first character of the last occurrence of cCstr1cA.

    cD&risincA cCstr1cA cCstr2cA
    
       Returns cG0cA if case insensitive string cCstr1cA does not exists in string
       cCstr2cA. Otherwise the function returns the character position + 1 of the
       location of the first character of the last occurrence of cCstr1cA.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The cD&sincA and similar functions are useful for two different purposes.
    Consider the following example, this utilizes cD&sincA in two different
    contexts. cG!while &not &sin @wc " \t\n"cA is a test for the end of the
    number, i.e. a white space character (cG<tab>cA, cG<SPACE>cA or cG<NL>cA).

    The invocation cGset-variable #l1 &isin @wc "0123456789abcdef"cA is subtly
    different. In this case the return value is used to convert the character
    to it's integer hex value by using the value returned by cD&isincA.

sB
          ;
          ; calc-hexnum
          ; Convert the sting from the current position in the buffer
          ; to a hexadecimal number.
          define-macro calc-hexnum
              forward-delete-char
              forward-delete-char
              set-variable #l0 0
              !while &not &sin @wc " \t\n"
                  set-variable #l1 &isin @wc "0123456789abcdef"
                  !if &not #l1
                      ml-write "Bad Hex number found"
                      !abort
                  !endif
                  set-variable #l0 &mul #l0 16
                  set-variable #l0 &add #l0 &sub #l1 1
                  forward-delete-char
              !done
              insert-string #l0
          !emacro

sA
    The cD&rsincA function is very similar to sin except the value return is the
    position of the last occurrence of the string in the given string instead
    of the first. This is particularly useful when extracting the path or file
    name from a complete file name. For example, given a UNIX style file name
    such as cG"/usr/local/bin/me"cA the path can be obtained using set-variable
    %path &lef %pathfile &rsin cG"/" %pathfilecA and the file name by using
    cGset-variable %file &rig %pathfile &rsincA `"/" %pathfile`

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD!jumpcA cCoffsetcA  
    cD!tjumpcA cCconditioncA cCoffsetcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    Flow can be controlled within a MicroEmacs 2009 macro using the cD!jumpcA
    directive. It takes as a numerical argument cCoffsetcA. The cCoffsetcA is a signed
    relative displacement, it may be a literal numeric value, a variable or an
    evaluated expression (see lsIntroduction to Variable Functions)lmVariable Functionsle. The displacement to jump
    starts from the current cD!jumpcA line. (i.e. cD0 gotocA) would loop forever as it
    jumps to itself). Negative cCoffsetcA branches backwards, positive cCoffsetcA
    forwards.

    A conditional relative branch, with a numerical displacement is specified
    using cD!tjumpcA. This has an additional argument cCconditioncA which is evaluated
    and if TRUE (Non-zero) then the branch is taken. The cCconditioncA may be a
    variable or an evaluated expression.

    cD!jumpcA and cD!tjumpcA are fast equivalents of ls!goto(4)lm!goto(4)le and ls!tgoto(4)lm!tgoto(4)le,
    respectively. cD!jumpcA should be used with care as these calls are source
    sensitive and unexpected results may be obtained if the cCoffsetcA's are
    specified incorrectly.


cEWARNING cA


    Comments are not counted as valid lines within the relative displacement,
    these are stripped out when the macro is loaded. When using a relative
    branch ensure that ONLY the cCcodecA lines are counted.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    For some seriously dirty macro tricks then the cD!jumpcA directive becomes
    very useful. The following example is taken from the cDMetriscA macro (which
    is packed with goodies if you can find time to work out what it does !!).
    The following example uses the random number generator ls$random(5)lm$random(5)le to
    generate a random number which scaled and used as a cD!jumpcA offset, thereby
    creating a cCswitchcA type statement.

    cD@s2cA - Last search's second group value  
    ...  
    cD@s9cA - Last search's nineth group value


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The search group variables cD@scAcCncA return the string matches of the last
    regular expression search i.e. lssearch-forward(2)lmsearch-forward(2)le (in lsmagic(2m)lmmagic(2m)le mode) or
    lssearch-buffer(2)lmsearch-buffer(2)le.

    cD@s0cA returns the whole of the matched string, cD@scAcCncA, cCncA = 1..9, returns the
    bracket matches corresponding to the group demarkation points indicated by
    cG\(cA and cG\)cA in the search regular expression.


cEDIAGNOSTICS cA


    An error is generated if an attempt is made to access these variables and
    the last search failed or the last search did not have the specified
    group.

    The value returned for an unused group, e.g. @s2 for the regex string
    cGcG\(a\)\|\(b\)cAcA if cGcGacAcA was matched, is an empty string ("").


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following macro code gives a simple example of their potential use:

sB
          forward-search "Token *{\\(Start\\|End\\)}"
          !if $status
              ml-write "[found \"%s\"]" @s0
              !if &seq @s1 "Start"
                 .
                 .

sA
cENOTES cA


    Remember that the regular expression escape character '\' has to be
    duplicated within a macro file as '\' is also the macro file escape
    sequence.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD@fscA cCrowcA cCcolumncA  
    cD@fsscA cCrowcA cCcolumncA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The frame store variable cD@fscA permits macros to obtain the character
    currently being drawn on the screen at the specified location. If the
    given value of cCrowcA or cCcolumncA is out range, i.e. less than zero or greater
    than or equal to the screen size (see ls$frame-width(5)lm$frame-width(5)le) then the value
    returned is the empty string (i.e. cG""cA).

    The frame store scheme variable cD@fsscA operates in the same way as cD@fscA but
    returns the hilighting scheme number as opposed to the character.

    These variables cannot be set and are only updated during a screen update,
    this means that macros that change the cursor position need to redraw the
    screen before using this variable (see lsscreen-update(2)lmscreen-update(2)le).


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example gets the word under the current mouse position, this
    may not be the current cursor position:

sB
          define-macro word-under-mouse
              set-variable #l0 $mouse-y
              set-variable #l1 $mouse-x
              !if &not &inw @fs #l0 #l1
                  ml-write "[mouse not over a word]"
                  !return
              !endif
              set-variable #l2 @fs #l0 #l1
              set-variable #l1 &sub #l1 1
              !if &inw @fs #l0 #l1
                  set-variable #l2 &cat @fs #l0 #l1 #l2
                  !jump -3
              !endif
              set-variable #l1 $mouse-x
              set-variable #l1 &add #l1 1
              !if &inw @fs #l0 #l1
                  set-variable #l2 &cat #l2 @fs #l0 #l1
                  !jump -3
              !endif
              ml-write &spr "[mouse is over the word \"%s\"]" #l2
          !emacro

sA
    Knowledge of the display scheme as returned by the cD@fsscA variable is a
    little more obscure than the previous example. This variable is currently
    used to determine if there is a spelling error under the cursor position.
    When lsauto-spell(3)lmauto-spell(3)le is enabled then spelling errors are hilighted in a
    different colour, return of the lshilight(2)lmhilightingle scheme allows the caller to
    determine that there is a spelling error at the current position, this
    could also be applied to collapsed regions etc. The following example is
    taken from cGmouseosd.emfcA to determine if there is a spelling error at the
    mouse position.

sB
          set-variable #l0 &band $mouse-pos 15
          !if &equ #l0   0
              ; Text window - must goto the original position or cut etc wont work - must dup the position

    &opt - MicroEmacs optional feature test


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD&optcA cCstrcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    This function can be used to test the availability of optional features in
    the current session of MicroEmacs. Some features, like spelling checker
    support, are a compilation option, other options like mouse support may
    also be unavailable on some platforms. The cD&optcA function can be used by
    macros to check that required base functionality is available.

    The function returns cG1cA in the given feature "cCstrcA" is supported, otherwise
    it returns cG0cA if the feature is unknown or not supported in the running
    version.

cEcENAME cEcA


    @h0, @h1, @h2, ... @h4 - History Group Variables.


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD@h0cA cCindexcA - General history string  
    cD@h1cA cCindexcA - Buffer history string  
    cD@h2cA cCindexcA - Command history string  
    cD@h3cA cCindexcA - File history string  
    cD@h4cA cCindexcA - Search history string  


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The history group variables cD@hcAcCncA cCindexcA return the strings in the history
    buffer ad a given cCindexcA. There are 5 history buffers, cCncA, as follows:-

    cG0cA - General history string  
    cG1cA - Buffer history string  
    cG2cA - Command history string  
    cG3cA - File history string  
    cG4cA - Search history string  

    Each history buffer contains 20 slots which contain the history
    information. The history slot is selected with the cCindexcA argument which is
    valid in the range cG0..19cA, index cG0cA is the most recent history slot in the
    history group.

    The history slots are automatically modified on the entry of a new
    command, search string etc.

    cD@hcAcCncA cCindexcA returns the whole of the history string for a given slot.


cEDIAGNOSTICS cA


    An error is generated if an attempt is made to access these variables and
    history buffer identifier cCncA or the cCindexcA is out of range.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The last search history may be extracted as follows:-

sB
          set-variable #l1 @h4 0
          !force search-backward #l1
          !if &not $status

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD&bstatcA returns the specified cC<stat>cA on the current buffer. Valid cC<stat>cA
    values are:-

cEcENAME cEcA


    $auto-time - Automatic buffer save time
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$auto-timecA cCsecondscA; Default is cG300cA seconds

    0 <= cCsecondscA <= t


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    Sets the number of seconds to wait until an edited buffer is auto-saved to
    temporary file to t seconds. A setting of 0 disables the auto-saving
    command. Auto-saving can be enabled and disabled on a per buffer basis
    using buffer mode lsautosv(2m)lmautosv(2m)le.

    The auto-save file naming convention is the same as the backup name only
    using hash (cCcG#cAcA) instead of tilde (cCcG~cAcA) and is automatically removed on
    saving a buffer.

    On unlimited length file name systems (UNIX), the following file naming
    conventions are used for file cGxxxxxcA:

        `xxxxx -> xxxxx#`

    On systems with an cGxxxxxxxx.yyycA file name (DOS etc), the following file
    naming conventions are used:

        `xxxxxxxx     -> xxxxxxxx.###`
        `xxxxxxxx.y   -> xxxxxxxx.y##`
        `xxxxxxxx.yy  -> xxxxxxxx.yy#`
        `xxxxxxxx.yyy -> xxxxxxxx.yy#`
 

cENOTES cA


    The user is warned to be extra careful if files ending in cCcG~cAcA or cCcG#cAcAs are
    used, it is advisable to disable backup creation (see lsglobal-mode(2)lmglobal-mode(2)le) and
    auto-saving (cG$auto-time = 0cA). The author denies all responsibility (yet
    again) for any loss of data! Please be careful.

    Auto-save files of URL files (i.e. cGcGftp://...cAcA and cGcGhttp://...cAcA) are
    written to the system's temporary directory. This avoids potentially slow
    auto-saves. This can however lead to recovery problems as the buffer name
    must be used to avoid auto-saving conflict with other buffers with the
    same base file name but different paths.

    cCschemeNumcA is a color scheme defined with lsadd-color-scheme(2)lmadd-color-scheme(2)le, which
    identifies the foreground and background color schemes of the buffer. The

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    Sets the buffer create, delete, begin and end hook command which are
    executed:

    cDbuffer-fhookcA
    
       When the buffer is created.

    cDbuffer-dhookcA
    
       When the buffer is deleted.

    cDbuffer-bhookcA
    
       When the buffer becomes the current buffer.

    cDbuffer-ehookcA
    
       When the buffer is swapped out from being the current buffer.

    The variable cD$buffer-fhookcA is largely redundant as the file hook is
    executed only once and before it can be sent. Its main use is within
    macros which wish to ascertain what type of buffer it is executing on,
    i.e. if a command was to be executed only on c file then the follow
    ensures that this is the case:

sB
          !if &not &seq $buffer-fhook "fhook-cmode"
              !abort
          !endif

sA
    Where the command cCfhook-cmodecA is the c file hook.

    cDdhookscA are executed when a buffer is deleted, but before the contents of
    the buffer are lost. Note that dhooks will not be called if the buffer
    never becomes active, or if MicroEmacs 2009 quits due to the receipt of a
    panic signal.

    cDbhookscA and cDehookscA are usually used to set and restore global variables
    which require different setting in the current buffer.

    The order of The default settings of these variable are determined by the
    command lsadd-file-hook(2)lmadd-file-hook(2)le.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$buffer-bnamecA the string name of the current buffer. Buffer names are
    unrestricted in length, but must be unique. By default the buffer name is
    derived from the buffer's file name without the path. But this can lead to
    conflicts, caused by identical file names but different paths. In these
    situations a counter is appended to the end of the buffer name and is
    incremented until a unique buffer name is created. For example:

        File Name               Buffer Name
        _______________________________________
 
        /etc/file.c             file.c

    cD$buffer-hilightcA Sets the current buffer's hi-lighting scheme (see
    lshilight(2)lmhilight(2)le for a full description of hi-lighting). The default setting is
    0 which specifies no hi-lighting, when set to a non-zero, the hi-light
    scheme of that number MUST already be defined.

    Terminals that cannot display color directly may still be able to take
    benefit from hi-lighting. A terminal that has fonts can use them in the
    same way using the lsadd-color-scheme(2)lmadd-color-scheme(2)le command. The hi-light scheme is
    also used in printing (see lsprint-buffer(2)lmprint-buffer(2)le). If, however, your terminal
    cannot display color in any way, it is recommended that hi-lighting is
    disabled (except when printing) as it does take CPU time.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$buffer-maskcA cDstringcA; Default is cGluhcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$buffer-maskcA sets the current buffer word class mask. MicroEmacs 2009 has
    an internal word lookup table which defines whether a given letter is
    considered to be part of a word. This functionality is used in many areas
    such as lsforward-word(2)lmforward-word(2)le, lsforward-kill-word(2)lmforward-kill-word(2)le hilighting etc. The mask is
    composed with any combination of the following flags, the order in which
    the flags are specified is not important:

    cDlcA
    
       All lower case letters.

    cDucA
    
       All upper case letters.

    cDhcA
    
       All hexadecimal characters (used to include numerical digits).

    cDscA
    
       Spell extended characters, typically set to accent (cG'cA), hyphen (cG-cA) and
       period (cG.cA).

    cD1cA
    
       User set cD1cA, usually set to just underscore (cG_cA) for many system and
       programming files such as 'C'.

    cD2cA
    
       User set cD2cA, usually set to cCcG-cAcA, cCcG$cAcA, cCcG&cAcA, cCcG#cAcA, cCcG!cAcA, cCcG%cAcA, cCcG:cAcA and cCcG@cAcA
       for MicroEmacs files.

    cD3cA
    
       User set cD3cA, not usually defined.

    cD4cA
    
       User set cD4cA, not usually defined.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$cursor-blinkcA sets the cursor's flash rate, i.e. the period in which the
    cursor is drawn, hidden and then redrawn. The default setting of 0
    disables cursor blinking. When set to a none zero value the variable is
    split into two componants, the first 16 bits, or lower short, sets the
    cursor visible time in milliseconds, and the higher short sets the hidden
    time. If the hidden time is set to 0 then the cursor will be hidden for
    the same length of time it is visible.

    The cursor blink rate can be setup in the platform section of
    lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le.

    cD$cursor-colorcA sets the cursor's fore-ground color, and can greatly improve
    cursor visibility. cCcolorNumcA is a integer palette number created using
    lsadd-color(2)lmadd-color(2)le, the default is 0.

! 5 $debug
cEcENAME cEcA


    $debug - Macro debugging flag
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$debugcA cCdebugLevelcA; Default is cG0cA

    -3 <= cCdebugLevelcA <= 3


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$debugcA is used to control macro debugging, it is a bit based flag where:

    cG0x01cA
    
       Displays an error message when an un-handled exception is encountered,
       this is useful to locate problems in the macro code i.e. missing
       arguments etc. This setting may be used in normal running and macro
       execution is halted when an error is encountered, it is non-intrusive
       up until the point of failure. Enabling slightly slows execution but
       is not typically noticeable on modern processors.

    cG0x02cA
    
       Setting this bit enables the macro debugger. With macro debugging
       enabled, before a line of macro code is executed the line and its
       location is first print on the message line with a prompt allowing the
       user to view variables, abort execution, dive into sub macros etc. The
       behaviour of the macro debugger can be altered by bits cG0x04cA and cG0x08cA.

    cG0x04cA
    
       When set all macro lines encountered are printed. When this bit is not
       set only the lines of code that are executed are printed, i.e. if a
       false cD!ifcA was encountered the lines within the cD!ifcA would not be
       printed. Problems arise with cD!elifcA and cD!elsecA lines and this bit is not
       set as the cD!elifcA and cD!elsecA lines are never printed.

    cG0x08cA
    
       When set the debug prompt is disabled so the macro line is printed on
       the message line and then immediately executed. This allows the user
       to see the execution flow of the macro code while still executing the
       code at a reasonable pace.

    cG0x10cA
    
       Setting this bit has no immediate effect. However as soon as the key
       bound to lsabort-command(2)lmabort-command(2)le (typically cGcGC-gcAcA) is pressed the macro
       debugger is enabled, i.e. bit cG0x02cA is set. This can be invaluable when
       tracing problems, for example the following macro code will loop
       infinitely:-

sB
              !repeat
                  beginning-of-line
                  backward-char
                  !force forward-line
              !until &not $status

sA
       This is a fairly obvious bug, but if buried in a thousand lines of
       macro code it could be very difficult to spot and to find it during
       execution would be very tedious if not impossible. But by setting
       cD$debugcA to cG0x10cA the macro can be executed as normal and as soon as the
       macro is stuck the user can simply press cGcGC-gcAcA to start macro
       debugging at the current execution point.

       Note that the cGcGC-gcAcA which triggers the macro debugger is discarded so
       it does not cause the current command to abort.

    cG0x20cA
    
       Setting this bit is similar to cG0x10cA except the macro debugger is
       enabled by the ringing of the bell. When some commands fail they
       always print an error message and ring the bell as the error needs
       handling (e.g. missing argument in a cD!ifcA statement). However if the
       macro has been called with a cD!forcecA the execution will not be aborted
       so tracing this issue could be difficult without this setting.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    Sets the command line used to execute a cDgrep(1)cA system command. The output

    cDgrep(1)cA is typically used with the cD-ncA option which produced line numbering
    information which drives the lsget-next-line(2)lmget-next-line(2)le command.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example shows how the cDxgrepcA strings are defined.

sB
          set-variable %xgrep-com "grep -n "
          0 add-next-line "*grep*"
          add-next-line "*grep*" "%f:%l:"

sA
    This definition corresponds to a cDgrepcA output such as:-

        m5var000.5:13:Sets the  number of seconds to wait
        m5var000.5:14:temporary file to t seconds. A
        m5var000.5:15:Note than the  temporary
        m5var000.5:17:saving a buffer.  Backup  files are
        m5var000.5:24:On unlimited  length  file  name  systems


    where cDgrepcA produces file and line number information for every match.

    Use lsadd-next-line(2)lmadd-next-line(2)le to define the line pattern produced by cDgrepcA. Some
    versions of cDgrepcA place the file name on a single line matches within the
    file occur on subsequent lines. In this case additional cCadd-next-linecA
    patterns may be defined to cater for the cDgrepcA output as follows:

sB
          set-variable %xgrep-com "grep /n "
          0 add-next-line "*grep*"
          add-next-line "*grep*" "File: %f:"
          add-next-line "*grep*" "%l:"

sA
    This definition would be used with a cDgrepcA output such as:-

        File:m5var000.5:
        13:Sets the  number of seconds to wait
        14:temporary file to t seconds. A

cEcENAME cEcA


    $home - Users `home' directory location

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$homecA cCdirectorycA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$homecA contains the pathname of the users home directory. The file naming
    convention utilizes tilde (cCcG~cAcA) to identify the users home directory
    (cG$HOMEcA). When entering a file name:

        ~/xxx    -> $home/xxx
        ~yyy/xxx -> $home/../yyy/xxx


    On most systems this is automatically set to the environment variable
    "HOME" if it is defined. On systems (i.e. Microsoft Windows or MS-DOS)
    where there may be no home defined then the system user directory is used
    by default. The value may be explicitly redefined by the user in the
    start-up file to be a different location. If cD$homecA is re-defined then
    ensure that a trailing directory separator is included at the end of the
    pathname.

    cCcG~cAcA may be used in pathname definitions in the macro files, files but must
    be specified as cCcG~cAcA, it is perhaps better to use cD$homecA.

! 5 $scroll
cEcENAME cEcA


    $scroll - Screen scroll control
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cG$scrollcA cCscrollNumcA; Default is cG1cA  

    0 <= cCscrollNumcA <= n


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$scrollcA controls the horizontal and vertical scrolling method used to
    display long lines and buffers. The variable is split into two componants,
    the first nibble (cG0x0fcA) sets the horizontal scroll, and the second nibble
    (cG0xf0cA) sets the vertical. For the purpose of documentation these parts are
    kept separate, but when setting the variable a single combined value must
    be given.

    The horizontal settings are defined as follows:

    cG0x00cA
    
       Scroll method 0 will only scroll the current line, this is the fastest
       method in execution time.

    cG0x01cA
    
       Scroll method 1 (the default) will scroll the whole page horizontally
       when the lsscroll-left(2)lmscroll-left(2)le and lsscroll-right(2)lmscroll-right(2)le commands are used.
       However, when the current line must be scrolled to display the cursor
       due to a lsforward-char(2)lmforward-char(2)le type cursor movement, only the current line
       is scrolled and the rest are reset.

    cG0x02cA
    
       Scroll method 2 always scrolls the whole page horizontally, keeping
       the cursor in the current column range. If the cursor moves out of
       this range then all the page is scrolled to the new position. This is
       particularly useful when editing long lined tables.

    cG0x03cA
    
       Scroll method 3 fixes the scroll column using the cDscroll-leftcA and
       cDscroll-rightcA functions. If the current cursor position is not visible
       in the column range then only the current line is scrolled to the new
       position.

    The vertical settings are defined as follows:

    cG0x00cA
    
       Scroll method 0 (the default) will scroll the current line to the
       middle of the current window whenver it is moved off screen, this is
       the fastest method in execution time.

    cG0x10cA
    
       Scroll method 1 will scroll the current line to the the top of the
       window whenver the current line is moved off the screen using
       lsbackward-line(2)lmbackward-line(2)le and to the bottom of the window when lsforward-line(2)lmforward-line(2)le
       is used. This creates the effect of a smooth scroll.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example sets the scrolling method to be the default
    horizontally (cG0x01cA) and smooth method (cG0x10cA) vertically :

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDfill-colcA variables specify the text justification modes for text
    filling of lsfill-paragraph(2)lmfill-paragraph(2)le.

    cD$fill-modecA defines the global default justification mode i.e.
    cCleftcA/cCrightcA/cCbothcA/... The default value is cCnonecA cCautomaticcA (cDNcA). The modes
    available are:-

    cDbcA Both
    
       Enables left and right margin justification.

    cDccA Center
    
       Enables center justification.

    cDlcA Left
    
       Enables left justification.

    cDncA None
    
       No filling is performed, adjacent lines are not merged into a single
       line. This subtly different from cCleftcA justification which fills lines
       to the ls$fill-col(5)lm$fill-col(5)le.

    cDocA One Line
    
       Enables the filling of the paragraph to a single line. Typically used
       to prepare a file for transfer to a word processing package.

    cDrcA Right
    
       Enables right justification.

    cDBcA Both (automatic)
    
       Automatically determines the mode, defaulting to left and right (both)
       justification.

    cDCcA Center (automatic)
    
       Automatically determines the mode, defaulting to center justification.

    cDLcA Left (automatic)
    
       Automatically determines the mode, defaulting to left justification.

    cDNcA None (automatic)
    
       Automatically determines the mode, defaults to cCbothcA and not cCnonecA.

    cDRcA Right (automatic)
    
       Automatically determines the mode, defaulting to right justification.

    cD$buffer-fill-modecA specifies the fill mode value to use in a buffer, a
    value of cD$fill-modecA is used as a default when the buffer is created.
    Modification of the cD$buffer-fill-modecA causes the buffer fill mode to be
    modified, this does not affect any other buffer. The value is set by the
    cDfhook-xxxcA macro when initializing a buffer using the lslanguageTemplates(2)lmLanguage Templatesle.
    cD$buffer-fill-modecA may also be modified from lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le.

    The buffer lines are automatically justified only when the justification
    mode lsjustify(2m)lmjustify(2m)le is enabled. Justification is performed between the left
    and right margins, defined as 0 and ls$buffer-fill-col(5)lm$buffer-fill-col(5)le respectively.


cEAutomatic Filling  cA


    Automatic filling is performed when the mode cD$buffer-fill-modecA is
    specified in upper case. The format of the line (and adjacent lines) is
    interrogated and an cCinformedcA guess is made as to the expected formating
    which is then adopted. The criteria for automatic formatting is defined as
    follows:-

    cCcentercA
    
       If the left and right margins contain the same amount of white space
       +/-1 character then the paragraph is centered.

    cCrightcA
    
       If the text commences past half of the ls$buffer-fill-col(5)lm$buffer-fill-col(5)le (i.e. first
       half of the line comprises white space) AND the line extends to, or
       past, the cG$buffer-fill-colcA then the paragraph is assumed to be right
       justified.

    cCnonecA
    
       If the text commences in column 0 and occupies less than half of the
       line then the paragraph is assumed to be not justified. (i.e. left
       justified, but consecutive lines of the paragraph are not filled)

    cCdefaultcA
    
       If none of the above criteria are met then the default mode is
       adopted, as determined by the lower-case value of the
       cD$buffer-fill-modecA value.

    cD$platformcA is often used in cD.emfcA files to allow portability of macro files
    across platforms, allowing macro files to perform platform specific
    operations. ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le is also often used for this purpose as its value is
    easier to assess.

    cD%platformcA is created at start-up when cGme.emfcA is executed, its value is
    identical to cD$platformcA except when the platform is a console in which case
    a cCcGccAcA is appended to the $platform value, e.g. for MicroEmacs running a
    termcap version on LINUX the value will be cGcGlinuxccAcA. The variable is used
    when the console and window based versions need to be distinguish, e.g.
    some of the lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setuple settings.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example is taken from the cDme.emfcA file which uses the

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cG$randomcA cCintegercA  

    0 <= cCintegercA <= 65535  


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cD$randomcA variable returns a unique random number in the range 0 - cCncA on
    reference to the variable.

    The random number is derived from the system's random number generator
    (the quality of which is often dubious so try to avoid using the bottom
    bits). Setting this variable with any value resets the random sequence
    using the system time as the seed.

    The range of the random number generator is system dependent. The value is
    typically capped using the ls&mod(4)lm&mod(4)le arithmetic operator.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The variable may be assigned to generate a new seed as follows:-

sB
          set-variable $random 0        ; Set it so we get a new seed

sA
    The returned value is used with the cD&modcA operator to limit the value to a
    desired range:-

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    RCS (Revision Control System) and SCCS (Source Code Control System) are
    programmers source code history data-bases. RCS introduces a system in
    which only one programmer can edit a source file at any one time,
    enforcing some form of stability in the global environment. The fact that
    this interface was developed for the RCS system is irrelevant, and should
    be usable under any other control systems such as SCCS.

    When using RCS, finding a file (see lsfind-file(2)lmfind-file(2)le) checks for the existence
    of the actual file. If this is not found then it checks for the existence
    of an RCS cD$rcs-filecA variable, and if present then it constructs the RCS
    file name and checks for its existence. If this file does not exist then
    it really is a new file and an new buffer is created. If the file does
    exist then the file is checked out using the cD$rcs-co-comcA which executes to
    create a file with the original file name, ready for loading.

    cD$rcs-filecA is the name of the file when it is fully check in, as opposed to
    when it is ready to be viewed or edited. In RCS, this is usually in the
    cGRCScA directory with an appended cGcG,vcAcA, i.e. for the file cGfoo.ccA in the cG/testcA
    directory, when fully checked in, the file will not be found at
    cGcG/test/foo.ccAcA, but at cGcG/test/RCS/foo.c,vcAcA. When testing for an RCS file,
    the file name is split into two parts, the path name and the file name,
    the path is always inserted at the start, and the file name can inserted
    in the rcs string by using the special cGcG%fcAcA token, thus if cD$rcs-filecA is
    set to cGcGRCS/%f,vcAcA, the RCS file name is constructed from cGcG/test/cAcA + cGcGRCS/cAcA
    + cGcGfoo.ccAcA + cGcG,vcAcA.

    If the RCS file is found then the cD$rcs-co-comcA (RCS cDCcAheck cDOcAut cDCOMcAmand)
    which is a simple system command line with the exception for cG%fcA which is
    replaced by the file name, is executed. This is expected to create the
    file (with the correct file name) ready for viewing.

    Once a file is loaded, then the lsrcs-file(2)lmrcs-file(2)le command has one of two
    effects:-

       If the file is in view mode then the cD$rcs-cou-comcA (RCS cDCcAheck cDOcAut
       cDUcAnlock cDCOMcAmand) is executed (system command line using the "%f" as the
       file name). If the RCS file does not exist then is simply toggles the
       view mode, allowing editing.

       If the file is not in view mode MicroEmacs attempts to check the file
       back into RCS using either cD$rcs-ci-comcA (if the RCS file already
       exists) or the the cD$rcs-cif-comcA (RCS cDCcAheck cDIcAn cDFcAirst cDCOMcAmand). The cGcG%fcAcA
       is again used for the file name, the cGcG%mcAcA can also be used to get a
       comment from the user at check in time which will be inserted (without
       quotes) into the cD$rcs-ci-comcA command line. For example, one possible
       cD$rcs-ci-comcA setting is "`ci -m\"%m\" %f`" which uses the cDci(1)cA program
       with the cD-mcA option to give a check in message.

    If cDrcs-filecA is given a negative argument instead of checking in or out the
    current buffer's file it executes the command specified by cD$rcs-ue-comcA to
    unedit or abort any changes made to the file. After the command has been
    executed the file is reloaded.


cENOTES cA


    The RCS variables are by default undefined and must be explicitly enabled
    in the start-up files.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following are typical variable definitions for the RCS interface:-

sB
          set-variable $rcs-file     "RCS/%f,v"
          set-variable $rcs-co-com   "co %f"
          set-variable $rcs-cou-com  "co -l %f"
          set-variable $rcs-ci-com   "ci -u -m\"%m\" %f"

sA
    Note that the cD$rcs-cif-comcA variable is usually left unassigned and
    cD$rcs-ci-comcA is used by default.

    The following are typical variable definitions for the SCCS interface:-

sB
          set-variable $rcs-file     "SCCS/s.%f"
          set-variable $rcs-co-com   "sccs get %f"
          set-variable $rcs-cou-com  "sccs edit %f"
          set-variable $rcs-ci-com   "sccs delget -y\"%m\" %f"
          set-variable $rcs-ci-com   "sccs create %f"
          set-variable $rcs-ue-com   "sccs unedit %f"

sA
    The following variable definitions can be used for MicroSoft's Visual
    Source Safe:-

sB
          set-variable $rcs-file    "%f"
          set-variable $rcs-cou-com "ss.exe checkout %f"
          set-variable $rcs-co-com  "ss.exe checkout %f"
          set-variable $rcs-ci-com  "ss.exe checkin %f \"-c%m\""

sA
    The above definitions can check a file out for edit and commit changes
    back.

    visible. The value returned is in the range 3 - cCncA, cCncA is system dependent
    but no greater than 400.

    cD$frame-widthcA identifies the width of the current frame as the number of
    character columns. The value returned is in the range 8 - cCncA, cCncA is system
    dependent but no greater than 400.


cENOTES cA


    The name of these variables changed from cD$screen-depthcA and cD$screen-widthcA

$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$mouse-poscA cCintegercA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$mouse-poscA is generated by invocation of the command
    lsset-cursor-to-mouse(2)lmset-cursor-to-mouse(2)le. The variable is set to a value that indicates the
    position of the mouse within a window. The values to the mouse
    intersection are interpreted as follows:-

    cD0 - Text areacA
    
       Intersection with the window text area.

    cD1 - Message LinecA
    
       Intersection with the message line.

    cD2 - Mode LinecA
    
       Intersection with the mode line.

    cD3 - Horizontal SeparatorcA
    
       Intersection with the horizontal window separator. This value is only
       set if a scroll bar is not present.

    cD4 - Up ArrowcA
    
       Intersection with the scroll bar up-arrow character.

    cD5 - Upper ShaftcA
    
       Intersection with the scroll bar upper shaft (above the scroll box).

    cD6 - Scroll BoxcA
    
       Intersection with the scroll bar scroll box.

    cD7 - Lower ShaftcA
    
       Intersection with the scroll bar lower shaft (below the scroll box).

    cD8 - Down ArrowcA
    
       Intersection with the scroll bar down-arrow character.

    cD9 - CornercA
    
       Intersection with the window corner, that is the character at the
       intersection of the scroll bar (or separator) and the mode line.

    cD10 - Menu LinecA
    
       Intersection with the menu line.

    cD255 - ErrorcA
    
       The position of the mouse could not be determined. This value should
       not arise, if it does then it is an indication that the window
       structure is probably corrupted. A lsdelete-other-windows(2)lmdelete-other-windows(2)le is
       suggested or rapid exit from the editor after a lssave-some-buffers(2)lmsave-some-buffers(2)le
       command to save any edits (latter option is preferred).

    cDBit 4 - 2nd ColumncA
    
       Bit 4 (16) is set if 2 character column scroll bar or vertical window
       separator is in effect and the cursor exists in the second column This
       value is bitwise OR'ed with the aforementioned intersection values.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$statuscA contains the return status of the last command executed (cGTRUEcA or
    cGFALSEcA). cD$statuscA is generally used with the ls!force(4)lm!forcele directives in macros.


cENOTES cA


    This variable can not be set, any attempt to set it will result in an
    error.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example shows how the variable is used within a macro
    construct, it converts all tab characters to their SPACE equivalent.

sB
          ;
          ; tabs-to-spaces.
          ; Convert all of the tabs to spaces.
          define-macro tabs-to-spaces
              ; Remember line
              set-variable #l0 $window-line
              beginning-of-buffer
              !force search-forward "\t"
              !while $status
                  set-variable #l1 $window-acol
                  backward-delete-char
                  &sub #l1 $window-acol insert-space
                  !force search-forward "\t"
              !done
              goto-line #l0
              screen-update
              ml-write "[Converted tabs]"
          !emacro

sA
    In this case cD$statuscA monitors the lssearch-forward(2)lmsearch-forwardle command which is
    searching for a tab character. The command returns a status value of cGTRUEcA
    if a tab is found, otherwise cGFALSEcA.

    The cD!forcecA statement prevents the macro from terminating when a cGFALSEcA
    condition is detected, if omitted the macro would terminate with an error
    as soon as the cGFALSEcA status is encountered. The definition of
    lstabs-to-spaces(3)lmtabs-to-spaces(3)le can be found in format.emf.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$tab-widthcA cCintegercA; Default is cG8cA  

    -0 < cCintegercA <= cCncA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$tab-widthcA defines the default width of a tab character specified in
    spaces. The default value is used when new files are loaded and created
    and seeds the variable ls$buffer-tab-width(5)lm$buffer-tab-width(5)le.

    Setting tabs to arbitrary widths is possible in MicroEmacs 2009 but you
    must be aware of a subtle difference that it makes to your file and hence
    to your editing. When you start MicroEmacs 2009, the tab width is set to
    the default (usually every 8th column) for the tab character (cGCTRL-IcA). As
    long as you stay with the default, every time you insert the tab
    character, a CTRL-I get inserted. Hence, you logically have a single
    character which might appear to be several spaces on the screen (or the
    output) depending upon the column location of the tab character. This
    means that to remove the spacing you have to delete a cCsinglecA character --
    the tab character.

    On the other hand, the moment you explicitly set the tab interval (even if
    it is to the default value), MicroEmacs 2009 handles the tab character by
    expanding the character into the required number of spaces to move you to
    the appropriate column. In this case, to remove the spacing you have to
    delete the appropriate number of spaces inserted by M-e to get you to the
    right column.

    The operating mode of the tab expansion is controlled by the lstab(2m)lmtab(2m)le mode.


cENOTES cA


    The November 2004 version of MicroEmacs removed the existing variables
    cD$tabwidthcA and cD$tabsizecA which were ambiguous. The existing variable scope
    was global which caused problems when moving to buffers with different tab
    width properties. The variables have been replaced with cD$tab-widthcA and
    ls$buffer-tab-width(5)lm$buffer-tab-width(5)le. The indentation which was previously controlled by
    the tab width has been replaced with ls$indent-width(5)lm$indent-width(5)le and

    -0 < cCintegercA <= cCncA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$buffer-tab-widthcA defines the width of a tab character in terms of
    displayable spaces, a tab character is typically 8 spaces. A tab character
    appearing in a buffer is rendered with up to cD$buffer-tab-widthcA spaces to
    take it to the next column boundary of modulo cD$buffer-tab-widthcA.

    Modification of the variable value causes the displayed tab width to
    change to the new value. The macro lstabs-to-spaces(3)lmtabs-to-spaces(3)le may be used to
    convert all tabs to spaces.

    When a buffer is created (file loading or creation) then the default value
    is taken from the ls$tab-width(5)lm$tab-width(5)le variable.


cENOTES cA


    The indentation of a buffer is controlled by the ls$buffer-indent-width(5)lm$buffer-indent-width(5)le
    and not the cD$buffer-tab-widthcA when automatic lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le is enabled.

    The November 2004 version of MicroEmacs removed the existing variables
    cD$tabwidthcA and cD$tabsizecA which were ambiguous. The existing variable scope
    was global which caused problems when moving to buffers with different tab
    width properties. The variables have been replaced with ls$tab-width(5)lm$tab-width(5)le and
    cD$buffer-tab-widthcA. The indentation which was previously controlled by the
    tab width has been replaced with ls$indent-width(5)lm$indent-width(5)le and
    ls$buffer-indent-width(5)lm$buffer-indent-width(5)le.

    cD%tag-templatecA "cCstringcA"  
    cD%tag-optioncA "cCstringcA"  


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cD%tag-filecA and cD%tag-templatecA variables must be defined for lsfind-tag(2)lmfind-tag(2)le
    to work, they define the information required to locate tag references.

    cD%tag-filecA is the name of the tag file to be used, usually set to "cDtagscA".
    cD%tag-templatecA is a regular expression search string used to identify tags
    in a tag file. For example, a tag usually consists of a name cGcG%[^\t]cAcA
    followed by a tab cGcG\tcAcA followed by the file name that contains the
    function cGcG%[^\t]cAcA followed by another tab, followed by the search string
    and end of line cGcG%[^\n]\ncAcA, i.e.

sB
          set-variable %tag-template  "%[^\t]\t%[^\t]\t%[^\n]\n"

sA
    This would match a cDvi(1)cA tag string definition, as created by the UNIX
    utility cDctags(1)cA. The tags file typically contains entries such as:-

        $auto-time    m5var000.5 /^.XI $auto-time - "Automatic buffer"$/
        $buffer-bhook m5var002.5 /^.XI $buffer-bhook - "Buffer macro"$/
        $buffer-ehook m5var002.5 /^.XI $buffer-ehook - "Buffer macro"$/


    The cDtag-templatecA definition is modified to match the output of the
    cDctags(1)cA utility. The format of the tags file may differ from platform to
    platform, typically the differences are encountered in the line contents
    field which is usually defined as cG/ .... /cA for a forward search tag and ?
    .... ? for a reverse search tag. Note that a tag's search string typically
    starts with the character cCcG^cAcA and ends with cCcG$cAcA which indicate the start
    and end of the line. The variable fields are expected to be in
    conventional order of cClabelcA, cCfilenamecA and cClineTextcA.

    cD%tag-optioncA is a user defined variable that modifies the behavior of
    lsfind-tag(2)lmfind-tag(2)le. This is defined as a string, where each character identifies
    an option, when undefined then default behavior is assumed. The options
    are defined as:-

    cDmcA - Enable multiple tags support
    
       Allows a single tag to be present multiple times in the tag file,
       typically used when a function is defined multiple times. When enabled
       cDfind-tagcA can be used to loop through all definitions of a given tag.

    cDrcA - recursive tags file
    
       By default, the cDtagscA file is assumed to reside in the current
       directory location. The cDrcA option enables an ascending search up the
       directory hierarchy from the current directory position in search of a
       recursively generated tags file.

    cDccA - Continue recursive tag search
    
       Used in conjunction with flag cDrcA; when not specified, the recursive
       searching of a tag stops at the first tag file found, regardless of
       whether the given tag was located in the found tag file. If this flag
       is given and the tag was not found in the first tag file, the
       recursive search continues. This allows local tag files to be created
       and regularly maintained, yet still being able to access a higher
       level tag file when required.

    Modifications to this variable should be made in the cCusercA.emf file, e.g.
    To enable multi recursive ascent tag searching define:-

sB
          set-variable %tag-option  "mrc"

sA
cENOTES cA


    Note that GNU Emacs uses it's own tag file format generated by cDetags(1)cA
    which does not contain the appropriate information to drive the MicroEmacs
    2009 cDfind-tagcA command.

    The above settings should support the extended version 2 tag file format
    which has an extra tag type field at the end of each line.

! 5 $timestamp
cEcENAME cEcA


    $timestamp - Time stamp string
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$timestampcA "cCstringcA"; Default is cGcG<%Y%M%D.%h%m>cAcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$timestampcA defines the file time-stamping string. MicroEmacs 2009 searches
    for, and modifies, the string to the current time and date whenever the
    file is saved (written to disk) and lstime(2m)lmtime(2m)le mode is enabled.

    Time stamp string is defined, by default, as cGcG<%Y%M%D.%h%m>cAcA. The first
    occurrence of the string in the file is up-dated with the time and date
    information when the buffer is written. The cD$timestampcA string may contain
    any text, and includes the following, magic characters escaped by a
    percentage (`cG%cA') character:-

        `D` - Day.
        `M` - Month.
        `Y` - Year.
        `h` - Hour.
        `m` - Minute.
        `s` - Second.

    The format string may be redefined into any format. The cCcG%cAcA character has
    to be delimited by another cCcG%cAcA if it is to be used in the text (i.e.
    cGcG%%cAcA).

    The year component (cG%YcA) may be a 2 or 4 digit string, depending whether it
    includes the century. When the time stamping searches for the cG%YcA component
    it searches for either variant and replaces appropriately.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The startup file may define the time stamp required as follows:-

sB
          set-variable $timestamp "Last Modified : %Y/%M/%D %h:%m:%s"

sA
    Time stamping is performed on the string :-

         Last Modified : 90/11/23 10:12:01


    Where the time stamp is modified according to the file (buffer) type then
    the time stamp string may be modified within the buffer hooks. This allows
    different files to utilize different time stamping strings. The following
    example shows how the entry and exit buffer hooks are defined to modify
    the string:

sB
          0 define-macro bhook-nroff
              set-variable .timestamp $timestamp
              ; Buffer specific time stamp string.
              set-variable $timestamp "[%Y/%M/%D %h:%m:%s]"
          !emacro
          0 define-macro ehook-nroff
              ; Restore the existing time stamp.
              set-variable $timestamp .bhook-nroff.timestamp
          !emacro

sA
    On entry to the buffer (buffer becomes current) the buffer hook
    cDbhook-nroffcA is executed which stores the current setting and then modifies
    the time stamp string. On exit from the buffer the buffer hook cDehook-nroffcA
    is executed restoring the time stamp string.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$window-mode-linecA stores the screen line of the current windows mode-line,
    where screen lines are counted from 0 at the top of the screen. Often used
    in conjunction with lsset-cursor-to-mouse(2)lmset-cursor-to-mouse(2)le and ls$mouse-y(5)lm$mouse-y(5)le to add more
    complex mouse functionality.

    cD$window-scroll-barcA stores the screen position of the right-hand horizontal
    window separator line or scroll-bar (see lssplit-window-horizontally(2)lmsplit-window-horizontally(2)le and
    ls$scroll-bar(5)lm$scroll-bar(5)le). A value of greater than ls$frame-width(5)lm$frame-width(5)le indicates that
    there is no right-hand separator column or scroll bar present. Often used
    in conjunction with ls$mouse-x(5)lm$mouse-x(5)le.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    In the following example the position of the mouse is checked to see if it
    is on the mode line of the window, if so then a different action is taken.

sB

    $system - System configuration variable
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$systemcA cCbitmaskcA; Default is system dependent


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cD$systemcA is used to define and configure the MicroEmacs environment, it
    is a bit based flag where:-

    cD0x001cA
    
       This bit is set if MicroEmacs is running in Console mode. On UNIX
       systems the default is to use X whenever possible, in which case this
       bit will be clear. If X is not used then a TERMCAP base interface is
       used instead and this bit will be set (see notes below on how to set
       which interface to use). On all other systems this bit will be clear.

    cD0x002cA
    
       If this bit is set then the current system supports definable RGB
       colors allowing any color to be created and used in a lsadd-color(2)lmcolor schemele.
       This bit cannot be set, typically Windows and UNIX X-Windows systems
       support this.

    cD0x004cA
    
       If this bit is set then the current system supports ANSI colors (8
       colors, black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan & white), bits
       0x002 and 0x004 are mutually exclusive. On UNIX systems if the TERMCAP
       interface is being used then this bit can be changed to (de)select the
       used of color. Many unix terminals do not support color so this should
       be set appropriately. On all other systems this bit cannot be changed
       and MS-DOS is currently the only other system to use ANSI colors.

    cD0x008cA
    
       If this bit is set then the current system supports Extended ANSI
       colors, brighter versions of the 8 ANSI colors doubling the number of
       colors available to 16. On UNIX systems if the TERMCAP interface is
       being used then this bit can be changed to (de)select the used of bold
       with color to create this extended color set for foreground colors.
       But many UNIX terminals do not support this use of color with the bold
       font so this should be set appropriately. On all other systems this
       bit cannot be changed and MS-DOS is currently the only other system to
       support this.

    cD0x010cA
    
       If this bit is set then the current system supports the use of fonts
       (bold, italic, light and underline). Whether these fonts can be
       successfully utilized depends upon the platform and the system font
       being used, for UNIX TERMCAP systems it will also depend on the
       terminal being used. This option is not supported on MS_DOS.

    cD0x020cA
    
       When this bit is set the cursor is always shown in OSD (main menu)
       dialogs, this helps to improve navigation of dialogs ion systems with
       limited colors.

    cD0x080cA
    
       This bit is set if the current system is a UNIX based system such as
       LINUX or HPUX. This bit cannot be altered, its use is within macros.

    cD0x100cA
    
       This bit is set if the current system is a Microsoft based system such
       as DOS or Windows '95. This bit cannot be altered, its use is within
       macros.

    cD0x200cA
    
       If this bit is set then the current system uses the concept of drives
       (i.e. cGc:/cA on DOS systems). This bit cannot be altered, its use is
       within macros.

    cD0x400cA
    
       If this bit is set then a DOS style cG8.3cA file naming system should be
       used (i.e. cGcGBBBBBBBB.XXXcAcA), otherwise an unlimited file name length is
       used. This effects the backup and auto-save file names generated by
       MicroEmacs, the bit can be altered on systems that support unlimited
       file name length.

    cD0x800cA
    
       If this bit is set then the current system supports and uses
       lsipipe-shell-command(2)lmipipe-shell-command(2)le when required. For systems such as DOS which
       cannot support ipipes, this bit will be clear and cannot be altered.
       For systems which do support ipipes, this bit can be cleared to
       disable their use.

    cD0x1000cA
    
       If this bit set, the then execution of the lstab(2)lmtab(2)le command (bound to
       cGtabcA) always checks and adjusts the indentation of the current line
       when the current buffer has an lsindent(2)lmindentationle method. If the bit is clear
       then the cGtabcA may only checks the indentation when the cursor is in
       column zero depending on the setting of bit cD0x200000cA.

    cD0x2000cA
    
       If this bit is set the main menu Alt hot-key bindings are enabled.
       These are dynamic bindings automatically generated from the main menu.
       Typically the first item in the main menu is cGcGFilecAcA with a hot key of
       'cCcCFcAcA', with this bit set cCcGA-fcAcA will open this menu item. Note that
       global and local key bindings override these. Also see bit cD0x4000cA.

    cD0x4000cA
    
       If this bit is set the Alt key acts as a lsprefix(2)lmprefix 1le modifier key. By
       default cCcGA-ncAcA is not bound, with this bit set the key is inferred to
       cC`esc n`cA which is bound to cDforward-paragraphcA. Note that global, local
       and menu hot-key bindings override these. Also see bit 0x2000.

    cD0x8000cA
    
       If this bit is set the lsundo(2)lmundole history is kept after a save allowing the
       lsundo(2)lmundo(2)le command to back-up changes beyond the last save. When clear
       the undo history is discarded after the buffer is saved.

    cD0x10000cA
    
       Enable box character rendering fix, supported on Win32 and XTerm
       interfaces only. Windows ANSI fonts and many XTerm ISO-8859-1 fonts do
       not have well formed box characters which are used by lsosd(2)lmosd(2)le and other
       commands to create a better looking interface. When this bit is
       enabled MicroEmacs traps the printing of characters with an ASCII
       value of less than 32 and renders them directly. Following is a table
       of supported characters, other characters in the range of cG0x00cA to cG0x1fcA
       not listed are rendered as a space:

              0x08

       Enables the client server, default is disabled (UNIX and Win32 NT or
       Win95+ platforms only). When enabled a hidden cGcG*server*cAcA buffer is
       created which monitors commands written to the server, the socket
       "cG/tmp/mesrvcAcDuidcA" on UNIX systems and the command input file
       "cD$TEMPcAcG/mecAcD$MENAMEcAcG.cmdcA" on Win32 systems. Commands can be written out
       using the command lsipipe-write(2)lmipipe-write(2)le while in the "*server*" buffer, the
       command is written to the same socket on UNIX systems and to the
       response file and response file "cD$TEMPcAcG/mecAcD$MENAMEcAcG.rspcA" on Win32
       systems. This functionality is used by the cD-mcA and cD-ocA lsme(1)lmcommand-linele
       options and by the lsmemsdev(1)lmMicroSoft DevStudiole interface.

       Enables the capture of the Alt space key (cGcGA-spacecAcA), default is
       enabled (Win32 platform only). In the Windows environment the Alt
       Space key is used to activate the main window's pull down menu at the
       top left. if this bit is set MicroEmacs captures this key and executes
       it as normal, thereby disabling this standard windows binding.

    cD0x80000cA
    
       Enables the drawing of visible white spaces, i.e. space, tab and
       new-line characters. When disabled (default) white spaces are drawn
       using spaces (cC` `cA) which means the user cannot distinguish between a
       tab and spaces or determine the last character of the line by merely
       looking at the display. When enabled MicroEmacs uses visible
       characters to draw the white spaces, the characters used are set with
       the variable ls$window-chars(5)lm$window-chars(5)le.

    cD0x100000cA
    
       Enables hiding MicroEmacs generated backup files. On Windows and Dos
       platforms the Hidden file attribute is used to hide the file, whereas
       on UNIX the backup file name is prepended with a cCcG.cAcA.

    cD0x200000cA
    
       If this bit set, the then execution of the lstab(2)lmtab(2)le command (bound to
       cGtabcA) checks and adjusts the indentation of the current line when the
       cursor is in column zero and current buffer has an lsindent(2)lmindentationle method.
       The setting of this bit has no effect if bit cD0x1000cA is set. If this
       and bit cD0x1000cA are clear then the cGtabcA will not check the indentation.

    cD0x400000cA
    
       When this bit is set the external clipboard (Windows & XTerm
       platforms) will never be set to empty, if the current yank buffer is
       the empty string the cut buffer will be set to a space (i.e. " ").
       This feature has been added to avoid problems with other software
       (e.g. cDexceed(1)cA which can crash if given an empty cut buffer).

    cD0x800000cA
    
       When this bit is set all use of the external clipboard (Windows &
       XTerm platforms) is disabled, this means that MicroEmacs will not
       attempt to retrieve or set the content of the system clipboard.

    cD0x1000000cA
    
       When this bit is set the cG-pcA or cG-PcA option was used on the command line
       (see lsme(1)lmme(1)le). This bit can be used by macros to determine how to
       function, see lsfiletype(3f)lmfiletype(3f)le for an example of its use.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The follow example works out the current buffer's backup file name using
    cD$systemcA to determine the naming system being used by MicroEmacs:-

sB
          set-variable #l0 &stat "a" $buffer-fname
          ; Is an 8.3 dos style naming system being used?
          !if &band $system 0x400
              !if &not &set #l1 &sin "." #l0
                  set-variable #l1 &cat #l0 ".~~~"
              !elif &gre &set #l1 &sub &len #l0 #l1 2
                  set-variable #l1 &cat &lef #l0 &sub &len #l0 1 "~"
              !else
                  set-variable #l1 &spr "%s%n" #l0 &sub 3 #l1 "~"
              !endif
          !elif $kept-versions
              set-variable #l1 &cat #l0 ".~0~"
          !else
              set-variable #l1 &cat #l0 "~"
          !endif

    The following macro can be used to toggle the visible drawing of white
    spaces:

sB
          define-macro toggle-visible-white-spaces
              set-variable $system &bxor $system 0x80000

cENOTES cA


    Most of the cD$systemcA functionality can be set using the lsuser-setup(3)lm$user-setup(3)le
    dialog.


cEUNIX X verses Termcap  cA


    By default, on X supporting systems MicroEmacs creates a new X window.
    This feature may be disabled in one of two ways:

    - The environment variable cG$TERMcA is set to cGcGvt...cAcA, in this case it is
            assumed that the machine is a server, and the host cannot support X.
    - The cG-ncA option is used on the command line (see lsme(1)lmme(1)le) to disable the
            windowing interface.

    If X is disabled then the cDtermcapcA interface is used instead, still
    allowing the use of colors through the ANSI standard, or the use of fonts
    (see bits cD0x004cA and cD0x008cA).

    X provides the following features over and above a cDtermcapcA based version
    of MicroEmacs 2009:

    - R,G,B style color creator giving access to up to 256 different
            colors for the ultimate hilighting schemes (see bit 0x002 and
            lsadd-color(2)lmadd-color(2)le).
    - Full mouse support, allowing user definable bindings to every mouse
            event (see lsglobal-bind-key(2)lmglobal-bind-key(2)le).
    - Copy from and pasting to X's selection buffer (see lsyank(2)lmyank(2)le).

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$window-colcA is defined as the current position of the cursor in the
    current line in the current window. Column zero is the left hand edge.
    This differs from cD$window-acolcA in that TAB and special characters only
    count for 1 character. cD$window-colcA is valid in the range 0 - cCncA.

    cD$window-acolcA is defined as the current column of the cursor in the current
    window. Column zero is the left hand edge. This differs from cD$window-colcA
    in that tab and special characters may not count for 1 character.

    cD$window-linecA is defined as the current buffer line number the cursor is on
    in the current window. Line numbering starts from 1. cD$window-linecA is valid
    in the range 1 - cCncA.

    cD$window-alinecA is identical to cD$window-linecA except when the current buffer
    contains narrowed out sections before the current line. In this case
    cD$window-linecA will be set to the line number without counting the number of
    lines in the narrow, whereas cD$window-alinecA will return the current line
    number including all lines narrowed out before it. When this variable is
    set, the line required may lie in a narrowed out section in which case the
    narrow is automatically removed. See lsnarrow-buffer(2)lmnarrow-buffer(2)le for more information
    on narrowing.

    cD$window-elinecA is the end line of the window, that is the line number of
    the last line of the buffer showing in the window. This is a useful value
    for mouse operations when the position of the mouse may be tested to
    ensure that the mouse position is within the valid text region of the
    buffer.

    cD$window-mark-linecA is the current buffer line number of the mark position
    of lsset-mark(2)lmset-mark(2)le in the current window. Line numbering starts from 1.
    cD$window-mark-linecA is valid in the range 1 - cCncA.

    cD$window-mark-colcA is the current buffer column of the mark position of
    lsset-mark(2)lmset-mark(2)le in the current window. Note that this is the actual column
    position in the line which may be different from the window column
    position as TAB and special characters only count as a single character.


cENOTES cA


    Variable cD$window-wcolcA was renamed to cD$window-acolcA in June 2000. Variable
    cD$window-wlinecA was also removed and a new variable cD$window-y-scrollcA
    introduced at this time. The following macro code can be used to calculate
    the value of the original cD$window-wlinecA variable:

    cD$window-mark-linecA and cD$window-mark-colcA first appeared in the 2006 release

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD%ftp-flagscA "[cGccA|cGscA|cGpcA]" ; Default is undefined.  
    cD%http-flagscA "[cGccA|cGscA|cGpcA]" ; Default is undefined.  


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cD%ftp-flagscA and cD%http-flagscA modify the behavior of the editor during
    FTP and HTTP file transfers, respectively. (see lsftp(3)lmftp(3)le and lsfind-file(2)lmfind-file(2)le).

    By default, the flags are disabled, the facilities outlined below are
    enabled by setting the variable in the user configuration. The flag values
    for both flags are defined as follows:-

    cDccA
    
       Create a console buffer (cG*ftp-console*cA for ftp, cG*http-console*cA for
       http) into which the FTP/HTTP command interactions with the remote
       server are logged.

    cDscA
    
       Show the console whenever a FTP/HTTP operation is performed. The
       console is popped into the display pane and shows the current
       interaction status.

    cDpcA
    
       Show the download progress within the console window (cCcG#cAcA for every
       2Kb downloaded)

    Typically the following flags are enabled in the cCusercA.emf file:-

sB
          set-variable %ftp-flags "csp"
          set-variable %http-flags "csp"

sA
    Once familiar with this facility the console pop-up becomes inconvenient
    and the flags are typically reduced to:-

sB
          set-variable %ftp-flags "cp"
          set-variable %http-flags "cp"

sA
    This disables the pop-up feature of the console. Enabling the limited flag
    set allows some post mortem debugging to be performed if anything goes
    wrong. The console buffers are manually selected when these flags are set.

    must be compiled in for Windows versions.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$scroll-bar-schemecA cCschemeNumcA; Default is cG1cA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    Sets the horizontal window scroll bar color scheme, assigning the
    foreground, background and selection colors which are used to render the
    vertical separator / scroll bars (see lsadd-color-scheme(2)lmadd-color-scheme(2)le). The separator
    is rendered in reverse video, i.e. the foreground color of the color
    scheme is used as the background color, and vice versa.

    The separator is rendered in the standard colors when the associated
    buffer is not active, and in the current color when the buffer is active.

    The scroll-bar is the window separator constructed by
    lssplit-window-horizontally(2)lmsplit-window-horizontally(2)le or when the scroll bars are enabled via

       buffer. Default is 'cCcC\cAcA'.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The cD$window-charscA is typically platform dependent, it's setting is
    determined by the characters available in character set of the hosting
    platform. MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows use an OEM font might use the
    following value:

         "=-#*%=\C^\xB1 \xB1\C_\CD==\C^\C^\xB1\xB1  \xB1\xB1\C_\C_\C[
         \CZ|\CQ\xB1 \xB1\CP\CD||\CQ\CQ\xB1\xB1  \xB1\xB1\CP\CP\C[
         \CZ x*  >\\.$$\\"


    This utilizes character-set specific characters to render some of the
    window components.


cENOTES cA


    ls$scroll-bar(5)lm$scroll-bar(5)le allows the scroll box to be rendered in reverse video

    cD$fill-bullet-lencA cClengthcA; Default is cG5cA  

    0 <= cClengthcA <= ls$fill-col(5)lm$buffer-fill-colle  


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$fill-bulletcA contains the set of characters which are classified as bullet
    markers for lsfill-paragraph(2)lmfill-paragraph(2)le. If these characters are encountered in the
    first cD$fill-bullet-lencA characters of the paragraph AND the character is
    followed by a cGSPACEcA or a cGtabcA character then the user is given the option
    to indent to the right of the bullet.

    cD$fill-bullet-lencA determines the maximum depth into the paragraph (in
    characters) the filling routines should search for a bullet character. The
    default value is 15. Note that the paragraph starts at the first non-white
    space character. e.g. to detect cG`xviii) `cA as a bullet then the bullet
    length must be set to at least 6 to detect the bullet character cGcG)cAcA.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    Examples of filled bullet paragraphs are shown as follows, based on the
    default cD$fill-bulletcA character set.

        a) This is an  example of a  fill-paragraph.  The  closing
             bracket is classified as a bullet character and filling
             optionally takes place to the right of the bullet.

        a] Another paragraph

        -  A bullet paragraph

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$fill-ignorecA describes a set of characters used by lsfill-paragraph(2)lmfill-paragraph(2)le which
    disable paragraph filling when they appear at the start of a paragraph. An

cEcENAME cEcA


    $scroll-bar - Scroll bar configuration
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$scroll-barcA "cCbitmaskcA"; Default is platform specific


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$scroll-barcA defines the configuration of the scroll bar and/or the
    horizontal window separator for both main text windows and lsosd(2)lmosd(2)le dialogs.
    The variable is interpreted as a bit mask and defines which components of
    the scroll bar (or separator) should be rendered in a window. The
    characters used to render the scroll bar or separator are defined by
    ls$window-chars(5)lm$window-chars(5)le. The bit mask is defined as follows:-

    cD0x001cA - Vertical Scroll Bar Width
    
       Bit 0 controls the width of the vertical scroll bar (or separator). A
       value of 0 corresponds to a single column width, a value of 1 is a
       double column width.

    cD0x002cA - Upper end cap
    
       Bit 1 set indicates that the scroll bar has an upper end cap. This is
       the up arrow character at the top of a scroll bar.

    cD0x004cA - Lower end cap
    
       Bit 2 set indicates that the scroll bar has a lower end cap. This is
       the down arrow character at the bottom of a scroll bar.

    cD0x008cA - Corner
    
       Bit 3 set indicates that separate corner character is used at the
       intersection of the mode line and the separator.

    cD0x010cA - Scroll Box Enable
    
       Bit 4 determines if the scroll bar has a scrolling box, when the bit
       is set each scroll bar will have a scroll box. When clear, scroll bars
       are rendered according to bits 0-3 & 7 only and the main area of the
       bar is left empty.

    cD0x020cA - Reverse Video Box
    
       Bit 5 when set enables the scroll box to be rendered in reverse video,
       that is the background and foreground/hilight scroll colors are
       interchanged. This bit is typically set on X-Window platforms allowing
       the scroll box to comprise of cGSPACEcA characters allowing a solid box to
       be rendered in the foreground color.

       Bit 5 is only enacted if scroll boxes are enabled.

    cD0x040cA - Horizontal Scroll Bar Width
    
       Bit 6 controls the width of the horizontal scroll bar, used only by
       lsosd(2)lmosd(2)le. A value of 0 corresponds to a single column width, a value of
       1 is a double column width.

    cD0x080cA - Splitter
    
       Bit 7 set indicates that the scroll bar has a splitter. This is the
       split bar character at the top of a scroll bar.

    cD0x100cA - Enable window Scroll Bars
    
       When Bit 8 is clear, scroll bars are not present on windows. If a
       horizontal split has been performed then the window separator is
       rendered plain. This is useful when performance is important, as
       scroll bars require constant up-date.

    cD0x200cA - Horizontal Scroll Bar Width
    
       Bit 9 enables scroll bars, when the bit is set each window is assigned
       a scroll bar in the right-hand column(s) of the window with a scroll
       box.

$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$line-schemecA cCschemeNumcA; Default is cG-1cA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$line-schemecA sets the color scheme to be used for the current line of the
    current window. The given cCschemeNumcA can be any scheme number previously
    defined by the function lsadd-color-scheme(2)lmadd-color-scheme(2)le.

    A line's $line-scheme setting is removed by setting the variable to -1.

    A $line-scheme setting takes precedence over the buffer's color scheme (
    ls$buffer-scheme(5)lm$buffer-scheme(5)le) and the buffer's hilighting scheme (
    ls$buffer-hilight(5)lm$buffer-hilight(5)le).


cEEXAMPLE cA


    lsc-hash-eval(3)lmc-hash-eval(3)le greys out lines of text by doing:

sB
          set-variable $line-scheme %lblack

sA
    The lines are rest by doing

sB
          set-variable $line-scheme -1

sA
    The lsgdb(3)lmgdb(3)le interface hilights the current line of source by doing:

sB
          set-variable $line-scheme %yellow-lblack

sA
cENOTES cA


    Due to line storage restrictions, only 15 different color schemes can be
    used in a buffer at any one time. When the 16th color scheme is used it
    replaces the first color scheme, all lines using the first color scheme
    will be colored using the new color scheme.

    $search-path - MicroEmacs search path


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$search-pathcA cCstringcA  

    cC[Microsoft Windows/MS-DOS]cA  
    cD$search-pathcA cC<path1>cB;cDcA<path2>cA;cD....cA;cAcC<pathn>cA

    cD$search-pathcA cC<path1>cB:cDcA<path2>cA:cD....cA:cAcC<pathn>cA  


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$search-pathcA is automatically determined by MicroEmacs when it
    initializes. The variable identifies the directory paths which are
    searched to locate editor specific files. The variable may contain
    multiple search paths each separated by the platform path separator
    (semi-colon ('_cC;cA_') on Microsoft Windows or MS-DOS environments and a colon
    ('_cC:cA_') on UNIX environments). Where multiple search paths are defined then
    they are searched in a left to right order.

    cD$search-pathcA is determined at run-time and is fixed once the editor
    starts. The value of the search path is determined from a number of
    different sources in a platform specific manner as follows:-

    - Built in pathnames - On UNIX platforms then preset search paths are
          built into the executable i.e. /opt/jasspa, /usr/local/jasspa etc.
    - The users home directory, taken from the cG/etc/passwdcA under UNIX and
          from the shell environment under Microsoft Windows.
    - The location of the executable, typically only used under Microsoft
          Windows and MS-DOS environments where the concept of standard
          installation locations is vague.
    - The environment variable ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le which identifies the
          preferred user directory location, overriding any home directory
          location specified by the system.
    - The environment variable ls$MEINSTALLPATH(5)lm$MEINSTALLPATH(5)le which identifies the
          installation directory of the standard macros overriding any built
          in search path(s).
    - The environment variable ls$MEPATH(5)lm$MEPATH(5)le which absolutely overrides any
          search paths with a user defined path where ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le is not
          defined.
    - The command line option cD-ucA cCuser-namecA to lsme(1)lmme(1)le which overrides the
          user name found by the system.
    - The environment variable ls$MENAME(5)lm$MENAME(5)le which overrides the user name
          found by the system.

    The search paths are generally ordered from highest priority to lowest
    priority and typically arranged in the order:-

       cD$search-path=cA_<user>cC:cA<company>cC:cA<me>_

    where cC<user>cA represents the users path(s); cC<company>cA is the company file
    path(s) (e.g. company wide template files) and cC<me>cA path(s) which contain
    the standard MicroEmacs 2009 files.

    This would correspond to a typical directory installation, of user cDfoocA on
    UNIX such as:

 `/usr/foo/.jassa          `- User files.  
 cG/usr/local/jasspa/companycA - Company wide files  
 `/usr/local/jasspa/macros `- MicroEmacs installation directory  


cEUSAGE cA


    The current working directory is always checked first for the location of
    any file.

    cD$search-pathcA is used to locate all macro files, and other files located
    with operators such as ls&find(4)lm&find(4)le.

    Users should not modify this variable directly, the external
    aforementioned environment variables should be used to affect any desired
    changes.


cENOTES cA


    The search path operation was revised in the MicroEmacs 2004 release and
    operates differently from earlier releases.

    $file-ignore - File extensions to ignore
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$file-ignorecA "cCstringcA"; Default is ""


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$file-ignorecA specifies a space separated list of file endings which the
    file completion is to ignore. This is used by any function which prompts
    the user for a file name, such as lsfind-file(2)lmfind-file(2)le. A file ending in this case
    is NOT the extension but the last cCncA characters where cCncA is the number of
    characters in the specified ignore file.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    To ignore all files which have the extension cGcGocAcA, using:

sB
          set-variable $file-ignore "o"

sA
    would not only ignore cGcGfoo.ocAcA, but also cGcGfoo.oocAcA, cGcGfoo.pocAcA and cGcGfoocAcA as
    well as any file that ends in an cGcGocAcA. What is really required is

sB
          set-variable $file-ignore ".o"

sA
    It is useful to ignore the cGcG./cAcA and cGcG../cAcA directories so that a directory
    containing one file will auto-complete to that one file. This is achieved
    by using:

sB
          set-variable $file-ignore "./"

sA 
    To ignore MicroEmacs 2009 backup files (cGcG~cAcA), C object files (cGcG.ocAcA), cGcG./cAcA
    and cGcG../cAcA directories try using:

sB
          set-variable $file-ignore "~ .o ./"

sA
cENOTES cA


    The file completion only completes further than the first non-unique point
    in the current list of possibles if and only if it can ignore all but one
    file, so if the current directory contains:

         ./ ../ foo foo.c foo.c~ foo.o


    using the above ignore list, completing with "" has no effect as cGcGfoocAcA and
    cGcGfoo.ccAcA cannot be ignored; completing with cGcGfoo.cAcA will however complete to
    cGcGfoo.ccAcA.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$show-regioncA cCflagcA; Default is cG1cA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$show-regioncA enables or disables the current region hilighting, normally
    associated with mouse interaction in a buffer. Region hilighting occurs
    between the cCmarkcA (see lsset-mark(2)lmset-mark(2)le) and cCpointcA (current cursor) positions
    within the current buffer. An argument cCncA of 0 disables region hilighting,
    an argument of 1 enables region hilighting between the two positions. If
    it is set to 3 then region hilighting will be enabled and a defined region
    (created using lscopy-region(2)lmcopy-region(2)leor lsyank(2)lmyank(2)le) will continue to be hilighted
    until the region is changed.

    A defined region can be redisplayed (if still valid) using the command
    lsshow-region(2)lmshow-region(2)le. The color of the region hilighting is defined by
    lsadd-color-scheme(2)lmadd-color-scheme(2)le and is determined by ls$buffer-scheme(5)lm$buffer-scheme(5)le,

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$buffer-fmodcA is bit based variable setting the buffers file system modes
    or attributes. If the buffer was loaded from an existing file then the
    value of cD$buffer-fmodcA is taken directly from the file. But if the buffer
    was created then the buffer inherits the default file modes, cD$global-fmodcA,
    which is determined from the users umask on UNIX or a default on others.

    The definition of the file mode bits are platform specific and are
    considered independently, as follows:


cEUNIX  cA


    The file modes of Unix are the standard read, write and execute
    permissions for user, group and global. See cDchmod(1)cA for a full
    description of their use and effect.

    The variable is displayed in octal.


cEMicrosoft Windows and DOS  cA


    On Microsoft platforms each file attribute (see cDattrib(1)cA) is assigned a
    bit, on windows 95 and NT the new file attributes such as compressed are
    also represented. The bits are assigned as follows

        Bit     Attrib Flag     Attribute
        0x001       R           Read Only

    cD$delay-timecA sets the time waited between the user picking a mouse button

    When user presses the left button (say) a cGmouse-pick-1cA key event is
    generated, If this key is bound then the command it is bound to is
    executed. If the user then holds down the button for cD$delay-timecA or more
    milliseconds then MicroEmacs checks the binding of the special
    cGmouse-time-1cA key, if this pseudo key is bound then the command it is bound
    to will be executed.

    If the user continues to hold down the button for a further cD$repeat-timecA
    milliseconds another cDmouse-time-1cA key event will be generated. A
    cDmouse-time-1cA key event will be generated after every cD$repeat-timecA

    Care must be taken to ensure that a recursive loop is not created,
    consider the following example:-

sB

sA
    If this was executed MicroEmacs would very quickly crash! As soon as a
    second past cDboredcA would execute, which will prompt the user and wait for
    input. If a second passes without input cDboredcA will be executed again and
    again and again until stack memory runs out! To avoid this cGidle-pickcA
    should be unbound before waiting for user input, i.e.:-

sB
          define-macro bored
              global-unbind-key idle-pick
              !if &iseq @mc1 "Are you bored (y/n)? " "nNyY" "y"

cEcENAME cEcA


    $mouse - Mouse configuration variable
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$mousecA cCbitmaskcA; Default is system dependent


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cD$mousecA is used to define and configure the MicroEmacs mouse support,
    it is a bit based flag where:-

    cD0x00fcA
    
       Defines the number of button the mouse has, only values 1, 2 & 3 are
       useful. By default MicroEmacs uses the system information to determine
       the number of buttons on the mouse, this is not fool proof so the user
       can set these bits to the appropriate number if the initial value is
       incorrect.

    cD0x010cA
    
       If set the mouse is enabled, if clear the mouse will not function. On
       systems which do not support mice (such as UNIX Termcap) this bit will
       be clear and can not be altered.

    cD0x020cA
    
       If set the buttons are reversed, i.e. the left button becomes the
       right and vice versa. By default this bit is clear.

    cD0xf0000cA
    
       Defines the current mouse icon to used, valid values are as follows:

              0x00000 - Set mouse to default icon.
              0x10000 - Set mouse to arrow icon.
              0x20000 - Set mouse to text I-beam icon.
              0x30000 - Set mouse to crosshair icon.
              0x40000 - Set mouse to the grab icon.
              0x50000 - Set mouse to the wait icon.
              0x60000 - Set mouse to the stop icon.

       This feature is not supported on some systems and on others some icons
       are not obvious due to platform limitations.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example checks that the mouse is currently available, if
    not, it aborts.

sB
          !if &not &band $mouse 0x10
              ml-write "[Mouse support is not currently available]"

! 5 $kept-versions
cEcENAME cEcA


    $kept-versions - Number of backups to be kept
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$kept-versionscA cCintegercA; Default is 0

    0 <= cCintegercA <= n


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$kept-versionscA allows the user to specify the number of backup versions
    that are required for each file. For file cGcGXXXXcAcA, each backup version is
    renamed to cGcGXXXX.~?~cAcA, where cG?cA is the backup number. If cD$kept-versionscA is
    set to 0 this feature is disabled and the default single backup file is
    created.

    The most recent backup will always be cG.~0~cA and the last version will be
    cG.~n~cA where cGncA is cD$kept-versionscA - 1. when the file is next saved the cG.~0~cA
    backup file is moved to cG.~1~cA, cG.~1~cA to cG.~2~cA etc, backup cG.~n~cA is removed.
    Evidently if cD$kept-versionscA it set to a large number this can effect
    performance.


cERESTRICTIONS cA


    cD$kept-versionscA may only be used when DOS file name restrictions are not
    enabled. This means that some systems (such as DOS) cannot use this
    functionality, see ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le for more information. Backup files are only
    created when buffer mode lsbackup(2m)lmbackup(2m)le is enabled.


cENOTES cA


    This feature is not supported when writing ftp files, a single backup file
    is created when backup files are enabled.

cEcENAME cEcA


    $buffer-indent - Current buffer indentation scheme.
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$buffer-indentcA cCindentNumcA; Default is cG0cA  

    0 <= cCindentNumcA <= 255


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$buffer-indentcA sets the current buffers indentation scheme. cCindentNumcA is
    the identity of the indentation scheme, as defined by lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le, which is
    typically the same value as the buffers hilighting scheme number (see
    ls$buffer-hilight(5)lm$buffer-hilight(5)le).

    The default setting is 0 which specifies no indentation scheme is present.
    When non-zero, the value identifies the indentation scheme.

    A buffer assigned an indentation method, MicroEmacs performs automatic
    line re-styling, by moving the left indentation, according to the defined
    indentation method. The cGtabcA key is typically disabled. This behavior can
    be altered using bit cG0x1000cA of the ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le variable, which can be
    changed using lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le.

    The use of tab characters to create the required indentation is determined
    by the setting of the buffers lstab(2m)lmtab(2m)le mode. If the mode is disabled tab
    characters are used wherever possible, otherwise spaces are always used.


cENOTES cA


    The commands lsrestyle-region(3)lmrestyle-region(3)le and lsrestyle-buffer(3)lmrestyle-buffer(3)le use the indentation
    method when defined.

    The buffer indentation scheme is typically assigned in the cCfhookcA macro,
    see lslanguageTemplates(2)lmLanguage Templatesle.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example sets up an indentation scheme for a buffer within
    the cCfhookcA macro.

sB
          !if &sequal .hilight.foo "ERROR"
              set-variable .hilight.foo &pinc .hilight.next 1

          ....

          ; Define the indentation scheme
          0 indent  .hilight.foo 2 10
          indent .hilight.foo n "then" 4
          indent .hilight.foo s "else" -4
          indent .hilight.foo o "endif" -4

          ....

          ; File hook - called when new file is loaded.
          define-macro fhook-foo
              ; if arg is 0 this is a new file so add template
              !if &not @#
                  etfinsrt "foo"
              !endif
              ; Assign the hilighting
              set-variable $buffer-hilight .hilight.foo
              ; Assign the buffer indentation
              set-variable $buffer-indent .hilight.foo
              ; Set the abbreviation file
              buffer-abbrev-file "foo"
              ; Temporary comment to make sure that it works.
              ml-write "Loaded a foo file"
          !emacro

sA
    This provides an indentation of the form:-

        if condition
        then

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$MENAMEcA is an environment variable which may be used to initialize the
    MicroEmacs 2009 environment for a given user. At start-up, if cD$MENAMEcA is
    defined then the user's configuration and history file "cGnamecAcC.erfcA" is
    located and read, where cGnamecA is the variable value. The environment
    variable is used to initialise the ls$user-name(5)lm$user-name(5)le variable.

    Where the user name has been specified on the command line using the cD-ucA
    option to lsme(1)lmme(1)le then the environment variable is ignored and cD-ucA option
    takes precedence.

    The user configuration and session file has many uses, see lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le
    and lsread-session(3)lmread-session(3)le for more information.


cEMicrosoft Windows Environments  cA


    Within Microsoft Windows environments, if cClogincA is enabled then the users
    login name is automatically used as the first choice login name. No
    environment variables need to be set. If login is not enabled then one of
    the aforementioned methods should be used.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$trunc-schemecA sets the color scheme used when drawing a line truncation
    indicator. The left truncation character (usually a cCcG$cAcA char) drawn at the
    start of the line indicates that the line has been scrolled to the right
    and therefore the start of the line has been truncated. A right truncation
    char (also usually a cCcG$cAcA) drawn at the end of the line indicates the
    remainder of the line is too long to fit onto the width of the window so
    the end has been truncated and the indicator drawn.

    The cCschemeNumcA selected must be a color scheme defined with
    lsadd-color-scheme(2)lmadd-color-scheme(2)le, which identifies the foreground and background color
    schemes. A hilight scheme can define its own truncation color scheme, see

    lsforward-line(2)lmforward-line(2)le etc.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example first stores the current window's buffer position
    and the window layout. The middle cCcG...cAcA section could be replaced with

    If these variables are set by the user or a macro the value is validated

    lead to the variable being reset if found to be invalid. For example, if
    the current line is 10 when the cD$window-y-scrollcA is set to 20 the variable
    will be reset to 0 as a value of 20 will mean the current line is not
    displayed in the current window.

    $buffer-backup - Buffer backup file name
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$buffer-backupcA cCFileNamecA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$buffer-backupcA is automatically set to the file name the current buffer's
    file would be backed up to if required. If the current buffer has no file
    name the variable will be set to "".

    The value depends on whether DOS compliant file names are being used (see
    ls$system(5)lm$system(5)le), whether multiple backups are being kept (see
    ls$kept-versions(5)lm$kept-versions(5)le) and the setting of the environment variables
    cD$MEBACKUPPATHcA and cD$MEBACKUPSUBcA. The variable does not take into
    consideration the current setting of the buffer's lsbackup(2m)lmbackup(2m)le mode which
    determine whether a backup will be made.

    The environment variable cD$MEBACKUPPATHcA can be used to change the location
    of the backup files, it can also be used to prepend the backup filename
    with a string. cD$MEBACKUPPATHcA can specify an absolute path (e.g.
    cGcGc:/temp/mebackup/cAcA) or a relative path (e.g. cGcGmebackup/cAcA which will move
    all backup files into a sub-directory automatically in the files
    directory).

    The trailing cCcG/cAcA is important as the file name is simple appended, i.e. is
    creating a backup for "c:/foo/bar.txt" and cD$MEBACKUPPATHcA is set the
    "backup" the backup file name will be "c:/foo/backupbar.txt".

    The environment variable cD$MEBACKUPSUBcA can be used to substitute strings
    within the backup filename for another. The format of the value is a list
    of cDsed(1)cA string substitutions, i.e.

        $MEBACKUPSUB="s/from1/to1/ s/from2/to2/ s/fr..."


    The 3 divide characters do not have to be '/'s, they can be any character
    as long as they are the same, e.g. "sXfrom1Xto1X". When define MicroEmacs
    performs a simple search for string cGcGfrom1cAcA (i.e. no regex support) and
    replaces any match with the string "to1" etc.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example compares the differences between the current version
    and the bucked up version using the lsdiff(3)lmdiff(3)le macro. The cDdiff-changescA macro

    cD$versioncA "cCYYYYMMDDbNcA"  - Beta Release  
    


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$versioncA is a system variable which is defined as the MicroEmacs build
    date code. This value is fixed at compile time and cannot be changed. The
    variable may be used in macros to identify incompatibility issues.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    Given a macro that only operates with a MicroEmacs executable built on or
    after 1st August 2001 then this macro should check that cG$versioncA is not
    less than cG20010801cA. The check may be performed as follows:

sB
          !if &les $version "20010801"
              ml-write "[Error: MicroEmacs executable is incompatible]"
              !abort
          !endif

sA
cENOTES cA


    This variable was introduced in 2001-08-01, evaluating this variable on an
    earlier version of MicroEmacs would return the string cGcGERRORcAcA unless an
    environment variable $version has been defined. cGcGERRORcAcA evaluates to cG0cA
    hence the test still operates correctly.

    In 2024 with version "20091224" the variable was extended to introduce 
    beta-releases with the string  "b1" or "b2" at the end, for instance
    "20091224b1". 
    
    Please note that since 2021 the four numbers at the beginning does not give
    the release year, but the version year. There is this MicroEmacs 2009 version
    and an other, at this time not yet released, MicroEmacs 2024 version.
    
    This variable is used in the macro file cGme.emfcA to check for any macro -
    executable incompatibility issues.

    $window-flags - Current window setup flags
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$window-flagscA cCbitmaskcA; Default is cG0cA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cD$window-flagscA variable is used to set or get various behavioural
    characteristic settings of the current window, it is a bit based flag
    where:

    cD0x001cA
    
       If set the width of the window is locked, calls to
       lsresize-all-windows(2)lmresize-all-windows(2)le will maintained the width of this window
       whenever possible.

    cD0x002cA
    
       If set the depth of the window is locked, calls to
       lsresize-all-windows(2)lmresize-all-windows(2)le will maintained the depth of this window
       whenever possible.

    cD0x004cA
    
       If set the buffer being displayed by the window is locked, the user
       can still manually change the buffer being displayed (by using
       commands like lsfind-buffer(2)lmfind-buffer(2)le) but commands that pop-up buffers (such
       as lshelp(2)lmhelp(2)le or lsfind-tag(2)lmfind-tag(2)le) will not use this window.

    cD0x008cA
    
       When set the command lscompare-windows(2)lmcompare-windows(2)le will ignore this window.

    cD0x010cA
    
       When set the commands like lsprevious-window(2)lmprevious-window(2)le and lsnext-window(2)lmnext-window(2)le will
       skip this window unless the numeric argument given to the command is
       used to override the flag setting.

    cD0x020cA
    
       When set the command lsdelete-other-windows(2)lmdelete-other-windows(2)le will not delete this
       window unless the numeric argument given to the command is used to
       override the flag setting.

    cD0x040cA
    
       When set the command lsdelete-window(2)lmdelete-window(2)le will not delete this window
       unless the numeric argument given to the command is used to override
       the flag setting.

    cD0x080cA
    
       When set the window cannot be split using either the
       lssplit-window-horizontally(2)lmsplit-window-horizontally(2)le or lssplit-window-vertically(2)lmsplit-window-vertically(2)le commands.

    cD0x100cA
    
       If not set the window cannot be deleted if it is the only window
       without this bit set. This more esoteric feature is utilized by the
       toolbar, all toolbar windows have this bit set which means that the
       main user window cannot be delete.


cENOTES cA


    The $window-flags setting is not preserved during a window splitting
    operation (i.e. using a command like lssplit-window-vertically(2)lmsplit-window-vertically(2)le) as the
    persistence of these settings can lead to unexpected behaviour.

    The toolbar uses bit 0x1000 to indicate that the window is displaying a
    toolbar tool, this bit should not be used by users and its value should be
    maintained.

    $line-flags - Current buffer line flags
$a


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$line-flagscA cCbitmaskcA; No default


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cD$line-flagscA variable is used to retrieve or define the behavioral
    settings of the current line in the buffer. This variable is a bit flag,
    the length of the bit flag is variable. In smaller builds of MicroEmacs
    where features have been disabled then the field is only 8 bits wide, in a
    normal build then the full 16 bits are present.

    cD0x0001cA
    
       The line has changed as a result of an edit and has not been
       re-displayed. The flag is cleared when the change has been displayed.
       This bit is read only.

    cD0x0002cA
    
       The line contains an alpha mark defined by lsset-alpha-mark(2)lmset-alpha-mark(2)le. This bit
       is read only.

    cD0x0004cA
    
       The line contains a narrow region, set by lsnarrow-buffer(2)lmnarrow-buffer(2)le. This bit
       is read only.

    cD0x0008cA
    
       The line contains some other type of anchor. This bit is read only.

    cD0x0010cA
    
       The line should be saved without a new-line or nil termination
       character.

    cD0x0020cA
    
       The line is a mark-up line used for annotation and should not be saved
       on a write operation. This bit permits lines in a buffer to be
       inserted for display or annotation purposes which are automatically
       discarded when the buffer is written to file. Mark-up lines are
       sometimes used by the buffer folding and collapsing to annotate folds.

    cD0x0040cA
    
       The line is protected. A protected line may be deleted or edited
       however it is not possible to split or join a protected line with any
       other line. This is used by the folding or collapse mechanisms to
       protect lsnarrow-buffer(2)lmnarrrowle regions from editing operations.

    cD0x0080-0x0800cA
    
       User defined. Users may use the upper most bits from left to right.
       JASSPA may use more bits in future releases which shall be consumed
       from the lower bits, right to left.

    cD0xf000cA
    
       The shifted ls$line-scheme(5)lm$line-scheme(5)le setting. A value of zero indicates that
       there is no line scheme in effect on the line.

    Where a bit flag is defined as read only then an attempt by the user to
    set a read-only bit then the bit setting is ignored, any remaining
    writable bits are set as requested.

    cD$user-namecA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$user-namecA is the name of the MicroEmacs user. The name is used for
    identifying  user configuration  files  such  as  cC$user-namecAcD.emfcA and
    cC$user-namecAcD.erfcA, the start-up lsUserProfiles(2)lmuserle macro file and lserf(8)lmerf(8)le registry file
    that contains saved user preferences.

    The cD$user-namecA is determined as follows, in order of precedence:

    - The lsme(1)lmme(1)le command line option cD-ucA cCusernamecA.
    - The environment variable ls$MENAME(5)lmMENAME(5)le (alternatively via cG$LOGNAMEcA on
          Microsoft Windows platforms ONLY).
    - The name determined from the system. On UNIX then the cG/etc/passwdcA
          entry is used, on MicroSoft Windows then the login name is used.
    - When no other name is located then cGusercA is used (MS-DOS and
          Microsoft Windows environments running without a login mechanism).

    For most conventional cClogincA systems then the correct login name is
    retrieved and it is not necessary to over-ride the name, unless a special
    configuration of MicroEmacs is being used.


cENOTES cA


    The user should not attempt to write to cD$user-namecA, the variable should be

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD$user-pathcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$user-pathcA is the name of the MicroEmacs user directory where user
    configuration files such as ls$user-name(5)lm$user-namelecD.emfcA, ls$user-name(5)lm$user-namelecD.erfcA and personal
    spelling dictionaries are stored. This is an absolute directory path and
    is always terminated with a directory separator character cCcG/cAcA.

    The value of the variable is determined when the editor is started as
    follows:

    - The environment variable ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le is defined, the cD$user-pathcA
          is set to this value. If the environment $MEUSERPATH is defined
          without a trailing '/' then it is automatically added.
    - The environment variable ls$MEPATH(5)lm$MEPATH(5)le is defined and ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le is
          undefined. The first directory in the $MEPATH variable is used as
          the $user-path directory.
    - The directory is determined from the system:
       cDUNIXcA: the home directory from cG/etc/passwdcA entry is used and appended
       with cG.jasspacA i.e. cG$HOME/.jasspacA, if the sub-directory ls$user-name(5)lm$user-namele is
       detected in this directory then it is used instead
       (cG$HOME/.jasspa/$user-namecA).  
       cDMicrosoft WindowscA: the user application data directory is obtained
       from the system and appended with cGjasspacA i.e. cG$APPDATA/jasspacA. If the
       sub-directory ls$user-name(5)lm$user-namele is detected in this directory then it is used
       instead (cG$APPDATA/jasspa/$user-namecA).  
       cDMS-DOScA and older versions of cDMicrosoftcA cDWindowscA without cCInternetcA
       cCExplorercA cC4.0cA then a sub-directory ls$user-name(5)lm$user-namele of the program directory
       ls$progname(5)lm$progname(5)le is used.

    For most conventional cClogincA systems then the correct user path is
    retrieved and it is not necessary to over-ride the pathname, unless a
    special configuration of MicroEmacs is being used. Where the user
    directory is to be manually specified then ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le is the preferred
    method.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    These environment variables control the run-time search paths for
    MicroEmacs and affect the operation of ls$search-path(5)lm$search-path(5)le and ls$user-path(5)lm$user-path(5)le,
    the macro search path and user macro directory respectively.

    cD$MEINSTALLPATHcA is an environment variable that overrides any internally
    defined search path for MicroEmacs system macros and defines the root
    directory(s) of the MicroEmacs system macros. The presence of the
    environment variable affects ls$search-path(5)lm$search-path(5)le.

    The environment variable cD$MEINSTALLPATHcA is ignored if cD$MEPATHcA is defined.
    The search path is always included after any user path defined by
    ls$user-name(5)lm$user-name(5)le.

    cD$MEUSERPATHcA is an environment variable that defines the users private
    directory where user configuration files such as ls$user-name(5)lm$user-namelecD.emfcA,
    ls$user-name(5)lm$user-namele.erf and personal spelling dictionaries are stored. This is an
    absolute directory path. The environment variable sets the MicroEmacs
    variable ls$user-name(5)lm$user-name(5)le.

    cD$MEPATHcA is an environment variable that may be used to define the absolute
    search path for MicroEmacs macro files and affects the setting of
    cD$search-pathcA. The path should include the system macros location(s) and
    should include the user directory location ls$user-path(5)lm$user-path(5)le as the first path
    when the environment variable ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le is not defined. If
    cD$MEUSERPATHcA is defined then this path name appears before the cD$MEPATHcA
    variable to define the user directory location. cD$MEPATHcA is not searching,
    so ALL all directories to be searched must be included in the path
    specification.

    ls$MEUSERPATH(5)lm$MEUSERPATH(5)le is the preferred method used to defined the user directory.


cESearch Paths  cA


    MicroEmacs needs to know the installation directory location(s) of its
    macro files when it executes, this includes both user defined and system
    macros. MicroEmacs performs a searching operation of well-known directory
    locations where it may expect to find these macros at start up, the
    locations that it has found are saved in macro variables ls$user-path(5)lm$user-path(5)le and
    ls$search-path(5)lm$search-path(5)le and are used to subsequently locate files thereafter. The
    environment variables defined here allow that default search process to be
    modified by the user or system administrator.

    Directories are specified as cCsearchingcA if a search operation is performed.
    The following sub-directories of a base directory are searched for the
    existence of subdirectories:

      cC.cA - root directory.  
      ls$user-name(5)lm$user-namele - private user directory.  
      cCcompanycA - company files.   
      cCmacroscA - JASSPA standard macros.  
      cCspellingcA - spelling dictionaries.  

    MicroEmacs performs a searching operation on some directories to locate
    information. Generally, if the directory exists then it is included in the
    search path, otherwise it is excluded. Any subdirectories that are found
    are added in the order presented above. The ls$search-path(5)lm$search-pathle is ONLY evaluated
    at start-up therefore directories created after MicroEmacs is running are
    not detected until the editor is closed down and re-started.


cEUNIX  cA


    The defined search paths for UNIX are defined as follows:-

    Default install directories:-

       cC/opt/jasspacA - searching (SunOS, HP-UX, AIX and IRIX only)  
       cC/usr/share/jasspacA - searching  
       cC/usr/local/share/jasspacA - searching (BSD systems only)  
       cC/usr/local/jasspacA - searching  

    The default user location is defined as follows.

       cC$(passwd-home)/.jasspacA - searching

    MicroEmacs searches for user defined configuration files in this directory
    and will write new user configuration files to this directory. The
    behaviour of the search may be over-ridden by setting some environment
    variables.

    cG$MEUSERPATHcA - not searching
    
       Specified as a single pathname and redefines the cC$user-pathcA where user
       macros are placed, this overrides the cC$(passwd-home)/.jasspacA directory
       location.

    cG$MEINSTALLPATHcA - searching
    
       Specified as multiple pathname components and overrides the default
       install directory location (i.e. cG/usr/local/jasspacA, etc. Typically
       used when the system macro directory has been install in another
       location that is not included in the default search path. This does
       not affect the user directory location.

    cG$MEPATHcA - not searching
    
       Overrides the cC$(passwd-home)/.jasspacA and default search paths
       (including cG$MEINSTALLPATHcA), MicroEmacs will use this directory as the
       search path. The user directory is assumed to be the FIRST directory
       path in the string unless the cG$MEUSERPATHcA environment variable is
       defined which specifies the user path.


cEMicrosoft Windows  cA


    The defined search paths for WINDOWS are defined as follows:-

        Default search locations:-

       cCExecutable directory locationcA - searching

    The default user location is defined as follows. MicroEmacs searches for
    user defined configuration files in this directory and will write new user
    configuration files to this directory.

        cC$APPDATA\jasspacA - not searching

    If the system does not define a user application data location (cDWin95cA and
    cDWin32scA) then a directory ls$user-name(5)lm$user-namele or the executable location is used.

    The behaviour may be over-ridden by setting the environment variables as
    follows:

    cG$MEUSERPATHcA - not searching
    
       Specified as a single pathname and redefines the users home directory,
       this overrides the cC$APPDATA\jasspacA directory location.

    cG$MEINSTALLPATHcA - searching
    
       Specified as multiple pathname components and overrides the default
       install directory location. Typically used when the macro directory
       has been install in another location that is not in the same directory
       as the executable. This does not affect the user directory location.

    cG$MEPATHcA - not searching
    
       Overrides the cC$APPDATA\jasspacA and default search paths. MicroEmacs
       will use the FIRST directory path as the ls$user-path(5)lm$user-pathle unless cG$MEUSERPATHcA
       is defined.


cEMS-DOS  cA


    MS-DOS does not include a concept of a user name or user directory.

       Default search locations:-

       cCExecutable directory locationcA - searching

    If a sub-directory exists at the executable location with name ls$user-name(5)lm$user-namele
    then this is used as ls$user-path(5)lm$user-pathle, otherwise the execution directory
    location is used.

    The behaviour may be over-ridden using the environment variables.

    cG$MEUSERPATHcA - not searching
    
       Specified as a single pathname and redefines the ls$user-path(5)lm$user-pathle overriding
       the cCexecutablecA directory location.

    cG$MEINSTALLPATHcA - searching
    
       Specified as multiple pathname components and overrides the default
       executable directory location. Typically used when the macro directory
       has been installed at a different location that is not in the same
       directory as the executable. This does not affect the user directory
       location.

    cG$MEPATHcA - not searching
    
       Overrides the cCExecutable...cA and default search paths (including
       cG$MEINSTALLPATHcA). MicroEmacs will use FIRST directory path as the
      ls$user-path(5)lm$user-pathle unless $MEUSERPATH is defined.

    cD$buffer-indent-widthcA  


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$indent-widthcA defines the default indentation width assumed by the editor,
    this defines the number of characters the lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le command should use for
    indenting text. Once the value is set then all new buffers that are
    subsequently created assume an indent value of cD$indent-widthcA. The default
    value when omitted is 4 characters.

    cD$buffer-indent-widthcA specifies the indent to use in a buffer, the value of
    cD$indent-widthcA is used as a default when the buffer is created.
    Modification of the cD$buffer-indent-widthcA value causes the buffer
    indentation width to be modified. The value is typically set by the
    cDfhook-xxxcA macro when initializing a buffer using the lslanguageTemplates(2)lmLanguage Templatesle.

    cD$quietcA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD$quietcA is variable that controls the audible and visual warnings. When the
    variable is set to 0 then quiet mode is disabled, when set to 1 then quiet
    mode is enabled.

    When quiet mode is enabled, visual warnings are given instead of the
    default audible warning. This mode can only be globally changed, an error
    will occur if an attempt is made to change the mode for a buffer.

    The default state is on, so users of MicroEmacs can relax in the knowledge
    that they will not annoy other people when things go wrong.

    When disabled the system bell is rung when required, otherwise the usual
    visual warning is the "[BELL]" string, printed on the bottom right hand
    side.

cESYNOPSIS cA


    cC<pattern> <insertionString>cA  
    cC<pattern> <insertionString>cA  
    cC<pattern> <insertionString>cA  
    cC<pattern> <insertionString>cA  


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The MicroEmacs 2009 abbreviation file, typically given the extension cD.eafcA,
    defines a set of shorthand expansion strings which are used by the command
    lsexpand-abbrev(2)lmexpand-abbrev(2)le. lsbuffer-abbrev-file(2)lmbuffer-abbrev-file(2)le defines the abbreviation file.

    The abbreviation file line based, with one abbreviation per line, with no
    intervening blank lines. Each line comprises of two columns, the first
    column cC<pattern>cA identifies the source pattern to be expanded, the second
    column cC<insertionString>cA defines the replacement text. The two text
    columns are separated by a space character.

    When lsexpand-abbrev(2)lmexpand-abbrev(2)le is invoked and the expansion cC<pattern>cA is
    recognized, then cC<pattern>cA is deleted from the buffer and replaced with
    cC<insertionString>cA.

    The fields are defined as follows:-

    cC<pattern>cA
    
       The source pattern to be expanded. The data commences in text column 0
       and spans to the first white space character (cGSPACEcA or cGtabcA). The
       pattern may not include any white space characters.

    cC<insertionString>cA
    
       The replacement string exists from the first non-white space character
       following the cC<pattern>cA to the end of the line. The replacement string
       may include special tokens, delimited by a backslash (cCcG\cAcA) character
       which are interpreted as follows:-

        cD\BcA Move cursor backwards
    
         A positioning control. Allows the cursor to be moved backwards 1
          character.

        cD\dcA Delete cGtabcA backwards
    
         Back tab. Deletes a tab character backwards.

        cD\m"cA<string>" Macro execution
    
         Takes the remainder of the line as a keyboard macro definition.
          The macro string is generated using lsinsert-macro(2)lminsert-macro(2)le and must be
          contained in double quotes. When invoked the keyboard macro is
          executed and the appropriate text is inserted into a buffer. This
          is typically only used for more complex operations.

        cD\pcA Position
    
         The resultant position of the cursor following the expansion. If
          the cursor position is not specified, the cursor is placed at the
          end of the expansion string by default.

        cD\rcA Carriage Return (Newline)
    
         A newline in the replacement text. Note while lsindent(2m)lmindent(2m)le is
          enabled a sequence a single "\r" retains the indent on the next
          line, however a sequence of two "\r\r" characters does not retain
          the tab position and returns the cursor to the start of the second
          line. If blank lines are required retaining tab positioning then a
          keyboard macro string should be used instead. (see "\m" above).

        cD\tcA Tab
    
         A tab character in the replacement text.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following example provides abbreviations for the 'C' programming
    language, found in file cDc.eafcA. All cursor positions in the examples are
    shown by cD<@>cA.

        #i "#include <\p>\r"
        #d "#define \p"
        if "if(\p)\r{\r\r}\r"
        ef "else if(\p)\r{\r\r}\r"
        el "else\r{\r\p\r}\r"
        wh "while(\p)\r{\r\r}\r"
        sw "switch(\p)\r{\rcase :\rdefault :\r}\r"


    Given that the abbreviation file has been declared then expansion of:

        #d<@>       =>      #define <@>
 
        if<@>       =>      if(<@>)
                               {
 
                               }
 
        sw<@>       =>      switch(<@>)
                               {
                               case :
                               default :
                               }


    Note, in all of the examples, the abbreviation replacement strings specify
    a resultant cursor position, typically where the next edit will take
    place.

    The macros may alternatively be defined using keyboard macros. The
    aforementioned macros could have been re-written with the following
    definitions which are equivalent:-

        #i \m"#include <\CX\CAP>\CM\CXaP\CX)"
        #d \m"#define \CX)"
        if \m"if(\CX\CAP)\CM{\CM}\CXaP\CX)"
        ef \m"else if(\CX\CAP)\CM{\CM\CM}\CM\CXaP\CX)"
        el \m"else\CM{\CM\CX\CAP\CM}\CM\CXaP\CX)"
        wh \m"while(\CX\CAP)\CM{\CM\CM}\CM\CXaP\CX)"
        sw \m"switch(\CX\CAP)\CM{\CMcase :\CMdefault:\CM}\CM\CXaP\CX)"


    Within a macro, the cursor positioning is generally achieved by setting a
    mark where the resultant cursor is to be positioned (see lsset-mark(2)lmset-mark(2)le),
    when the macro is finished then an lsexchange-point-and-mark(2)lmexchange-point-and-mark(2)le is initiated
    to move the cursor to the correct position; alternatively a sequence of
    cursor movements may be used.

    The "\B" and "\d" are typically used for positioning the cursor on
    subsequent lines. "\d" is the inverse of "\t". Consider the following
    Pascal definition for an cCelsecA, cCbegincA and cCendcA sequence:-

         el "else\rbegin\r\t\p;\r\dend;"


    with lsindent(2m)lmindent(2m)le mode enabled generates:-

                   else
                   begin
                       <@>;
                   end;


    Similarly the "\B" is typically used when lsindent(2m)lmindent(2m)le is enabled, but when
    the tab spacing is known. Consider the following example used in the
    MicroEmacs 2009 cD.emfcA files to define a help entry. In this case the indent
    is known to be 5 characters. Hence to move the cursor back 5 characters
    then a sequence of cD\BcA's are used:- 

        !h "def .. \rSEE ALSO\r     <cross references>\r\B\B\B\B!ehelp"


    the expansion in this case is:-

        define-help "<@>"
 
        ...
 
        SEE ALSO
                <cross references>
        !ehelp

    etf - MicroEmacs template file format


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cC<Free Form Text>cA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The MicroEmacs 2009 template file, typically given the extension cD.etfcA, is
    a file template for a new file and defines common text that is
    automatically included when a new file is created.

    The file inclusion is usually performed by macro lsetfinsrt(3)lmetfinsrt(3)le, called from
    the lsfileHooks(2)lmFile Hooksle. The template file has no specific format, although
    cDetfinsrtcA replaces key strings with relevant information.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The template file is inserted with the file hooks. If a file hook is
    called with an argument of cG0cA then the buffer has been created and the
    template file is inserted.

sB
          define-macro fhook-c
              ; if arg is 0 this is a new file so add template
              !if &not @#
                  ; Is it an include h file or a c file?
                  !if &seq &mid $buffer-bname &rsin "." $buffer-bname 1 "h"
                      etfinsrt "h"
                  !else
                      etfinsrt "c"
                  !endif
              !endif
              1 buffer-mode "time"
              .
              .
          !emacro

sA    See lsetfinsrt(3)lmetfinsrt(3)le for more information on how the template file is located
    and inserted into the buffer.

    The default MicroEmacs 2009 'C' mode template is defined as follows, but
    may be replaced with any other text:-

    binary files read by MicroEmacs 2009 and cannot be edited directly.

    MicroEmacs 2009 is supplied with a dictionaries for various languages. It
    is recommended that these dictionaries are not modified, a personal
    dictionary is used and modified instead.

    A personal dictionary, cCusercAcD.edfcA, is automatically created in the users
    directory for additional spelling information.

cESYNOPSIS cA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The MicroEmacs 2009 macro files are ASCII text files, given the file
    extension cD.emfcA. A number of special macro files exist as follows:-

    cDme.emfcA
    
       The start-up macro file. This file is the first macro file to be
       invoked and is used to bootstrap MicroEmacs 2009 into the correct
       configuration.

    cDhkcA_<name>cD_.emfcA
    
       Macro files prefixed with cDhkcA generally denote lsfileHooks(2)lmFile Hookle macro files
       which are automatically invoked when known file types are loaded.

    cC<logname>cDcA.emfcA
    
       The users start-up configuration file, typically used to configure the
       environment with the users preferences.

       Platform specific configuration files, used to configure the
       environment for a specific platform.

    Macro files may be any name, the more prominent macro files are:-

    cDcolor.emfcA
    
       Color definitions for the buffers.

    cDmouse.emfcA
    
       Mouse interaction macros.

    cDosd.emfcA
    
       OSD Menu configuration file.

    erf - MicroEmacs registry file


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cC; Comment to the end of the linecA  
    cC<command>cA ::= cD"cA_<identifier>cB"cD [ cA=cD cA"cA<string>cD_"cD ][ cA{cA cC<command>cA cD}cA ] *  


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    MicroEmacs 2009 registry files are ASCII text files, given the file
    extension cD.erfcA. The registry file is a simple syntax that allows an
    cCidentifiercA to be associated with a cCstringcA. The cCidentifierscA are unique and
    allow a cCstringcA value to be found when a search for a cCidentifiercA is made.
    The cCstringcA component is optional.

    The syntax allows the cCidentifiercA's to be hierarchically nested, children
    of the cCidentifiercA node are enclosed in a set of curly braces cD{cA ... cD}cA. The
    enclosure itself comprises a number of cCidentifierscA, which may have their
    own enclosures, and so on.

    The backslash character `cG\cA' is the escape character, the following
    sequences of escape character are recognized:-

        `\\` - Literal backslash
        `\"` - Double quote (used within a quoted string)
        `\n` - New line character.
        `\t` - Tab character.

    The semi-colon character `cG;cA' introduces a comment which exists to the end
    of the line.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following is an example of a registry file:-

        ; -!- erf -!-
        ; Comment on this line
        "dos"
        {
               "file-ignore" = "~ ./ .o"
               "font" = "85"
               "mail-dir" = "c:/mail/"
               "mail-send" = "echo from \"%f\" file \"%o\""
               "mail-src" = "c:/mail/jon"
               "nested"="value"
               {
                   "foo"="bar"
               }
        }


    The history file cCusername.erfcA is a good example of the use of the
    registry. This file retains historical session information in The history
    registry file is automatically written at the end of a editing session
    when the editor is closed down (or may be saved explicitly using
    lssave-session(3)lmsave-session(3)le).

    Every user should have their own personal history file in their personal
    MicroEmacs directory. The history file is located from the MicroEmacs 2009
    search path defined by ls$user-path(5)lm$user-path(5)le, and is named by the variable
    ls$user-name(5)lm$user-name(5)le.


cENOTES cA


    - The registry files are not currently written with a backup.
    - Special care should be taken when editing registry files when they
      are loaded into MicroEmacs. It is recommended that the registry file
      is not loaded as a registry item when editing the registry text
      file.

    To edit the history registry file within MicroEmacs then the following
    sequence of steps should be followed:-

    - Save the current session lssave-session(3)lmsave-session(3)le.
    - Load the history registry file cCusernamecA.erf.
    - Edit the file.
    - Save edits back to the file.
    - Re-install the history lsread-session(3)lmread-session(3)le. This flushes the current
      session and restores it from the file. The new edits should now be
      in the registry.
    - Examine the loaded registry using lslist-registry(2)lmlist-registry(2)le.

    ehf - MicroEmacs help file


cESYNOPSIS cA


    cD!cAcC<helpTag>cA  
    cC<Text Description>cA  
    ...  
    cD|cAcC<helpId>cA

    cD!cAcC<helpTag>cA  
    cC<Text Description>cA  
    ...  


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The on-line help information is retained in the file cDme.ehfcA, this is an
    ASCII text file which holds all of the on-line help information. The help
    file comprises of formatted text cC<Text Description>cA which is literally
    displayed to the user when help information is requested. Each text
    description is delimited into pages with a cD!cAcC<helpTag>cA which identifies the
    block of text with a help label.

    The cD!cAcC<helpTag>cA is placed before the text description and is identified by
    a exclamation mark (`cD!cA') placed at the beginning of the line. The
    cC<helpTag>cA is the identifying name used by the help system and takes the
    following form:

        `LSSNNNN...`

    Where:

    cDLcA
    
       Is the length of the cGcGNNNN...cAcA name which must be matched, a value of
       cC` `cA indicates that the whole name must be matched, otherwise the value
       must be in the range cCcG1cAcA - cCcG9cAcA indicating the number of characters to
       be match.

    cDSScA
    
       Is the section number of the page, the first character should be a
       numeric (i.e. cCcG3cAcA for a macro) and the second is an optional section
       letter. A value of cC` `cA indicates no section number and/or letter.

    cDNNNN...cA
    
       The page name, the length is unlimited but must be on one line.

    Multiple cC<helpTag>cA's may be associated with a common text description by
    proceeding a block of text with multiple tags, each on a separate line,
    with no intervening non-tag lines (i.e. lines that do not commence with
    cD!cA).

    The cC<Text Description>cA that follows is the text associated with the tag.
    When the help system is invoked with the tag then the text is displayed.
    There are 2 types of internal command lines, lines starting with a cCcG|cAcA
    indicate that the following line should only be displayed if the requested
    help page is cC<helpId>cA, where cC<helpId>cA is the the name used in the
    cC<helpTag>cA. This is a useful mechanism for pages with multiple cC<helpTag>cAs.

    Lines which contain just cGcG$?cAcA are MicroEmacs command lines where cG?cA can be:

    cGacA
    
       For a command help page display any global key bindings, for variables
       display its current value.

    MicroEmacs uses a special hilighting scheme to control color schemes and
    hyper-text links, the special embedded tags all start with and escape
    character (0x1b or cCcG^[cAcA) and are defined as follows:

    cG^[c?cA
    
       Tag used to change color where cG?cA can be:
     
              A  white, used for main text.
              B  red, used for underlining.
              C  green, used for italic font.
              D  cyan, used for bold font.
              E  light yellow, used for a header.
              F  light red, used for and image link.

    cG^[s?cA
    
       Tag used to change hilighting scheme where cG?cA can be:
    
              A  Normal ehf hilight.
              B  MicroEmacs macro (or emf) hilighting.
    
       Note that other tags can only be used in the normal ehf hilighting
       scheme.

    cG^[ls<link>^[lm<name>^[lecA
    
       Used to create hyper-links, cG<link>cA is the help link name which can be
       omitted if it is the same as cG<name>cA. cG<name>cA should not contain any
       other tags, it is automatically displayed in the magenta color scheme.


cENOTES cA


    When the help system is invoked for the first time, cDme.ehfcA is loaded into
    internal memory and fragmented into labeled pages using the cC<helpTag>cA
    information. Hence, any edits made to cDme.emfcA are not visible in the help
    system until the next session.

    Macros and alike may add additional help information to the internal help
    database at run-time using the lsdefine-help(2)lmdefine-help(2)le command.

    The help hilighting is applied to the help buffer from the hilighting
    macro's defined in cDhkhelp.emfcA. The hilighting is NOT part of the help
    file.

    Special hilighting keys may be included in cDme.ehfcA provided that they are
    interpreted by the help hilighting defined in cDhkehf.emfcA.

    cC<Text Description>cA lines cannot commence with cD!cA, cD|cA or cD$cA in the first
    column.

        ^[cE^[cEDESCRIPTION ^[cE^[cA


              ^[cDglobal-mode^[cA changes the state of one of the hereditary
              global modes. A buffer's modes are initialized to the global
              modes when first created. This command is very useful in changing
              some of the default behavior such as case sensitive searching (see
              the example below). See ^[ls^[lmOperating Modes^[le for a full list
              and description of modes. Also see ^[ls^[lmbuffer-mode(2)^[le for a
              full description of the use of the argument ^[cCn^[cA.

              The ^[ls^[lminfo(2)^[le command gives a list of the current global
              and buffer modes.

              ^[cDadd-global-mode^[cA and ^[cDdelete-global-mode^[cA are macros
              defined in me3_8.emf which use global-mode to add or remove a global
              mode. They are defined for backward compatibility and for ease of
              use; they are simple macros, add-global-mode is defined as follows:
        ^[sB
                  define-macro add-global-mode
                      ; Has the require mode been given as an argument, if so add it
                      !force 1 global-mode @1
                      !if &not $status
                          ; No - use 1 global-mode to add a mode
                          !nma 1 global-mode
                      !endif
                  !emacro

        ^[sA

        ^[cE^[cEEXAMPLE ^[cE^[cA


              The following example globally disables ^[ls^[lmexact(2m)^[le and
              ^[ls^[lmmagic(2m)^[le modes, if these lines are copied to the user
              setup file then are searches will be simple and case insensitive by
              default:
        ^[sB
                  -1 global-mode "exact"
                  -1 global-mode "magic"

        ^[sA

        ^[cE^[cENOTES ^[cE^[cA


              Globally adding ^[ls^[lmbinary(2m)^[le and ^[ls^[lmcrypt(2m)^[le
              modes is strongly discouraged as any file loaded would be assigned
              these modes. Instead the use of commands ^[ls^[lmfind-bfile(3)^[le
              and ^[ls^[lmfind-cfile(3)^[le are recommended.

              ^[ls^[lmauto(2m)^[le, ^[ls^[lmautosv(2m)^[le, ^[ls^[lmbackup(2m)^[le,

              ^[ls^[lmtab(2m)^[le and ^[ls^[lmundo(2m)^[le modes are present on all
              platforms by default. On Windows and DOS platforms ^[ls^[lmcr(2m)^[le
              is also present and on DOS ^[ls^[lmctrlz(2m)^[le is also present.

cEPLATFORM cA


    cDMicrosoft Windows environments onlycA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDme32.inicA is the Microsoft Windows configuration file, located in the
    windows directory (typically cDC:\WindowscA or cDC:\WINNTcA), the cDme32.inicA file is
    primarily used to counteract the deficiencies of Windows shell environment
    (as compared with UNIX) with respect to the initialization of environment
    variables. The cDme32.inicA file is comparable to the UNIX cC.XdefaultscA and
    cC.profilecA files.

    The configuration file is split into two sections, a cDDefaultscA section,
    which defines system settings and a cDUsercA section which define settings on
    a per user basis. Both sections allow environment variables to be defined
    for export. The cCdefaultscA section is executed first and then the cCusercA
    section which matches the users name. The format of both sections is
    identical.


cESection Keywords  cA


    The keywords identified in each section are defined as follows:-

    cDmepathcA
    
       Equivalent to the setting of the variable ls$MEPATH(5)lm$MEPATH(5)le to define the
       directory (or folder) location of the MicroEmacs 2009 default
       configuration files. If the assignment string is empty then any
       previous value is removed.

    cDmeinstallpathcA
    
       Equivalent of setting the environment variable ls$MEINSTALLPATH(5)lm$MEINSTALLPATH(5)le to
       define the directory (or folder) location of the macros directory. If
       the assignment string is empty then any previous value is removed.

    cDmenamecA
    
       The MicroEmacs ls$user-name(5)lm$user-name(5)le to use rather than the login name. If the
       assignment string is empty then any previous value is removed.

    cDmeuserpathcA
    
       The value of ls$user-path(5)lm$user-path(5)le. If the assignment string is empty then any
       previous value is removed.

    cDgeometrycA=_<width>cD_xcA_<depth>cC+cA<xoffset>cC+cA<yoffset>_
    
       The geometry of the window the width and height are specified in
       character, the position of the window is specified as an offset. If
       the assignment string is empty then any previous preset value is
       removed.

    All other variables (except those commencing with cGmsdevcA which are reserved
    for lsmemsdev(1)lmmemsdev(1)le) are pushed into the environment as environment variables
    which are made during the editing session.


cELocation Section  cA


    The location section, labeled cD[Location]cA, identifies the location of
    MicroEmacs 2009, and is typically used by other components to find and
    launch MicroEmacs. The section includes the following keys:-

    cDexecA
    
       The absolute pathname to the MicroEmacs 2009 executable image.
       External programs such as lsmemsdev(1)lmmemsdev(1)le may use this entry to find the
       executable. This section may be omitted.


cEDefaults Section  cA


    The default section, labeled cD[MeYYMMDD]cA or cD[Defaults]cA define the global
    variable settings for all users. The dated form is searched for first, the
    date corresponds to the specific version of MicroEmacs as displayed by
    lsabout(2)lmabout(2)le. When omitted then the [Defaults] section is used. Either, or
    both sections may be omitted.


cEUser Section  cA


    The cDUser SectioncA is executed after the cDDefaults SectioncA. The cDUser SectioncA
    uses the ls$user-name(5)lm$user-name(5)le which is defined as follows:-

    - The environment variable ls$MENAME(5)lm$MENAME(5)le
    - The cClogin namecA under Windows '95 or NT. If the cClogin namecA is defined
          then the variable ls$user-name(5)lm$user-name(5)le is set to this value.
    - The environment variable ls$LOGNAME(5)lm$LOGNAME(5)le if the cClogin namecA cannot be
          located.

    A single user section is executed that corresponds to the user. If the
    system does not use a login system then a cDmenamecA entry may be placed in
    the defaults section to force a name.

    A cDmenamecA entry appearing in the cCusercA section is used to change the login
    name to a more sensible name when the user login and MicroEmacs user files
    use different names.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following is an example of the cDme32.inicA file, there is no login and a
    user cCJohn DoecA defines his MicroEmacs user name:

         ; External locater for the executable
         [Location]
         exe=c:\Program Files\JASSPA\MicroEmacs\me32.exe
         ;
         ; Default global section
         [Defaults]
         ; mepath
         ; The location of the MicroEmacs common files.
         meinstallpath=d:\jasspa
         mename=john
         ;
         ; User John Doe
         [john]
         ; meuserpath - The location of the users MicroEmacs directory.
         meuserpath=d:\jasspa\john
         ; Define some environment variables.
         INFOPATH=c:\info


    Note that multiple users share the same cDme32.inicA file, each user may
    include their own configuration settings which may be interrogated in the
    configuration files. In the following example a user cCJohn DoecA with login
    name of cCjohndoecA uses private configuration files called cCjohncA:

         ; External locater for the executable
         [Location]
         exe=c:\Program Files\JASSPA\MicroEmacs\me32.exe
         ;
         ; Defaults for RC4 Release
         [Me040201]
         meinstallpath=d:\jasspa_rc4
         ;
         ; Default global section
         [Defaults]
         ; mepath
         ; The location of the MicroEmacs common files.
         meinstallpath=d:\jasspa
         ; Define some environment variables.
         INFOPATH=c:\info
         ;
         ; User John Doe
         [johndoe]
         ; meuserpath - The location of the users MicroEmacs directory.
         meuserpath=d:\jasspa\john
         ; mename - Use "john" instead of "johndoe"
         mename=john
         ; Define startup screen size.
         geometry=110x50+70+30

cEPLATFORM cA


    cDUNIX environments onlycA


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cD.XdefaultscA is the UNIX X-Windows configuration file that permits some of
    the X-Windows start up settings to be configured. The file is typically
    loaded into the X database when the Window Manager starts and the values
    are read from the database by MicroEmacs at start up, over-riding any
    internal defaults.

    The cD.XdefaultscA file is used by other applications and MicroEmacs may be
    added to the end of any existing file.

    The values interpreted by MicroEmacs are defined as follows:

    cDMicroEmacs.font:cA cCfontcA
    
       Specifies the font to use.

    cDMicroEmacs.geometry:cA cCchar-widthcAcDxcCcAchar-heightcA [cD+-cA]cCxoffsetcA [cD+-cA]cCyoffsetcA
    
       The geometry of the X-Window at start-up. cCchar-widthcA and cCchar-heightcA
       define the width and depth of the frame specified in characters of the
       current font. cCxoffsetcA and cCyoffsetcA specify the position of the wind
       with respect to the top left of the screen, defaults are used when
       specified as 0.

    cDMicroEmacs.name:cA cCnamecA
    
       Over-rides the name prefix used in the X-Window title bar, by default
       this is specified as cCMicroEmacscA.

    cDMicroEmacs.iconname:cA cCnamecA
    
       Over-rides the name prefix used in a X-Window iconic display, by
       default this is specified as cCMicroEmacscA.


cEEXAMPLE cA


    The following is an example of the cD.XdefaultscA file:-

cENOTES cA


    The cD.XdefaultscA file is typically read once at login and and any changes to
    the files are not enacted until the Window Manager is re-started or a new
    login session commences.

    The settings in the cD.XdefaultscA may be subsequently overridden by the
    settings defined in lsuser-setup(3)lmuser-setup(3)le.

       Recognized by GNU and MicroEmacs. Denotes a C++ programming type file,
       may be used in cD.ccA, cD.defcA and cD.hcA files.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDCcA and cDC++cA file type templates offer the most sophisticated editing
    features within the MicroEmacs 2009 environment.

    cDGeneral EditingcA
    
       On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
       the file. lstime(2m)lmtime(2m)le is by default enabled, allowing the modification
       time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

    cDHilightingcA
    
       The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
       preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
       language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

    cDAuto LayoutcA
    
       The C-Mode indentation mode of lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le performs automatic layout of
       the text.

       lsrestyle-region(3)lmrestyle-region(3)le and lsrestyle-buffer(3)lmrestyle-buffer(3)le are available to reformat
       (re-layout) selected sections of the buffer, or the whole buffer,
       respectively.

       Comments may be formatted using `esc o`, which reformats the comments
       according to the current fill paragraph. If a comment commences with
       cG/***...cA then the comment is automatically formatted to a box. If the
       comment commentces with cG/**cA then the comment is assumed to be a cCJavacA
       cCDoccA comment.

    cDTagscA
    
       A C-tags file may be generated within the editor using the cDToolscA -> C
       Tools -> cDCreate Tag FilecA. lsfind-tag(2)lmfind-tag(2)le takes the user to the file using
       the tag information.

       On invoking the tag generator then the user is presented with a dialog
       box which specifies the generation option of the tags file. The base
       directory of the tags file search and tagging options may be specified
       to locate all of the definitions within the code space.

       The cDtagscA file is extremely useful where the user is dealing with
       inherited source code spread over multiple directories. Generation of
       a recursive tag file with all searching options enabled allows labels
       to be located extremely rapidly (certainly faster than IDE
       environments).

    cDFolding and Information HidingcA
    
       Generic folding is enabled within the C and C++ files. The folds occur
       about braces cD{cA...cD}cA located on the left-hand margin. lscollapse-all(3)lmcollapse-all(3)le
       (un)folds all regions in the file, lscollapse-current(3)lmcollapse-current(3)le (un)folds the
       current region. Note that folding does not operate on K&R style code.

       The cDToolscA -> cDC ToolscA menu allows cG#definecA's to be evaluated within the
       buffer. Where the state of a cG#ifcA is established to be false (using the
       cG#definecA information) then the disabled region of code is grayed out
       indicating which regions of the code are active.

    cDNavigation via Item ListcA

       Item listing is available and the key constructs of the file may be listed
       using  the lsitem-list(3)lmitem-list(3)le command.

    cDAbreviationscA

       The installation comes with a default abbreviation file for C and C++ file editing
       which can be used by writing short abbreviations like "cCforcA", "cCifcA" or "cCwhcA" (while) - 
       for C and C++ code functions. The list of abbreviations can be used as well interactively in the GUI
       version of MicroEmacs using the  lsabbrev-list(3)lmabbrev-list(3)le command.

    cDWorking EnvironmentcA
 
       lscompile(3)lmcompile(3)le may be invoked to rebuild the source, the user is prompted
       to save any files.

       lsrcs-file(2)lmrcs-file(2)le is automatically invoked if an RCS file is detected, the
       normal check-in/out operations may be performed through the editor.

    cDShort CutscA
    
       The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

       cDC-c C-ccA - Comment out the current line.  
       cDC-c C-dcA - Uncomment the current line.  
       cDC-c C-ecA - Comment to the end of the line with stars (*).  
       cDA-C-icA - Restyle the current region.  
       cDesc qcA - Format a comment.  
       cDesc ocA - Format a comment.  
       cDf2cA - (un)fold the current region  
       cDf3cA - (un)fold all regions  
       cDf6cA - List items.  
       cDesc f6cA - Close list items window.  

    cDAdditional CommandscA
    
       A number of additional commands are available as follows:-

       lsc-slashify(3)lmc-slashify(3)le - Append backslash to end of lines of region.  
       lsc-deslashify(3)lmc-deslashify(3)le - Remove backslash to end of lines of region.  
       lsc-to-cpp-convert(3)lmc-to-cpp-convert(3)le - Convert a C file to C++ file.
       lsc-hash-eval(3)lmc-hash-eval(3)le - Evaluate C/C++ #defines.  
       lsc-hash-del(3)lmc-hash-del(3)le - Remove C/C++ #define evaluation.  
       lsc-hash-set-define(3)lmc-hash-set-define(3)le - Set a C/C++ #define.  
       lsc-hash-unset-define(3)lmc-hash-unset-define(3)le - Unset a C/C++ #define.  

    cDExecuting, Formatting and LintingcA
    
      cD%fhook-c-execcA - The command to execute the current C file, default on Unix systems
        is set to _"LANG=encCUS gcc -Wall -std=c99 %f -o %b 2>&1 &&  ./%b"cA where cC%fcA represents the file name and cC%bcA the
        basename of the current file on Windows the slash is replaced with a backslash
              
      cD%fhook-c-formatcA - The command to format current C file, default is set to 
        cC"astyle %f"cA or cC"clang-format %f -- -std=c99"cA in dependence what is installed 
        on the current system, again cC%fcA represents the file name of the currently edited file.

      cD%fhook-c-lintcA - The command to check/lint the current C file, default is set to
        _"LANG=encCUS gcc -Wall -x c -fsyntax-only %f"cA or cC"clang-tidy %f -- -std=c99"cA if the latter
        is installed on the system. Again cC%fcA represents the currently edited file name.

      cD%fhook-cpp-execcA - The command to execute the current C++ file, default on Unix systems
        is set to _"LANG=encCUS g++ -Wall -std=c++17 %f -o %b 2>&1 && ./%b"cA where cC%fcA represents the file name and cC%bcA the
        basename of the current file on Windows the slash is replaced with a backslash
              
      cD%fhook-cpp-formatcA - The command to format current C++ file, default is set to 
        cC"astyle %f"cA or cC"clang-format %f --std=c++17"cA in dependence what is installed 
        on the current system, again cC%fcA represents the file name of the currently edited file.

      cD%fhook-c++-lintcA - The command to check/lint the current C++ file, default is set to
        cC"g++ -Wall -x c++ -fsyntax-only %f"cA or cC"clang-tidy %f -- -std=c++17"cA if the latter
        is installed on the system. Again cC%fcA represents the currently edited file name.
    
      The setting assume that the mentioned compilers or tools are available via the cCPATHcA
      environment variable. On Windows you must insert here either the complete cCPATHcA to the 
      executables or add the folder where these files are to the cCPATHcA variable. 
      
      These global variables should be changed if necessary usually within your cCUSERNAME.emfcA 
      or cCmyc.emfcA and cCmycpp.emfcA files. 

cENOTES cA


    If the default language is C++, rather than 'C' the order of the file
    hooks should be over-ridden in the users local setup, using:-

sB
          add-file-hook ".c "                                  fhook-c
          add-file-hook ".cc .cpp .hpp .rc .h .def .l .y .i"   fhook-cpp

sA
    This defaults all cD.hcA and cD.defcA files etc. to be C++ rather than C.

    The hilighting is typically extended using a file cDmyc.emfcA (or cDmycpp.emfcA)
    i.e. to include the usual extended types of cDint32cA etc, cDmyc.emfcA might be
    defined as:-

sB
          hilight .hilight.c 1 "uint8"    .scheme.type
          hilight .hilight.c 1 "int8"     .scheme.type
          hilight .hilight.c 1 "uint16"   .scheme.type
          hilight .hilight.c 1 "int16"    .scheme.type
          hilight .hilight.c 1 "uint32"   .scheme.type
          hilight .hilight.c 1 "int32"    .scheme.type
          hilight .hilight.c 1 "float32"  .scheme.type
          hilight .hilight.c 1 "float64"  .scheme.type

sA
cEBUGS cA


    The 'C' and 'C++' templates have been throughly used, there are no known
    issues with the templates.

cEEXTENSIONS cA


    cD.txtcA - ASCII plain text file  
    cD.doccA - ASCII plain text document file


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDdoccA file type template handles the hilighting and text formating of a
    plain text file. Within the text document justification and word wrapping
    are typically enabled. The template allows the user to format text as
    left, right, center or no justification.

    cDAuto LayoutcA
    
       The automatic layout of the text is restricted to justification and
       wrapping and the detection of bulleted lists. ls$fill-bullet(5)lmfill-bullet(5)le may be
       used to determine the character set used for bullet points, on
       encountering a bullet the left-hand justification might be modified.

    cDFormatting rulescA
    
       The default mode of operation is automatic mode which attempts to
       retain the document style whenever a paragraph is re-formatted. This
       allows rapid entry of text into a reasonable format with no special
       formating character embedded in the text.

       The automatic formatting rules used by lsfill-paragraph(2)lmfill-paragraph(2)le in an
       automatic text mode are defined as follows:-

       Text on column 0
     
         Text appearing in the first column is always assumed to be left
          justified, and non-wrapping, provided that the text does not
          extend to the ls$fill-col(5)lmbuffer fill columnle. This is typically used for
          headers and addresses.

       Text on right edge
     
         Text ending at the right edge (the ls$buffer-fill-col(5)lm$buffer-fill-col(5)le), which
          commences from more that 50% of the page width is assumed to be
          right justified, non-wrapping. Typically used for addresses.

       Text centered

         Text which is centered on the page is assumed to be centered, this
          is non-wrapping.

       Indented

         All other text, not covered by the cases above is assumed to be
          available for filling. In this case the text is filled by the
          paragraph and left/right justification is applied, the fill
          default may be changed with ls$buffer-fill-mode(5)lm$buffer-fill-mode(5)le and changed with
          lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le.

    cDShort CutscA
    
       The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

       cDC-c C-hcA - Help information on current mode.  
       cDC-c C-scA - Spell the buffer.  
       cDC-c C-bcA - Fill both; perform left and right justification on the
                     margins.  
       cDC-c C-bcA - Fill center; center the text on the current line.  
       cDC-c C-lcA - Fill left; fill the text on the paragraph (ragged right
                     edge).  
       cDC-c C-rcA - Fill right; place text on right margin.  
       cDC-c C-ocA - Reduce a paragraph to a single line.  
       cDC-c acA - Move to automatic formatting mode (default).  
       cDC-c lcA - Change mode to left formating  
       cDC-c rcA - Change mode to right formating  
       cDC-c rcA - Change mode to both formating  
       cDC-c ccA - Change mode to center formating  
       cDC-c ncA - Change mode to no formating  


cENOTES cA


    To move text to a word processor then it is advised that all paragraphs
    are reduced to single lines, leading white space should be deleted (any
    possibly blank lines) and then import to the word processor. This saves
    considerable time as the word processor styles may be applied without
    handling spaces and band end of line characters.


cEMAGIC STRINGS cA


    cD-!- document -!-cA
    
       MicroEmacs specific tag, recognizes the file as a plain text document.
       No hilighting of the document is performed.

    cD-!- document; sectioned -!-cA
    
       MicroEmacs specific tag, recognizes the file as a document that
       contains sections. A crude section hilighting is enabled as follows:-

       Lines commencing with cD>cA are assumed to be comments, typically used at
       the head of the document .

               > -!- document; sectioned -!-
               >
               > Author:       My Self
               > Created:      11/11/97
               > Modified:     <211197.1003>
               > Location:     /xx/yy/zz.doc


       All lines commencing with start (cG*cA) are assumed to be bullet lists.
       Bullet is hilighted.

       All lines commencing with cG[a-zA-Z])cA or cG[0-9])cA are assumed to be minor
       sections. The section number is hilighted. e.g.:

               a) text
               1) text


       All text in single or double quotes is hilighted, assumed to be
       literal text. and are hilighted i.e. This is a cD"double quote"cA or cD'a'cA
       single quote.

       Lines commencing with underscore (cG_cA) are hilighted to the end.
       typically used as demarcation breaks or for section underlining

    cD-!- Document; pseudo-code -!-cA
    
       The document contains pseudo code, and the pseudo code is hilighted.
       The pseudo-code tokens are defined as follows:-

        cD//cA introduces a comment to the end of the line.

       Command words comprise:-
     
              BEGIN, BREAK, CASE, CLEAR, CONTINUE, DO, DONE, ELIF, ELSE, END,
              ENDIF, FOR, FUNCTION, GOTO, IF, ONEVENT, ONINTERRUPT, PROCEDURE,
              REPEAT, RETURN, SET, SWITCH, THEN, TO, UNTIL, WHILE,

       Pseudo logical operators include
     
              AND, FALSE, MOD, NOT, OR, TRUE, XOR,

    cD-!- document; sectioned; pseudo-code -!-cA
    
       A combination of both of the above.


cEBUGS cA


    The automatic mode sometimes mistakes an indented paragraph for a centered
    paragraph. This only typically occurs when the first line of the paragraph
    is not filled to the right. When the formatting error occurs, simply pad
    the line out so that it extends past the fill column and re-apply the
    formatting.

    Unfortunately there is nothing that can be done to alleviate this problem,
    but it occurs infrequently.

    cD.f77cA - Fortran 77 file  
    cD.f90cA - Fortran 90 file


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDf90cA file type templates provide simple hilighting of Fortran 77 and
    Fortran 90 files, the template provides minimal hilighting of both
    language syntaxes, which are overloaded into the same file.

    The major difference between the file types, apart from the new reserved
    words, is the comments. In Fortran 90 comments are introduced with cD!cA,
    while the other types use a cDccA in column 0.


    cDGeneral EditingcA
    
       On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
       the file. lstime(2m)lmtime(2m)le is by default enabled, allowing the modification
       time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

    cDHilightingcA
    
       The hilighting features allow functions, subroutines, variables, logical, comments,
       strings and characters of the language to be differentiated and
       rendered in different colors.

    cDFolding and Information HidingcA
    
       Generic folding is enabled within the cDf90cA files. The folds occur about
       cDfunctioncA, cDsubroutinecA, cDprogramcA,  and cDendcA text located on the left-hand margin.

      - lscollapse-all(3)lmcollapse-all(3)le - (un)folds  all regions in the file, 
      - lscollapse-current(3)lmcollapse-current(3)le - (un)folds the current region. 

    cDNavigation via Item ListcA

       The Fortan mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying
       an outline of the functions, subroutine, module and programp definitions
       of the Fortran file for easy  navigation using the lsitem-list(3)lmitem-list(3)le command.

    cDAbbreviationscA

       The  installation  comes with a default  abbreviation  file for Fortran 90
       file  editing  which  can  be  used  by  writing  short   abbreviations
       like   cC"if"cA  cC"wh"cA (while), or cC"fu"cA (function) - and then pressing
       the key-binding for the  lsexpand-abbrev-handle(3)lmexpand-abbrev-handle(3)le command.  
       The  list  of  abbreviations  can be used  interactively  in the GUI version of
       MicroEmacs using the lsabbrev-list(3)lmabbrev-list(3)le command.

    cDShort CutscA
    
       The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

       cDC-c C-ccA - Comment out the current line.  
       cDC-c C-dcA - Uncomment the current line.

       cDf6cA - Display the item list.
       cDesc f6cA - Hide the item list.

    cDExecuting, Formatting and LintingcA

      cD%fhook-fortran-execcA - The command to execute the current Fortran file, 
        default on Unix systems  is set to cC"gfortran %f -o %b && ./%b"cA where 
        cC%fcA represents the file name and cC%bcA the basename of the current file
        on Windows the slash is replaced with a backslash
              
      cD%fhook-fortran-formatcA - The command to format current Fortran file,
        default is set to cC"fprettify %"cA if the program is installed. 
        On a Unix system you might install it using the Python package manager
         like this: cC"pip3 install fprettify --user"cA.

      cD%fhook-fortran-lintcA - The command to check/lint the current Fotran file, 
         default is set to cC"gfortran -fsyntax-only %f"cA where cC%fcA represents
         the file name.
    
      The setting assume that the Gnu Fortran compiler and the cGfprettifycA formatter
      is available via the cCPATHcA environment variable. 
      On Windows you must insert here either the complete cCPATHcA to the 
      cGgfortrancA executable or add the folder where this file is to the cCPATHcA variable.

      These global variables should be changed if necessary usually within your cCUSERNAME.emfcA 
      or the cCmyfortran.emfcA file.

    above i.e. cDbashcA shells.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDshellcA file type template provides simple hilighting of the shell
    files.  It offers as well folding and support for displaying and outline
    of the functions of the shell script for easy navigation using the 
    lsitem-list(3)lmitem-list(3)le  command and expanding abbreviations either via short 
    strings using the lsexpand-abbrev-handle(3)lmexpand-abbrev-handle(3)le command and visual
    inserting abbreviations using the lsabbrev-list(3)lmabbrev-list(3)le macro.

    cDFolding and Information HidingcA
    
       Generic folding is enabled within the Shell files. The folds occur about the
       function keyword and closing braces cGfunction...{...}cA located on the
       left-hand margin. The following commands are supported to show and hide
       the function bodies. 
       
       lscollapse-all(3)lmcollapse-all(3)le -  (un)folds all regions in the file,  
       lscollapse-current(3)lmcollapse-current(3)le - (un)folds the current region.

    cDList ItemscA

       Item listing is available and the key constructs of the file may be listed
       using  the lsitem-list(3)lmitem-list(3)le command.

    cDAbreviationscA

       The installation comes with a default abbreviation file for shell editing
       which can be used by writing short abbreviations like "cCforcA", "cCifcA" or "cCfuncA" - 
       for a Bourne shell or Z-shell function - and then pressing the key-binding for
       the lsexpand-abbrev-handle(3)lmexpand-abbrev-handle(3)le  command. The list
       of abbreviations can be used interactively in the GUI version of MicroEmacs
       using the  lsabbrev-list(3)lmabbrev-list(3)le command.

    cDShort CutscA
          
       The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

       cDC-c C-ccA - Comment out the current line.  
       cDC-c C-dcA - Uncomment the current line.  
       cDC-c C-ecA - Comment to the end of the line with stars (*).  
       cDA-C-icA   - Restyle the current region.  
       cDesc qcA   - Format a comment.  
       cDesc ocA   - Format a comment.  
       cDf2cA      - (un)fold the current region  
       cDf3cA      - (un)fold all regions
       cDf6cA      - show the item-list outline
       cDEsc f6cA  - hide the item-list outline

cENOTES cA

    The file hook is implemented in the  cDshell.emfcA  file, the  abbreviations
    are placed within  the cDshell.eafcA file, the template for the initialization
    of the new file is defined in the  cDshell.etfcA file. To add your own
    abbreviations or your own template copy these files to your  config folder 
    and edit them within this folder.

cEBUGS cA


    Functions  defined without using the function  keyword can't currenly folded
    and as well do not appear in the item-list outline.

    There is a heavy bias towards Bourne, Korn and Zsh shells. The author is
    not a csh shell user so has probably missed a lot of csh features.

    definitions, utilising the electric 'C' features for automatic layout of
    text.

    cDGeneral EditingcA
    
       On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
       the file. lstime(2m)lmtime(2m)le is by default enabled, allowing the modification
       time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

    cDHilightingcA
    
       The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
       preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
       language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

    cDAuto LayoutcA
    
       The C-Mode lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le performs automatic layout of the text.

       lsrestyle-region(3)lmrestyle-region(3)le and lsrestyle-buffer(3)lmrestyle-buffer(3)le are available to reformat
       (re-layout) selected sections of the buffer, or the whole buffer,
       respectively.

       Comments may be formatted using `esc o`, which reformats the comments
       according to the current fill paragraph. If a comment commences with
       cG/***...cA then the comment is automatically formatted to a box.

    cDAbreviationscA

       The installation comes with a default abbreviation file for Java editing
       which can be used by writing short abbreviations like "cCfocA", "cCifcA" or "cCclcA" (class) 
       for Java classes functions. The list of abbreviations can be used as well interactively in the GUI
       version of MicroEmacs using the  lsabbrev-list(3)lmabbrev-list(3)le command.

    cDFolding and Information HidingcA
    
       Generic folding is enabled within the Java files. The folds occur
       about braces cD{cA...cD}cA located on the left-hand margin. lscollapse-all(3)lmcollapse-all(3)le
       (un)folds all regions in the file, lscollapse-current(3)lmcollapse-current(3)le (un)folds the
       current region. Note that folding does not operate on K&R style code,
       with the trailing open brace.

    cDTagscA
    
       A c-tags file may be generated within the editor using the cDToolscA ->
       cDJava-ToolscA -> cDCreate Tag FilecA. lsfind-tag(2)lmfind-tag(2)le takes the user to the file
       using the tag information.

       On invoking the tag generator then the user is presented with a dialog
       box which specifies the generation option of the tags file. The base
       directory of the tags file search and tagging options may be specified
       to locate all of the definitions within the code space.

       The cDtagscA file is extremely useful where the user is dealing with
       inherited source code spread over multiple directories. Generation of
       a recursive tag file with all searching options enabled allows labels
       to be located extremely rapidly (certainly faster than IDE
       environments).

    cDWorking EnvironmentcA
    
       lscompile(3)lmcompile(3)le may be invoked to rebuild the source, the user is prompted
       to save any files.

       lsrcs-file(2)lmrcs-file(2)le is automatically invoked if an RCS file is detected, the
       normal check-in/out operations may be performed through the editor.

    cDShort CutscA
    
       The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

       cDC-c C-ccA - Comment out the current line.  
       cDC-c C-dcA - Uncomment the current line.  
       cDC-c C-ecA - Comment to the end of the line with stars (*).  
       cDA-C-icA - Restyle the current region.  
       cDesc qcA - Format a comment.  
       cDesc ocA - Format a comment.  
       cDf2cA - (un)fold the current region  
       cDf3cA - (un)fold all regions
       cDf6cA      - show the item-list outline
       cDEsc f6cA  - hide the item-list outline

       MicroEmacs 2009 recognizes the magic string on the first line of the
       file used to locate the executable. The Tcl files may be extension
       less and are still recognized.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDtclcA file type template provides hilighting and automatic formatting features,
    in addition to a number of tools to handle the file type.

    File recognition is performed using the standard file extension cD.tclcA, cD.tkcA
    or by the magic string.

    cDGeneral EditingcA
    
       On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
       the file. lstime(2m)lmtime(2m)le is by default enabled, allowing the modification
       time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

    cDHilightingcA
    
       The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
       preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
       language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

    cDAuto LayoutcA
    
       The lsindent(2)lmindentation mechanismle is enabled which performs automatic layout
       of the text. lsrestyle-region(3)lmrestyle-region(3)le and lsrestyle-buffer(3)lmrestyle-buffer(3)le are available to
       reformat (re-layout) selected sections of the buffer, or the whole
       buffer, respectively.

    cDTagscA
    
       A Tcl-tags file may be generated within the editor using the cDToolscA ->
       cDTcl-ToolscA -> cDCreate Tag FilecA. lsfind-tag(2)lmfind-tag(2)le takes the user to the file
       using the tag information.

    cDFolding and Information HidingcA
    
       Generic folding is enabled within the Tclfiles. The folds occur
       about procedures or class defintions located on the left-hand margin. 
       lscollapse-all(3)lmcollapse-all(3)le (un)folds all regions in the file, 
       lscollapse-current(3)lmcollapse-current(3)le (un)folds the current region. 
       Note that folding does not operate on K&R style code.

    cDNavigation via Item ListcA

       Item listing is available and the key constructs of the file may be listed
       using  the lsitem-list(3)lmitem-list(3)le command.

    cDAbreviationscA

       The installation comes with a default abbreviation file for Tcl editing
       which can be used by writing short abbreviations like "cCforcA", "cCifcA" or "cCproccA" - 
       for Tcl functions. More extended abbreviations are "cCmaincA" for an Tcl
       application outline or "cCooclcA" for an cCoo::classcA template. The short strings
       are then replaced by pressing the key-binding for the lsexpand-abbrev-handle(3)lmexpand-abbrev-handle(3)le
       command. The list of abbreviations can be used as well interactively in the GUI
       version of MicroEmacs using the  lsabbrev-list(3)lmabbrev-list(3)le command.

    cDShort CutscA
    
       The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

       cDC-c C-ccA - Comment out the current line.  
       cDC-c C-dcA - Uncomment the current line.  
       cDC-c C-ecA - Comment to the end of the line with stars (*).

       cDf2cA - (un)fold the current region  
       cDf3cA - (un)fold all regions  
       cDf6cA      - show the item-list outline
       cDEsc f6cA  - hide the item-list outline

      cD%fhook-tcl-execcA - The command to execute the current Tcl file, default on Unix systems
              is set to cC"tclsh %f"cA where cC%fcA represents the file name of 
              the current script
              
      cD%fhook-tcl-formatcA - The command to format current Tcl file, default  
              is set to cC"tclfmt --in-place %f"cA  where cC%fcA represents the file name.
              The cCtclfmtcA program can be installed using the cCpip3cA package manager like this:
              cC`pip3 install tclint --user`cA
              
      cD%fhook-tcl-lintcA - The command to check/lint the current Tcl file, 
              default is set to cC"tclint %f"cA where cC%fcA represents the file name.

cEEXTENSIONS cA


    cD.mancA - UNIX manual page file


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDmancA provides the hilighting of UNIX manual pages, generally acquired
    through the lsman(3)lmman(3)le command, via a pipe. cCmancA references within the
    displayed manual page may be accessed using the mouse in a hypertext
    fashion.

    cDHilightingcA
    
       The hilighting commands recognize the manual page cCboldcA and cCunderlinecA
       character sequences and transpose these into the appropriate character
       hilighting. The hilighting sequences are generally unpleasant because
       they also remove the characters for display.

       The multitude of different platforms causes problems as different
       vendors produce different character sequences for cCboldcA/cCitaliccA text,
       hence on some platforms it may be necessary to add additional
       hilighting rules to cater for any local variations.

    cDShort CutscA
    
       Selecting a link node within the manual page using the mouse (i.e. a
       reference to another manual page) then MicroEmacs 2009 attempts to
       find the manual page in the text and invokes lsman(3)lmman(3)le to render the
       page. This provides a crude hyper text mechanism simply using the
       manual page information itself.
     
       The lsman-clean(3)lmman-clean(3)le command can be used to remove all of the
       hilighting characters from the current manual page. This is the
       typical method of reducing a manual page to plain text.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDperlcA file type template provides the hilighting, indentation and tools
    definitions for a perl file.

    File recognition is performed using the standard file extension cD.plcA, cD.pmcA
    or by the magic string.

    cDGeneral EditingcA
    
       On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into

       rendered in different colors.

    cDAuto LayoutcA
    
       The lsindent(2)lmindentation mechanismle is enabled which performs automatic layout
       of the text. lsrestyle-region(3)lmrestyle-region(3)le and lsrestyle-buffer(3)lmrestyle-buffer(3)le are available to
       reformat (re-layout) selected sections of the buffer, or the whole
       buffer, respectively.

    cDFolding and Information HidingcA
    
       Generic folding is enabled within perl files. The folds occur about
       cCsubcA...cD}cA located on the left-hand margin. lscollapse-all(3)lmcollapse-all(3)le (un)folds all
       regions in the file, lscollapse-current(3)lmcollapse-current(3)le (un)folds the current region.

    cDNavigation via Item ListcA

       The MicroEmacs macro mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying
       an outline of the subroutines of the Perl file for easy 
       navigation using the lsitem-list(3)lmitem-list(3)le command.

    cDAbbreviationscA

       The  installation  comes with a default  abbreviation  file for Perl file editing
       which  can  be  used  by  writing  short   abbreviations like   "cCwhcA" (while), 
       "cCifcA" (if), or "cCsubcA" (subroutine) - and then pressing  the key-binding for the  
       lsexpand-abbrev-handle(3)lmexpand-abbrev-handle(3)le command.  
       The  list  of  abbreviations  can be used  interactively  in the GUI version of
       MicroEmacs using the lsabbrev-list(3)lmabbrev-list(3)le command.

    cDTagscA
    
       A C-tags file may be generated within the editor using the cDToolscA ->

       cDesc f6cA - Close list items window.  

    cDDebuggingcA
    
       Debugging a perl script can be done inside MicroEmacs by using the
       lsperldb(3)lmperldb(3)le command.

    cDExecuting, Formatting and LintingcA
    
      cD%fhook-perl-execcA - The command to execute the current Perl file, default on Unix systems
        is set to cC"perl %f"cA where cC%fcA represents the file name of the current script.
              
      cD%fhook-perl-formatcA - The command to format current Perl file, default is set to 
       cC"perltidy -b %f"cA  where cC%fcA represents the file name.  The cCperltidycA program can 
       be installed usually using the standard package manager or using the cpan utility of Perl.
              
      cD%fhook-perl-lintcA - The command to check/lint the current Perl file, default is set to 
       cC"perl -Mstrict -cw %f"cA where cC%fcA represents the file name.
       If the program cCperlcriticcA is available it is used instead using the following command line:
      cC`perlcritic --nocolor --verbose \"%%f:%%l:%%c: %%m\\n\" %f`cA
    
      The setting assume that the cCperlcA, the cCperltidycA and the cCperlcriticcA programs are available
      via the PATH environment variable. On Windows you must insert here either the complete PATH
      to the executables or add the folder where this file is to the PATH variable.

      These global variables should be changed if necessary usually within your cCUSERNAME.emfcA 
      or the cCmyperl.emfcA file. 

cEBUGS cA


    The flexibility of the perl language does cause some hilighting anomalies
    from time to time, typically with unbalanced quote characters. Most of the
    common exceptions have been caught, however there are a few syntax
    sequences that involve quotation marks that can cause problems.

cEMAGIC STRINGS cA


    cD<html>cA
    
       MicroEmacs 2009 recognizes the magic string on any of the first 4
       lines of the file. The HTML files may be extension-less and are still
       recognized.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDhtmlcA file type template provides simple hilighting of HTML files.
    Additionally, MicroEmacs 2009 is capable of rendering simple HTML files
    (without graphic content) into the current buffer and follow the hyper
    text links. The JASSPA HTML documentation may be viewed in this way.

    cDGeneral EditingcA
    
       HTML files may be edited or processed and rendered into the buffer.
       The cDUse Author ModecA option in the lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le dialog determines
       the edit mode on loading a HTML file; when set to cCcGNcAcA the page is
       rendered, cCcGYcAcA and the raw HTML file is presented. The default state is
       cCcGYcAcA.

    cDHilightingcA
    
       The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
       preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
       language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

    cDNavigation via Item ListcA

       The MicroEmacs macro mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying
       an outline of the headers of the HTML file for easy 
       navigation using the lsitem-list(3)lmitem-list(3)le command.

    cDAbbreviationscA

       The  installation  comes with a default  abbreviation  file for HTML file editing
       which  can  be  used  by  writing  short   abbreviations for tags and attributes.
       The  list  of  abbreviations  can be used  interactively  in the GUI version of
       MicroEmacs using the lsabbrev-list(3)lmabbrev-list(3)le command.

    cDShort CutscA
    
       The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

       cDC-c C-hcA - Help information.  
       cDC-c C-acA - Toggle the HTML author status.  
       cDhtml-spell-check-wordcA - spell check the current word.  
       cDf6cA - List items.  
       cDesc f6cA - Close list items window.  

    cDRendered ModecA
    
       In the non-author mode, the HTML file is extracted and rendered to the
       buffer. The hypertext links may be followed by selecting them with the
       mouse or using the cG<RETURN>cA key.

       The rendered mode is typically used to check HTML text after it has
       been authored from the editor. The rendered mode only caters for
       regular HTML 2.0 text. It does not handle tables or frames etc. (use a
       browser).

       Toggling between rendered and authoring mode, then the buffer should
       be killed as the translation is only performed when the file is read.

       The non-author mode can be permanently enabled by setting the Use
       Author Mode option in the lsbuffer-setup(3)lmbuffer-setup(3)le dialog to cCcGNcAcA. When set to N
       any HTML files loaded are automatically processed, and rendered
       according to their HTML content.


cENOTES cA


    The lsprint-buffer(2)lmprintle driver may be used to generate HTML from the contents of the
    buffer. Select the printer destination as cCbuffercA, and cCHTMLcA as the driver.
    The buffer being printed is converted to HTML and dumped in the print
    buffer.

    cD.htscA and cD.htpcA are computer generated extended HTML files used in the
    MicroEmacs 2009 documentation system.

       Recognized by GNU and MicroEmacs. Denotes a t/nroff type file, may be
       used in cD.1cA/cD.9cA, cD.tnicA and cD.socA files.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDnroffcA file type templates handle UNIX n/troff type files.

    cDGeneral EditingcA
    
       On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
       the file. lstime(2m)lmtime(2m)le is by default enabled, allowing the modification
       time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

    cDHilightingcA
    
       The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
       preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
       language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

    cDTagscA
    
       A C-tags file may be generated within the editor using the cDToolscA ->
       cDNroff-ToolscA -> cDCreate Tag FilecA. lsfind-tag(2)lmfind-tag(2)le takes the user to the file
       using the tag information. The tags are generated using the cD.XIcA
       keyword, this may not be standard for all nroff pages.

    cDFolding and Information HidingcA
    
       Generic folding is enabled within the C and C++ files. The folds occur
       about sections cD.ScA[cDHScA]...cD.ScA[cDHScA] located on the left-hand margin.
       lscollapse-all(3)lmcollapse-all(3)le (un)folds all regions in the file, lscollapse-current(3)lmcollapse-current(3)le
       (un)folds the current region. Note that folding does not operate on
       K&R style code.

    cDToolscA
    
       The nroff buffer provides a facility to toggle the hilighting of the
       buffer on and off. If font change inserts are used (cD\fBcA, cD\fRcA, etc),
       then the enclosed cDboldcA and cCitaliccA regions are hilighted, hiding the
       escape sequences. This allows the nroff text to be viewed in a more
       representative rendered format.

       The local buffer command cDamancA invokes, the following command sequence
       (defined in cGhkmancA) to render a nroff cDmancA file into a buffer window;-

               soelim <file> | tbl -TX | neqn | nroff -man | col -x


       The command cDtex2nrcA attempts to convert a lslatex(9)lmlatex(9)le file into an nroff
       file. The cClatexcA escape sequences are converted into their nroff
       equivalents. The command is only made available when an Nroff file is
       loaded (as the command is defined in the cGhknroff.emfcA file).

    cDShort CutscA
    
       The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

       cDC-c C-scA - Insert a font size escape character cD\S0cA.  
       cDC-c C-rcA - Insert a roman font escape character cD\fRcA.  
       cDC-c C-bcA - Insert a bold font escape character cD\fBcA.  
       cDC-c C-icA - Insert a italic font escape character cD\fIcA.  
       cDC-c C-ccA - Insert a courier font escape character cD\fCcA.  
       cDC-c C-pcA - Insert a previous font escape character cD\fPcA.  
       cDesc ocA, cDesc qcA - lsfill-paragraph(2)lmfill-paragraph(2)le fills paragraph to next cG.XXcA command.  
       cDC-c bcA - Bold region by inserting cD\fBcA .. cD\fRcA.  
       cDC-c ccA - Courier region by inserting cD\fCcA .. cD\fRcA.  
       cDC-c ccA - Italic region by inserting cD\fIcA .. cD\fRcA.  
       cDC-c C-hcA - Toggle hilighting on/off.  
       cDC-c C-&cA - Adds nroff padding cD\f&cA about words.  
       cDC-x C-&cA - Removes nroff padding cD\f&cA about words.  
       cDesc hcA - Nroff help.  

       __f2__ - (un)fold the current region  
       __f3__ - (un)fold all regions  


cEBUGS cA


    The nroff language template is heavily biased towards the cDmancA macros only
    and includes all of the extension macros used for generating the JASSPA
    hypertext documentation.

    The template in the current form has been used entirely by JASSPA in
    generating all of the documentation (cDHTMLcA, cDWinhelpcA, cDehfcA, cDPostScriptcA) used
    by MicroEmacs 2009. It does not include all of the troff/nroff keywords,
    or keywords for any of the standard macro packages.

    The JASSPA documentation preparation tools are proprietary and have not
    been made publicly available.

    cD^#![ \t]*/.*env[ \t]+pythoncA
    
       MicroEmacs 2009 recognizes the magic string on the first line of the
       file used to locate the executable. The Python files may be
       extension-less and are still recognized.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDpythoncA file type template provides simple hilighting of Python files,
    the template provides minimal hilighting.

    File recognition is performed using the standard file extension cD.pycA, or by
    the magic string.

    The Python file hook offers as well folding and support for displaying an outline
    of the functions and classes of the Python script for easy navigation using the 
    lsitem-list(3)lmitem-list(3)le  command and expanding abbreviations either via short strings using
    the lsexpand-abbrev-handle(3)lmexpand-abbrev-handle(3)le command and visually  inserting abbreviations using the
    lsabbrev-list(3)lmabbrev-list(3)le macro.

    cDFolding and Information HidingcA
    
       Generic folding is enabled within the Python files. The folds occur about the
       cDdefcA or  cDclasscA  keywords  located on the   left-hand  margin.  The following
       commands are supported to show and hide  the function bodies. 
       
       lscollapse-all(3)lmcollapse-all(3)le     -  (un)folds all regions in the file,  
       lscollapse-current(3)lmcollapse-current(3)le - (un)folds the current region.

    cDList ItemscA

       Item listing is available and the key constructs of the file may be listed
       using  the lsitem-list(3)lmitem-list(3)le command.

    cDAbreviationscA

       The installation comes with a default abbreviation file for Python editing
       which can be used by writing short abbreviations like "cCforcA", "cCifcA" or "cCdefcA" - 
       for Python functions. More extended abbreviations are "cCmaincA" for an Python
       application outline or "cCclasscA" for a Python class template. The short strings
       are then replaced by pressing the key-binding for the lsexpand-abbrev-handle(3)lmexpand-abbrev-handle(3)le
       command. The list of abbreviations can be used as well interactively in the GUI
       version of MicroEmacs using the  lsabbrev-list(3)lmabbrev-list(3)le command.

    cDShort CutscA
          
       The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

       cDC-c C-ccA - Comment out the current line.  
       cDC-c C-dcA - Uncomment the current line.  
       cDC-c C-ecA - Comment to the end of the line with stars (*).  
       cDA-C-icA   - Restyle the current region.  
       cDesc qcA   - Format a comment.  
       cDesc ocA   - Format a comment.  
       cDf2cA      - (un)fold the current region  
       cDf3cA      - (un)fold all regions
       cDf6cA      - show the item-list outline
       cDEsc f6cA  - hide the item-list outline

    cDExecuting, Formatting and LintingcA
    
      cD%fhook-python-execcA - The command to execute the current Python file, default on Unix systems
        is set to cC"python3 %f"cA where cC%fcA represents the file name of the current script.
              
      cD%fhook-python-formatcA - The command to format current Python file, default is set to
       cC"ruff format %f"cA  or cC"yapf -i %f"cA or cC"black -q %f"cA if one of these tools is available, 
       where again cC%fcA represents the file name.
       If you have installed them as Python packages, you should this variable to cC"python -m ruff"cA
       for instance.
              
      cD%fhook-python-lintcA - The command to check/lint the current Python file, default is set to 
       cC"ruff check %f"cA  or cC"pylint %f"cA if one of these tools is available cC%fcA represents the file name.
       If you have installed them as Python packages, you should this variable to cC"python -m pylint"cA
       for instance.
    
      The setting assume that the cCpython3cA, the cCruffcA or the cCyapfcA programs are available
      via the cCPATHcA environment variable. On Windows you must insert here either the complete
      file path to the executables or add the folder where this file is to the cCPATHcA variable.

      These global variables should be changed if necessary usually within your cCUSERNAME.emfcA 
      or the cCmypython.emfcA file. Here an example to use ruff as Python package based on a local
      install of Python into a virtual environment.
      
sB
          set-variable %fhook-python-exec "/home/username/venv/bin/python3 %f"
          set-variable %fhook-python-lint "/home/username/venv/bin/python3 -m ruff check %f"
          set-variable %fhook-python-format "/home/username/venv/bin/python3 -m ruff format %f"

cEBUGS cA


    There would appear to be too much applied hilighting in this file, it
    could probably do with rationalizing.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDadacA file type template provides simple highlighting of Ada files.

    cDGeneral EditingcA
    
       On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
       the file. lstime(2m)lmtime(2m)le is by default enabled, allowing the modification
       time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

    cDHighlightingcA
    
       The highlighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
       preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
       language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

    cDAbreviationscA

       The installation comes with a default abbreviation file for Ada file editing
       which can be used by writing short abbreviations like "cCfocA" (for), "cCifcA" or "cCwhcA" (while) - 
       for Ada code. The list of abbreviations can be used as well interactively in the GUI
       version of MicroEmacs using the  lsabbrev-list(3)lmabbrev-list(3)le command.

    cDFolding and Information HidingcA
    
       Generic folding is enabled, the folds occur about cDmodulecA and cDclasscA
       definitions located on the left-hand margin. lscollapse-all(3)lmcollapse-all(3)le (un)folds
       all regions in the file, lscollapse-current(3)lmcollapse-current(3)le (un)folds the current
       region.

    cDList ItemscA
    
       Item listing is available and the key constructs of the file may be
       listed in the cCitem-listcA.

cEcESYNOPSIS cEcA


    jst - JASSPA Structured Text


cEFILES cA


    cDhkjst.emfcA - Jasspa structured text file hook definition.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    JASSPA Structured Text (cDjstcA) is an ASCII text format which includes some
    reserved text constructs that allow quite complex word processor type
    documents to be constructed with the minimal amount of additional
    annotation and which remains readable in its raw ASCII form. The
    motivation for doing this is to quickly construct documents and notes for
    publication whilst editing within MicroEmacs.

    cDJSTcA is a richer mark-up than the simpler lsdoc(9)lmdoc(9)le file type.

    The main requirements of JST are:

    - Easy to remember.
    - Easily readable and can be highlighted well in MicroEmacs.
    - Well defined, i.e. not ambiguous so formating errors can be
          generated.
    - Extendable.
    - May be automatically reformatted.
    - Handle things like figure references and internal anchor and
          references.
    - Html and LaTeX output, possibly rtf and text.

    The syntax definition used by JST is defined in the next section.

    The JST template extensions include a number of converters that will
    syntax check the text and then format and export the text to a new
    presentation format that may be imported into a word processor or used
    directly in the generated form.


cEBASIC SYNTAX cA


    The syntax of JST reserves basic character sequences which may be
    unambiguously interpreted into document styling. The basic syntax set
    allows a simple formatted document to be produced with the minimal amount
    of work from the author.

    JST supports more advanced extensions which allow tables and hypertext
    tags to be defined, these are discussed in the cDAdvancedcA cDSyntaxcA section
    later.


cEQuoting  cA


    To ensure that all characters may be input as typed then there is no
    single escape character. The character sequence cD&[cA_<char>cD_]cA may be used to
    escape a character cC<char>cA. Our experience is that escaping is not usually
    necessary.


cEBasic Styling  cA


    The basic character styling is performed with a pair of escape characters
    at the start and end of a string sequence. The style end token does not
    have to appear on the same line as the start token and an error is
    reported if the sequence is not closed properly. Composite styles may be
    built buy combining the different tokens by inclusion of a new style
    within another style block. Where styles are nested then they should be
    closed in the reverse order that they were opened.

    `""Raw Text""`
    
       A pair of double quotes surrounding a text block is treated as
       verbatim and is not subject to escaping, that is the character format
       characters are not translated.

    cD**Bold Text**cA
    
       A pair of star characters denote a emboldened text region.

    cC//Italic Text//cA
    
       A forward slash pair denotes an italic text region.

    cD`cAUnderline TextcD`cA
 
        A underscore pair denotes an underlined region.

    `@@Mono Text@@`
    
       A pair of at symbols denotes a fixed text region rendered in a fixed
       width font.

    ``Superscript Text``
    
       A pair of grave accents denotes superscript text region.

    ,,Subscript Text,,
    
       A pair of commas denotes a subscript text region.

    Styles may be nested i.e. cG//Italic **Bold Italic** Italic Again//cA To get
    raw text with a double quote use: `""raw with a &["]" in it""`


cEStyling Paragraphs and Blocks  cA


    Blocks of text may be demarked by a single token at the start of the line.
    A exclamation mark cCcG!cAcA at the start of a paragraph may be followed by one
    or more style letters to enable the style for the paragraph, for
    consistency with the in-line tokens then double characters may be used.

        !* As an example this baragraph is bold as it started with a '!*'.


    produces

        cDAs an example this baragraph is bold as it started with a '!*'.cA

    The exclamation mark may be followed by multiple different styles which
    are applied together. e.g.

        !"@ This paragraph  started with '!"@' so it is quoted and mono-spaced
        style, i.e. @@, "" or ** is ignored.


    You can enable a style over a block of text by using a cCcG!cAcA style
    definition with no further text to the right. The block is terminated by a
    cCcG!end!cAcA or cCcG>end>cAcA tag on its own line. It is recommended that you insert
    a blank line before and after the cCcG!end!cAcA definition so that it does not
    affect the filling of the following paragraph.

        !end!


    Paragraphs may be associated with a literal block of text from a different
    programming language. These are introduced with a cCcG>type>cAcA tag and end
    with a cCcG>end>cAcA tag. The tag types that are currently supported include:

        `emf   ` - JASSPA MicroEmacs Macro file.
        `pseudo` - Pseudo code block.
        `bnf   ` - BNF block.
        `c     ` - ANSI C code block.
        `cpp   ` - C++ code block.
        `perl  ` - Perl code block.
        `tcl   ` - TCL code block.
        `shell ` - UNIX shell block.
        `java  ` - Java code block.
        `ini   ` - MS-DOS/Windows .ini code block
        `php   ` - PHP code block.
        `make  ` - Makefile fragment.

    The aforementioned blocks support syntax language highlighting and
    indentation. As an example:

               Some example 'C' code:
               >c>
               /* This is C code */
               int main (int argc, char *argv[])
               {
                   printf ("Hello World\n");
                   return 0;
               }
               >end>


cEJustification of Paragraphs and Blocks  cA


    A paragraph is a block of text delimited by an empty line, by default all
    paragraphs are left justified. Where the layout of the paragraph is
    literal and should not be re-formatted then the paragraph should be
    proceeded by a cCcG>cAcA symbol e.g.

         > This paragraph will not be reformatted
         because it starts with a '>', the
         output will respect the position of the new lines.


    Paragraphs may be center justified with a leading cCcG>ccAcA e.g.

         >c This is centered text


    With centered text then the indentation of the cCcG>ccAcA centers the text from
    the indent position. e.g.

                   >c Note the initial indent level is important
                   as the text is
                   centered w.r.t. the remainder.
 

    Text may be right justified with a leading cCcG>rcAcA.


cEIndentation  cA


    Indentation is implicitly defined by the indentation of the first line of
    the paragraph, each paragraph is effectively independent with respect to
    determining the indentation level.

    The indentation level is defined to be the the column of the first
    non-white-space character of the first line divided by the cCIndentcA cCWidthcA
    (see indent-setup) rounded up. For example this the first non-white of
    this paragraph is the 'F' at column 4, with an indent width of 4 (the
    default) this is a an indent level of 1.

    A line starting with 6 spaces so it has an indent level of 2 (6/4 == 1.5
    which is rounded up to 2). Rounding up allows item lists to work with
    little effort, without introducing ambiguity, for example.

    The indentation of a code fragment or literal text block are determined by
    the indentation of the initial style tag, for example:

               >"@"
               >c>
               int myVariable ;
               >end>
        >end>


    The code block is indented from the left paragraph by the starting block
    indent.


cEHeadings  cA


    Headings may be defined and commence with a equals (cCcG=cAcA) character as the
    first character of the line. The number of equals determines the heading
    level.

        = Top Level Heading
        == Sub-heading
        === Sub-sub-heading


    The position of the heading may be controlled and may be left, centered or
    right justified using cGlcA, cGccA or cGrcA respectively. Left justified is the
    default when not defined.

        =c Centered Top Level Heading
        ==r Right justified sub-heading


cEItem Lists  cA


    Items lists are bullet or number lists of items which are introduced by a
    cCformatCharcAcCcC.cAcA to start the list, subsequent list items are introduced with a
    period 'cCcC.cAcA' character only or optionally with the bullet character. Where
    cCformatCharcA identifies the type of list as follows:

        `*`  - bullet list.
        `1`  - Numeric item list.
        `a`  - Lowercase alphabetic list.
        `A`  - Uppercase alphabetic list.
        `i`  - Roman numeral list.
        `I`  - Upper case Roman numeral list.
        `:.` - Text item list.

    Indentation and sub-paragraphs are supported within the paragraph. e.g.

            1. Start or a numbered list.

               Sub-paragraph of numbered list.

            2. 2nd item in numbered list
 
               *. Contained bullet list.

                . 2nd item of bullet list.

            . 3rd item in numbered list.


    The text item, or definition, requires some further explanation. This
    allows a definition item to be defined (e.g. glossary of terms at start of
    document or note points within a document). These are defined at column 0
    e.g.

        :. MyDefinition

              Description of the term.


cEADVANCED SYNTAX cA


    This section defiens the advanced syntax extensions of JST which allow
    more complex documents to be generated. These extensions may be used to
    author more complex documents for export.


cETables  cA


    Quite complex tables may be supported through JST. A table is introduced
    with the closing square brace 'cCcC]cAcA character at the start of the line which
    define the ghlobal properties and dimensions of the table. Each entry in
    the table is introduced by 'cCcC]cAcA and is followed by the assigned content.

    The initial table definition has the syntax

        ]crh <# columns> <# rows>


    Where 'cDccD' and 'cArcD' are optional and center or right justify the table, 'cAhcA'
    hides the table lines i.e. no border. The dimensions of the table then
    follow.

    A simple definition of a 3x2 table might be defined as:

        ] 3 2

        ] Row 1 col 1 content.

        ] Row 1 col 2 content.
 
        ] Row 1 col 3 content.

        ] Row 2 col 1 content.

        ] Row 2 col 2 content.
 
        ] Row 2 col 3 content.


    The content may include

        `*.` Use item lists
        `. ` Like this
        `!c` Center text
        `!r` Right justify text
        _also embedded images, see later._

    Columns and rows may be joined both horizontally and vertically by
    specifying the join in the cell definition. 'cD]>'cA performs a horizontal
    cell join of two cells, a single 'cCcC>cAcA' should be added for each
    additional cell so 'cD]>>cA' joins 3 cells horizontally. A vertical join
    is similarly specified with 'cD]vcA'.

        ] 3 3

        ]>> Single top row with 3 columns joined content.

        ]v 2 rows joined in the first column content.

        ]> 2nd row 2nd and 3rd column joined content.

        ] 3rd row 2nd column content.

        ] 3rd row 3rd column content.


cESpecial Characters and Symbols  cA


    Special characters are introduced with 'cD&[cBspecialcA]cA' and are defined as
    follows:

    cG&[nl]cA or cG&[new-line]cA
    
       Newline.

    cG&[np]cA or cG&[new-page]cA
    
       New page. This is not supported in HTML or text.

    cG&[nf]cA or cG&[new-file]cA
    
       New file, the effect is dependent on the output format:

       cDhtml cA
     
         Starts a new html file, typical use of this is when the first file
          contains the TOC with links to the subsequent files.

       cDlatex cA
      
         Just starts a new page, i.e. same as [[np]].

       cDrtf cA
     
         Just starts a new page, i.e. same as [[np]].

       cDtext cA
     
          Ignored.

    cG&[toc]cA
    
       Inserts an automatically generated table of contents.

    cG---cA
    
       Inserts a horizontal line. This must be the only text on the line.


cETags and Hyperlinks  cA


    Most of the more complex formatting is performed with tags. The general
    format of a tag is defined as:

       cD&[cA_<tag-id><options> <args>cD_]cA

    If a argument contains a space or a 'cCcC]cAcA' then it must be quoted, e.g.:

        &[c this-is-okay]
        &[c "this is okay"]
        &[c "this [\"is\"] okay"]


    A tag may support numerous options, the order of the options is not
    important but the order of their arguments is as specified in the docs,
    not the order given with the tag therefore cD&[idw <image> <depth> <width>]cA
    is still cD&[iwd <image> <depth> <width>]cA. The text that actually appears in
    any generated document should not appear in a tag as the spelling check
    should skip the contents of a tag. This means that a link should take the
    HTML form of encasing the text label with start and end tags rather than
    being in the tag itself. One exception would be the setting of a variable.

    cDComment Tag cA
    
       Inserts a comment.

       cD&[ccA cC<0+args>cDcA]cA

       There may be any number of arguments, the whole tag is ignored. As the
       comment ends with a ']' and ']' char in the comment must be quoted,
       i.e.:

              &[c this is a comment with a "]" "char[23]" in it]


    cDAnchor Tag cA
    
       Internal document reference.

       cD&[acA cC<name>cDcA]cA

        An anchor tag can be placed anywhere and referenced by a link .

    cDForeground and Background Color Tag cA
    
       Modifies the color of the text foreground and background.

       cD&[fcA cC<color>cDcA]cD .... cA&[/f]cA

       Sets the current foreground color where cC<color>cA is either a direct
       HTML format color definition (e.g. cGcG#ff0000cAcA for cDredcA) or a previously
       defined color name.

       cD&[bcA cC<color>cDcA]cD .... cA&[/b]cA

       Sets similarly sets the current background color.

       A number of options are supported by the color tag as follows:

       cD&[fscA cC<name>cC cA<color>cDcA]cA
     
          Define color '<name>' to be '<color>', the <name> may be
           references in the f/b color references.

       cD&[fdcA cC<color>cDcA]cA
     
          Sets the default foreground color to <color>.

       cD&[bdcA cC<color>cDcA]cA
     
          Sets the default background color to <color>.

    cDLink Tag cA
    
       Link to another part of the document or URL.

       cD&[lcA cC<url>cDcA]cD .... cA&[/l]cA

       Creates a hyperlink with the text with cCcG....cAcA going to the cC<url>cA, The
       format of the url uses the standard HTML syntax, a link starting with
       a hash cCcG#cAcA is assumed to be local and a warning will be issued if the
       corresponding anchor point is not found. An error is generated if the
       cD&[/l]cA is missing.

       Urls appearing in the text like cCcGhttp://www.jasspa.comcAcA are
       automatically turned into links. To avoid this quote the string, i.e.
       ""http://www.jasspa.com""

    cDImage Tag cA
    
       Insert an image in the document.

       cD&[icA cC<image-name>cDcA]cA

       Inserts an image cC<image-name>cA, for example cD&[i me.png]cA

       Additional options allow the depth and width of the image to be
       specified:

       cD&[idwcA cC<image-name> <depth> <width>cDcA]cA

       Where option cDdcA specifies the depth of image and cDwcA specifies the width
       of the image. e.g. `&[iw test.jpg 60]`. The size is given in pixels and
       the conversion variable 'cCimage-ppicA' is used to convert is a physical
       paper size. The width may also be specified as a percentage, e.g. cD50%cA.

    cDUse Tag cA
    
       Insert a file at the current point.
     
            &[u <file-name>]

       Inserts cC<file-name>cA into the current location and processes it as if
       part of the original docuement. e.g. cG&[ucA cGinsert.jst]cA inserts the file
       cCinsert.jstcA at the current position in the file.

    cDVariable Tag cA
    
       Insert a variable.

       cD&[vcA cC<variable-name>cDcA]cA

       Inserts the current value of variable cC<variable-name>cA, variable names
       may only contain alphanumeric characters and cCcG-cAcA.

       The variable supports a set of simple options that allow the variable
       value to be manipulated prior to insertion e.g. for handling numbers
       etc. The option syntax is defined as follows:

       cD&[vdinrscA cC<variable-name>cC cA<value>cC cA<increment>cC cA<reference-name>cDcA]cA

       cDdcA
              Define the reference <reference-name> for the current value.

       cDicA
              Pre-increment the variable value by <increment> prior to
              insertion.

       cDncA
              Do not insert the variable value.

       cDrcA
              Insert the <reference-name> value.

       cDs cA
              Set the value to <value> first.

       As an example, consider the following sequence to implement figure
       labels and reference them:

              &[vsn figure 0]

              &[i figure1.jpg]
              Figure &[vid figure 1 figA] - my first figure

              some more text

              &[i figure2.jpg]
              Figure &[vid figure 1 figB] - my second figure

              To see  **figure &[vr figure  figA]** //my first  figure// and **figure
              &[vr figure figB]** //my second figure//.

              To see  **figure &[vr figure  figA]** //my first  figure// and **figure
              &[vr figure figB]** //my second figure//.


       An undefined variable has a value of cGcGERRORcAcA, it can be defined by
       using either option 'cDscD' or 'cAicA' in which case the value is cG0cA, i.e. the
       following can be used

       `= Chapter 1: Will be 1 at the top of the doc`

       A set of special variables are automatically defined:

       cDtitle cA
              The document title.

       cDauthor cA
              The author

       cDimage-ppi cA
              Image pixels per inch resolution setting, this is the resolution
              of the generated document in inches.

    cDOutput Dump Tag cA
    
       Dump output text.

       cD&[ocA cC<out-type> <raw-text>cDcA]cA

       Dumps cC<raw-text>cA into the output if the target output type is
       cC<out-type>cA, where cC<out-type>cA can be cDallcA, cDhtmlcA, cDlatexcA, cDrtfcA and cDtextcA.

    cDDump Tag cA
    
       Dumps the tag for processing.

       cD[dcA cC<out-type> <text>cDcA]cA

       This command is similar to Output Dump Tag except this is done first
       so the cC<text>cA is processed, this can be used to define output specific
       formatting, e.g. (note that the \ at the end of the line is used here
       to show that the content should be placed on a single line).

              &[d html "&[vsn large-font-start \"..html def..\"] \
                        &[vsn large-font-end \"..html def..\"]"]
              &[d latex "&[vsn large-font-start \"..latex def..\"] \
                         &[vsn large-font-end \"..latex def..\"]"]
              &[d text "&[vsn large-font-start \"\"]&[vsn large-font-end \"\"]"]


       so in the main body of the text:

              &[v large-font-start] Large Text &[v large-font-end]


       This is a complex concept and is beyond most users requirements, but
       making this kind of thing possible means that users should be able to
       do whatever they need to.


cETEMPLATE cA


    The template supports highlighting and indention including commands for
    exporting JST to another format:

    cDjst-to-htm cA
    
       Export the JST definition to an HTML file with cD.htmcA extension.

    cDjst-to-html cA
    
       Export the JST definition to an HTML file with cD.htmcA extension.

    cDjst-to-rtf cA
    
       Export the JST definition to an RTF file, for this export then the
       file name is cD.rtfcA but the content is HTML. cDWord(1)cA and cDStarOffice(1)cA
       know how to convert this when imported.

    cDjst-to-latex cA
    
       Convert to a LaTeX file format.


cEFILES cA


    JST is controlled by the macro files cGhkjst.emfcA which contains the basic
    template. cGjstutl.emfcA includes the utilities used for conversion to other
    formats.


cEINTERNAL FORMAT cA


    cDJSTcA uses an internal neutral format which is used in the conversion
    process, this allows different back end output format drivers to be
    written against the neutral format without dealing with the input syntax.
    This intermediate format is not visible to the user and does not exist in
    the output. The internal format is defined as follows:

    cD\bF?cA....cD\bf?cA
    
       Font style change where cD?cA is cDBcA,cDIcA,cDUcA,cDMcA,cDpcA,cDbcA).

       MicroEmacs 2009 recognizes the magic string on the first line of the
       file used to locate the executable. The R files may be
       extension-less and are still recognized.


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDRcA file type template provides simple hilighting of R files,
    the template provides minimal hilighting.

    File recognition is performed using the standard file extension cD.rcA, or cD.RcA or by
    the magic string.

    The R file hook offers as well folding and support for displaying an outline
    of the functions of the R script for easy navigation using the lsitem-list(3)lmitem-list(3)le command
    and expanding abbreviations either via short strings using the 
    lsexpand-abbrev-handle(3)lmexpand-abbrev-handle(3)le command and visually inserting abbreviations
    using the lsabbrev-list(3)lmabbrev-list(3)le macro.

    cDAbbreviationscA

       The installation comes with a default abbreviation file for R editing
       which can be used by writing short abbreviations like "cCforcA", "cCifcA" or "cCfunccA" - 
       for R functions. More extended abbreviations are "cCmaincA" for an Rscript
       application outline or "cCopenrcA" and "cCopenwcA" for reading and writing text files.
       The short strings  are then replaced by pressing the key-binding for the 
       lsexpand-abbrev-handle(3)lmexpand-abbrev-handle(3)le  command.
       The list of abbreviations can be used as well interactively in the GUI version 
       of MicroEmacs using the  lsabbrev-list(3)lmabbrev-list(3)le command.

    cDFolding and Information HidingcA
    
       Generic folding is enabled within the R files. The folds occur about the
       function definitions  located on the   left-hand  margin using the smaller-minus
       assignment operator. 
       The following  commands are supported to show and hide  the function bodies. 
       
       lscollapse-all(3)lmcollapse-all(3)le     - (un)folds all regions in the file,  
       lscollapse-current(3)lmcollapse-current(3)le - (un)folds the current region.

    cDNavigation via Item ListcA

       The R mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying an outline
       of the functions and classes of the R file for easy navigation using the 
       lsitem-list(3)lmitem-list(3)le command.

    cDShort CutscA
          
       The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

       cDC-c C-ccA - Comment out the current line.  
       cDC-c C-dcA - Uncomment the current line.  
       cDC-c C-ecA - Comment to the end of the line with stars (*).  
       cDA-C-icA   - Restyle the current region.  
       cDesc qcA   - Format a comment.  
       cDesc ocA   - Format a comment.  
       cDf2cA      - (un)fold the current region  
       cDf3cA      - (un)fold all regions
       cDf6cA      - show the item-list outline
       cDEsc f6cA  - hide the item-list outline

    cD.gocA - Go


cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDgocA file type templates share much with the lsc(9)lmc(9)le template
    definitions, utilising the electric 'C' features for automatic layout of
    text.

    cDGeneral EditingcA
    
       On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
       the file. lstime(2m)lmtime(2m)le is by default enabled, allowing the modification
       time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

    cDHilightingcA
    
       The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
       preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
       language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

    cDAuto LayoutcA
    
       The C-Mode lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le performs automatic layout of the text.

       lsrestyle-region(3)lmrestyle-region(3)le and lsrestyle-buffer(3)lmrestyle-buffer(3)le are available to reformat
       (re-layout) selected sections of the buffer, or the whole buffer,
       respectively.

       Comments may be formatted using `esc o`, which reformats the comments
       according to the current fill paragraph. If a comment commences with
       cG/***...cA then the comment is automatically formatted to a box.

    cDFolding and Information HidingcA
    
       Generic folding is enabled within the Go files. The folds occur
       about the cDfunccA keyword and a closing curly brace, both at the
       beginning of a line. 

      - lscollapse-all(3)lmcollapse-all(3)le (un)folds all regions in the file, 
      - lscollapse-current(3)lmcollapse-current(3)le (un)folds the current region. 

    cDNavigation via Item ListcA

       The Go mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying an outline
       of the functions and classes of the Go file for easy navigation using the 
       lsitem-list(3)lmitem-list(3)le command.

    cDAbbreviationscA

       The  installation  comes with a default  abbreviation  file for Go files  editing
       which  can  be  used  by  writing  short   abbreviations   like   "cCforcA",
       "cCifcA", "cCelifcA" or "cCtypecA" - and then pressing the key-binding for the 
       lsexpand-abbrev-handle(3)lmexpand-abbrev-handle(3)le command.  
       The  list  of  abbreviations  can be used  interactively  in the GUI version of
       MicroEmacs using the lsabbrev-list(3)lmabbrev-list(3)le command.

    cDWorking EnvironmentcA
    
       lscompile(3)lmcompile(3)le may be invoked to rebuild the source, the user is prompted
       to save any files.

    cDShort CutscA
    
       The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

       cDC-c C-ccA - Comment out the current line.  
       cDC-c C-dcA - Uncomment the current line.  
       cDC-c C-ecA - Comment to the end of the line with stars (*).  
       cDA-C-icA - Restyle the current region.  
       cDesc qcA - Format a comment.  
       cDesc ocA - Format a comment.  
       cDf2cA - (Un)fold the current region.  
       cDf3cA - (Un)fold all regions.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDdartcA file type templates share much with the lsc(9)lmc(9)le template
    definitions, utilising the electric 'C' features for automatic layout of
    text.

    cDGeneral EditingcA
    
       On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
       the file. lstime(2m)lmtime(2m)le is by default enabled, allowing the modification
       time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

    cDHilightingcA
    
       The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
       preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
       language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

    cDAuto LayoutcA
    
       The C-Mode lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le performs automatic layout of the text.

       lsrestyle-region(3)lmrestyle-region(3)le and lsrestyle-buffer(3)lmrestyle-buffer(3)le are available to reformat
       (re-layout) selected sections of the buffer, or the whole buffer,
       respectively.

       Comments may be formatted using `esc o`, which reformats the comments
       according to the current fill paragraph. If a comment commences with
       cG/***...cA then the comment is automatically formatted to a box.

    cDFolding and Information HidingcA
    
       Generic folding is enabled within the Dart files. The folds occur around
       function and class definitions and ends at a closing curly brace, both at the
       beginning  of a line.

      - lscollapse-all(3)lmcollapse-all(3)le - (un)folds  all regions in the file, 
      - lscollapse-current(3)lmcollapse-current(3)le - (un)folds the current region. 

    cDNavigation via Item ListcA

       The Dart mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying an outline
       of the functions and classes of the Dart file for easy navigation using the 
       lsitem-list(3)lmitem-list(3)le command.

    cDAbbreviationscA

       The  installation  comes with a default  abbreviation  file for Dart file  editing
       which  can  be  used  by  writing  short   abbreviations   like   "cCforcA",
       "cCifcA", "cCelifcA" or "cCclasscA" - and then pressing the key-binding for the 
       lsexpand-abbrev-handle(3)lmexpand-abbrev-handle(3)le command.  
       The  list  of  abbreviations  can be used  interactively  in the GUI version of
       MicroEmacs using the lsabbrev-list(3)lmabbrev-list(3)le command.

    cDWorking EnvironmentcA
    
       lscompile(3)lmcompile(3)le may be invoked to rebuild the source, the user is prompted
       to save any files. The command lsfile-exec(3)lmfile-exec(3)le can be called
       to run the currently edited Dart file, the command lsfile-format(3)lmfile-format(3)le
       can be called to reformat the current dart file and the command lsfile-lint(3)lmfile-lint(3)le
       can be used to check the current file for possible problems.
       
    cDShort CutscA
    
       The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

       cDC-c C-ccA - Comment out the current line.  
       cDC-c C-dcA - Uncomment the current line.  
       cDC-c C-ecA - Comment to the end of the line with stars (*).  
       cDA-C-icA - Restyle the current region.  
       cDesc qcA - Format a comment.  
       cDesc ocA - Format a comment.  
       cDf2cA - (Un)fold the current region.  
       cDf3cA - (Un)fold all regions.  
       cDf6cA - Display the item list.
       cDesc f6cA - Hide the item list.

    cDExecuting, Formatting and LintingcA
    
      cD%fhook-dart-execcA - The command to execute the current dart file, default
         is set to cC"dart run %f"cA where %f represents the file name  
      cD%fhook-dart-formatcA - The command to format current dart file, default  
         is set to cC"dart format %f"cA where %f represents the file name  
      cD%fhook-dart-lintcA - The command to check/lint the current dart file, 
         default is set to cC"dart analyze %f"cA 
    
      The setting assume that the cCdartcA compiler is available via the cCPATHcA
      environment variable. On Windows you must insert here either the complete cCPATHcA to the 
      cCdartcA executable or add the folder where this file is in to the cCPATHcA variable.

      These global variables should be changed if necessary usually within your cCUSERNAME.emfcA 
      or the cCmydart.emfcA file. 
    
cENOTES cA


    The hilighting is typically extended using a file cDmydart.emfcA located
    within the users configuration folder, usually cC~/.jasspacA.

      These global variables should be changed if necessary usually within your cCUSERNAME.emfcA 
      or the cCmyv.emfcA file. 

cENOTES cA


    The hilighting is typically extended using a file cDmyv.emfcA. As this language
    shares the same extensions as Verilog files you might be adding the add the 
    following line to your user emf file.
    
       add-file-hook ".v" fhook-v
    
    As an alternative you can add the following first line to your V-files so that
    they are automatically recognized as V language files and not as Verilog files.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    The cDrustcA file type templates share much with the lsc(9)lmc(9)le template definitions,
    utilising the electric 'C' features for automatic layout of text.

    cDGeneral EditingcA
    
       On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
       the file. lstime(2m)lmtime(2m)le is by default enabled, allowing the modification
       time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

    cDHilightingcA
    
       The hilighting features allow commands, variables, logical,
       preprocessor definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
       language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

    cDAuto LayoutcA
    
       The C-Mode lsindent(2)lmindent(2)le performs automatic layout of the text.

       lsrestyle-region(3)lmrestyle-region(3)le and lsrestyle-buffer(3)lmrestyle-buffer(3)le are available to reformat
       (re-layout) selected sections of the buffer, or the whole buffer,
       respectively.

       Comments may be formatted using `esc o`, which reformats the comments
       according to the current fill paragraph. If a comment commences with
       cG/***...cA then the comment is automatically formatted to a box.

    cDFolding and Information HidingcA
    
       Generic folding is enabled within the Rust files. The folds occur
       about the cDfncA keyword and a closing curly brace, both at the
       beginning of a line. Furthermore cDimplcA sections for method definitions
       of classes are foldable. 
       
       - lscollapse-all(3)lmcollapse-all(3)le (un)folds all regions in the file,
       - lscollapse-current(3)lmcollapse-current(3)le (un)folds the current region. 

    cDNavigation via Item ListcA

       The Rust mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying an outline
       of the functions, modules, classes and their methods of the Rust file for easy 
       navigation using the lsitem-list(3)lmitem-list(3)le command.

    cDAbbreviationscA

       The  installation  comes with a default  abbreviation  file for Rust file
       editing which  can  be  used  by  writing  short   abbreviations like
       "cCforcA", "cCifcA", "cCelifcA" or "cCfncA" - and then pressing the key-binding
       for the lsexpand-abbrev-handle(3)lmexpand-abbrev-handle(3)le command.  
       The  list  of  abbreviations  can be used  interactively  in the GUI version of
       MicroEmacs using the lsabbrev-list(3)lmabbrev-list(3)le command.

    cDWorking EnvironmentcA
    
       lscompile(3)lmcompile(3)le may be invoked to rebuild the source, the user is prompted
       to save any files.

    cDShort CutscA
    
       The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

       cDC-c C-ccA - Comment out the current line.  
       cDC-c C-dcA - Uncomment the current line.  
       cDC-c C-ecA - Comment to the end of the line with stars (*).  
       cDA-C-icA - Restyle the current region.  
       cDesc qcA - Format a comment.  
       cDesc ocA - Format a comment.  
       cDf2cA - (Un)fold the current region.  
       cDf3cA - (Un)fold all regions.  
       cDf6cA - Display the item list.
       cDesc f6cA - Hide the item list.

    cDExecuting, Formatting and LintingcA

      cD%fhook-rust-execcA - The command to execute the current Rust file, default
         is set to cC"rustc %f -o %b && ./%b"cA where %f represents the file name 
         and %b the the filename without extension 
      cD%fhook-rust-formatcA - The command to format current Rust file, default  
         is set to cC"rustfmt  %f"cA where %f represents the file name  
      cD%fhook-rust-lintcA - The command to check/lint the current Rust file, 
         default is set to cC"rustc %f"cA 
    
      These  settings  assume  that  the  cCRustcA  compiler  (cCrustccA) and the cCRustcA  
      formatter (cCrustfmtcA) are available via the _PATH environment variable. 
      On Windows you must insert here either the complete  PATH to the cCrustccA executable
      or add the folder where this file is to the PATH variable.

      These global variables should be changed if necessary usually within your cCUSERNAME.emfcA 
      or the cCmyrust.emfcA file.

    The Graphviz cDdotcA file type macro file provides simple hilighting of dot files,
    abbreviations to fastly insert specific text snippetss and item-list and folding 
    for subgraphs.

    File recognition is performed using the standard file extension cD.dotcA.

    cDFolding and Information HidingcA
    
       Generic folding is enabled within the Dot files. The folds occur about the
       subgraph opening brace and and the closing curly brace of this subgraph. 
       The subgraph keyword and the closing curly brace should be both the first
       none whitespace character on their line.

       The following commands are supported to show and hide  the subgraph bodies. 
       
       lscollapse-all(3)lmcollapse-all(3)le     - (un)folds all regions in the file,  
       lscollapse-current(3)lmcollapse-current(3)le - (un)folds the current region.

cEDESCRIPTION cA


    cDGeneral EditingcA
    
       On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into
       the file. lstime(2m)lmtime(2m)le is by default enabled, allowing the modification
       time-stamp to be maintained in the header.

    cDHilightingcA
    
       The hilighting features allow keywords, variables, logicals,
       or function definitions, comments, strings and characters of the
       language to be differentiated and rendered in different colors.

    cDAuto LayoutcA
    
       lsrestyle-region(3)lmrestyle-region(3)le and lsrestyle-buffer(3)lmrestyle-buffer(3)le are available to reformat
       (re-layout) selected sections of the buffer, or the whole buffer,
       respectively.

       Comments may be formatted using `esc o`, which reformats the comments
       according to the current fill paragraph.

    cDFolding and Information HidingcA
    
       Generic folding is enabled within the octave files. The folds occur
       about the cDfunctioncA  keyword and a closing  cDendfunctioncA keyword, 
       all at the  beginning of a line. 

      - lscollapse-all(3)lmcollapse-all(3)le (un)folds all regions in the file, 
      - lscollapse-current(3)lmcollapse-current(3)le (un)folds the current region. 

    cDNavigation via Item ListcA

       The Octave mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying an outline
       of the functions of the octave file for easy navigation using the 
       lsitem-list(3)lmitem-list(3)le command. 

    cDAbbreviationscA

       The  installation  comes with a default  abbreviation  file for V file
       editing which  can  be  used  by  writing  short   abbreviations like
       "cCfocA" (for), "cCifcA", "cCeicA" (elsif) or "cCfucA" (function) - 
       and then pressing the key-binding  for the lsexpand-abbrev-handle(3)lmexpand-abbrev-handle(3)le command.
       The  list  of  abbreviations  can be used  interactively  in the GUI version of
       MicroEmacs using the lsabbrev-list(3)lmabbrev-list(3)le command.

    cDShort CutscA
    
       The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-

       cDC-c C-ccA - Comment out the current line.  
       cDC-c C-dcA - Uncomment the current line.  
       cDC-c C-ecA - Comment to the end of the line with hashes (#).  
       cDA-C-icA - Restyle the current region.  
       cDesc qcA - Format a comment.  
       cDesc ocA - Format a comment.  
       cDf2cA - (Un)fold the current region.  
       cDf3cA - (Un)fold all regions.  
       cDf6cA - Display the item list.
